Michiel Kramer seems a very good target man/poacher with good positioning.\\n\\nMark Uth for SC Heerenveen has scored 14 from 30 at 23 years of age. He is also going to be out of contract at the end of the season if i recall correctly. He is 6'1\" and quite agile on the ball and equally strong on both feet.\\n\\nJust some options...\\nI would like us to delve through lower English Leagues for consistent goal scorers like Charlie who worked their way up the ranks. A goalscorer is a goalscorer regardless of the league they are in. Apart from Soldado, he is just shit.    2\n",

  terrific shame  feel  have the individual players  stay  but they not producing the team performance  need  doesn seem  long ago  were sitting pretty   sustained  position  find  difficult  understand why things have gone  badly for   quickly


Perhaps  something   with the sheer amount  change  the club  takes time  settle  team  players  may also  the case that figures like Barton weren  retrospect the characters  needed  such  vulnerable time

Also  think there has been  issue with making decisions about whether  play members  the previous squad  the new additions there not been  settled team  Mackie   out and out striker yet   seldom played  that role instead  have invested  other out and out strikers  Mackie  played   supporting role which doesn suit him SWP plays  all sorts  roles across the pitch whilst players like Helguson and  Campbell have been  and out with injury


Would Warnock have kept    was split about his sacking  heart said keep him  head saw  was loosing   bit  weird tactics against  Dons and small rants after games  retrospect  difficult  imagine  could done worse than Hughes has since then though  not sure some new characters  the squad could have continued with Warnock they seemed  have made their mind    right  play against Leeds next season will  interesting  see what reception Warnock gets from the hoops  think  can guess

That just one reason The signings  Barton and SWP have been counterproductive though  think Ferdinand has been decent and  unfortunate that the team    now face  pretty stiff run  fixtures  the takeover had happened earlier  the summer  would all  different  you either have  completely restructure  incorporate new players into  old system Rushing through signings  deadline day left  without  gameplan   system  play and since then  been the opposite  the coherent unit  last season",175,2012-03-10

superhoops," Jamie Mackie  Just for his uncanny knack  scoring goals when  most need them The man has immense bottle alongside his tireless workrate The epitome  QPR

 Clint Hill  Pulled off  few absolutely epic tackles  keep   games  had  win Not  mention bending the laws  physics with that late backheader against Spurs  think

 Djibril Cisse  Yup  for   born goalscorer and  player the  had been crying out for Banged  goals that needed banging  when  wasn suspended  course That record  scoring  being sent off  every game  just could not have happened  any other club

 Anton Ferdinand  Nearly always looks solid and reliable  does not mess around when the ball    dangerous area and deals with   exactly what you want   centreback

 Samba Diakite   genuinely exciting prospect Putting aside how much   maniac  looked  his first appearance  has looked  class act ever since The thought  him pairing  with Faurlin next year has  drooling

 Sean Derry  Not always  commanding this season   was the year before but has certainly had his standout moments not least  which  beating Theo Walcott   sprint for  loose ball

 Heidar Helguson  Back  the dark ages  the first half  this season there was one man who looked headand shoulders above the rest  his team and the opposition defense  the penalty area The iceman himself

 Paddy Kenny  Looked  shadow  his former self  the first half  the season but turned  around just  time pulling off some crucial blinding saves since the beginning  the Hughes era

 Adel Taarabt  Took his sweet time reminding everyone what  talent   but again did the business when  was really needed Still does  least one thing  every game that blows  mind Hoping  get off   flyer next year

 Luke Young  Remember him  would still have him  right back over Onouha    lineup and  went   bit   remarkable scoring run  one point before getting unlucky with injuries  hope  returns next year

superhoops,"Our memories are poor some players have only been with  for half  season whilst others have been injured These topten lists are  little superficial but can give   chance  highlight some  the good points  the QPR squad

 here  list

 Clint Hill For putting   shift  work and showing  level  commitment and ability that gone beyond the call  duty and any expectation   worthy   tophalf  club  and  think  loaned him out  Nottingham before Xmas 

 Jamie Mackie Similar reasons  Clint Hill Someone  Open all  said Mackie gaining the touch and control    player  like  gorilla learning  play the flute   never expected   another example  someone who stepped   the plate Perhaps the   not  far ahead  the   this continues   become  true QPR great And  you heard him  the Open all  podcast you know  LOVES playing for the hoops

 Shaun Derry  times  been  little off the  pace but  often see the confidence that comes with great experience and some  his passing has been sublime  beyond anything  could have expected  even seen  Brazilianlike touch develop His ability  stop  attacker and take the ball has continued unabashed into the 

 Anton Ferdinand Greatly improved  last  games was   poor run  form likely due  the Terry saga  solid defender and  think potential captain material

 Armand Traore  wear Derry name  the back   QPR home shirt Second choice for  shirt would  Traore  mature unassuming professional  had such good form earlier  the year  used  breath  sigh  relief when  got the ball Plays with great intelligence and  the best  our Summer buys Since  missed  few games  put him below Ferdinand

 Samba Diakite For his first  games  thought  made  huge mistake  had  record   Nancy  yellow cards  long  your arm and looked set  continue his bad disciplinary record  Loftus road Then something happened  think   the most skilled player  can remember seeing  Loftus road   adult life  can wait  see him recover from the virus and continue into next season what  immense player  acquired Would have been higher  the list   have played more often

 Adel Taarabt Last year  have been towards the top  this list Dubbed the incredible sulk for most  the season  didn want  play for QPR and that showed  his awful awful performances Clearly Hughes appeals  his ego which has caused some kind   genetic mutation   see Taarabt tracking back and defending for the first time   hooped shirt Long may  continue   still with  next season  look forward  seeing more  this work ethic  troubles any  team long may  continue  mature

 Paddy Kenny Was number    for  last year Was not done  huge favour  periods  awful defending this season which now seem  have been sorted Should  lauded  all  football for his efforts  the Etihad but  too low down the pecking order for that right now Has been caught standing  few times during the season hope  see him return  full confidence next season

 Taye Taiwo The man smile exudes love  know that not  factor for this list but  just wanted  make  note  
Took  while  settle into the club has become  huge brick  the QPR defensive wall and has  amazing touch  times What about that freekick against Sunderland Wow Looking forward  see more  the new season

 Cisse Don get sent off and become one  the greatest players  QPR history alongside Les Ferdinand

Also

Potential new captain Ferdinand  Derry

Replacement for Barton  midfield Faurlin

Have you noticed Ferdinand has  strict routine when  gets onto  pitch running  the corner flag and going through  set  movements  the beginning  each half   also ALWAYS the last QPR player  leave the pitch hanging  wasting time until  seen all other players have gone

Looking forward  Diakite and Faurlin return Wow

Bobby Zamora Sorry  completely underwhelmed Aside from the Etihad game  been unable  move with the ball  times  looks depressed and    doesn want    Loftus road Holding  the ball  something  expect most professional players   able     single ability   worth the most expensive player  ever bought  our history  waiting   impressed

Tommy Smith  you remember him   our  team Got   points against Everton away and scored one  the goals  the season against Wigan   were    week   given more   chance      peanuts   lucky  make   the bench Usually scores along the floor and has ability  can use Let see   makes  appearance next season",942,2012-05-18

For several reasons Hughes does not know his best eleven one reason  that the best eleven probably haven appeared  the pitch together yet


 Injuries

 think  one point recently  had  players injured Again that   recipe for disaster  any club Our fortunes will not begin  change until this damage  repaired


Hughes

Let  state the obvious Hughes has changed too much too soon  think  been dogmatic about ripping out old players who were reliable enough  get  few goals  each season and could  trusted upon  scrape  successful  unattractive defensive performance when backs are against walls

All  the football world knew QPR had  poor defense  need  strengthening and depth Hughes left  until the dying days  the transfer window after being ked  Swansea   acquire some defenders aside from Nelsen  Fabio

 see  football snobbery  Hughes player selection  desire  play toplevel football before the team can even walk using highly paid players from topflight teams and old friends rather than taking reliable talent perhaps even from lower leagues  shows  real lack  pragmatism that the likes  Warnock survive and thrive  each season


The Facebook crazies

   the opinion they are casual supporters who don often   games and seldom watch  game   Amongst other things they call for players who aren even  the named   start games  easy  type trash   social media site   many football players know   just leave   that 
When     game the supporters  speak  seem sane and levelheaded  only once heard  older longterm supporter call for  manager   that was when  old workmate called into TalkSport after our  draw   Dons


Park

 obviously not captain material  doesn speak Speaking   basic requirement   captain Having said that neither Warnock nor Hughes seem  give two hoots about the captains armband yet  usually seems  protect the wearer from being subbed   wasn until Barton was  bad  became just too embarrassing that  was taken off  least Hughes has  far subbed Park once


Derry

Won score goals but   captain  defense  all know  was the practical captain during our promotion year There are Facebook crazies who seriously believe Taarabt marshaled the team  success  call that view retarded   have  other explanation for 
Derry has  very level head very vocal and has  footballing brain  suspect   only Hughes dogma that keeps Derry out  the line

Barton

 don care about his tweets his personality  the music  listens   care that Barton was mostly sxxt last season  singlehandedly lost   least  games  being pure sxxt All our current midfielders are better than him   did anything slightly good   game many people watching  would sing his praises There  reason  this earth  take him back into the fold during the January transfer window  glad Beard has said there  way back for him",634,2012-10-08
superhoops," quick browse  the web QPR forums reveals pretty widespread panic Many  the debates focus around the following topics

 Hughes should  fired Various replacements suggested Harry Redknapp the big name alternative

 Park has been  disappointment both   captain and  player

  need Joey Barton back  add aggression  the midfield

 The defensive personnel Nelson excepted are not good enough and should  overhauled  January

 known superhoops  offer more considered responses   wondered what you lot have  say about all this Could   said that  any sense  moving  the right direction What changes can  made that will see  picking  points 

Personally  think the answers  these debate topics are    and 

 Hughes has  awful record  far but  need stability now not more unrest

 Park should accept  much responsibility  the rest  the squad but should not  made  scapegoat The captaincy issue   red herring   has been for  few seasons  Loftus Road

  have  better centre midfielders than Barton 

  have some squad selection issues Hill should not  playing  left back SWP should not  starting Derry inclusion  the team would help with organisation leadership and concentration but the personnel  not the problem January would  better spent selling players than buying The key  improvement lies  the training ground primarily  stopping the defensive errors

Lots  good performances apart from our  strikers
 thought Zamora mostly had  stinker   game   going  have the task  holding  the ball  need  win   the air more and successfully pass   our players

superhoops,"Overall positive performance disappointing result Here  player  player analysis

Cesar  Solid top top keeper unfortunate for the  Some people complain  flaps  punches too much but that just his style and  generally gets good distance  the ball 

Nelsen  Once again proving    great addition and just  shame  isn  years younger commanding and what  lacks  pace  makes  for  positional sense Felt  could have done better with the header  the first half though should have scored 

Mbia   reckon once  settles   the rhythm  the league    absolute weapon Great composure good  the ball does like   forwards alot  realise  prefers  play  CDM but was assured  the back  like  see him   bit better  the air too 

Bosingwa  Again  reasonable performance did well  keeping Baines and Pienaar reasonably quiet Felt his crossing was poor this game though and communication with other defenders was  issue  times but that  whole defense more than just  Bosingwa issue 

Traore  Hopefully  can get his fitness back because  makes such  difference than when  had  put Hill   His pace  such  asset and  links   well with Taraabt down the left side Arguably our best crosser  the ball too just needs  work  positional play  bit more 

Park  Did  job this game without being spectacular  think  does  lot  grunt work that people don give him credit for and had some great sliding tackles but too many misplaced passes and spent too long  the ball  couple  times 

Granero  What  player this guy   assured  the ball and links  brilliantly with the rest  the midfield and the attack his ability  turn with the ball   tight area  get away from his man  incredible Controlled the midfield and has  decent set piece  him once settled  could  our best player this season and for  joint man  the match 

Diakite  Quiet first half didn really get involved much but changed  all around  the second  has raw talent  abundance the ability  glide past players   beauty  watch just needs  lock down some consistency Still  scares the bejeebus out   everytime  goes  for  tackle  either  brilliant tackle  attempted murder   can keep that second half performance     superstar 

Taarabt  Again undoubted talent  this guy and was shown  the first half everytime  gets the ball    unpredictable long pass short pass trick shot you never know what   His link  play has improved  worlds and him and Traore had  fantastic understanding down the left side this game Was fairly anonymous  the second half though again needs  get involved  bit more 

Zamora   workhorse performance albeit  slightly disappointing one Defensively  was absolutely woeful and  fault for the goal conceded For   didn win enough  the air either Everton looked  have  people  him  most times which made  difficult for him but  should  doing  bit better Couple  poor decisions and some  his passing needs    bit crisper but  keep him  the team  try and bully Arsenal defense next week 

Hoilett  Hasn been given enough   chance this year for  but proved his worth this game  was just all energy running forward tracking back Great ability  cut inside players and shoot and was only denied  couple more goals from some great saves from Howard  like him  that front roll working off Zamora and   can keep the same energy levels and work  his final product  bit will score  hatful this year  other joint MoM ",715,2012-10-21

 half time  was feeling good about our performance  shown character and  great work rate taking all they could throw

The second half saw  few very close calls where Chelsea broke deeper into our penalty box and Lampard had  goal disallowed for offside then the tables changed and SWP did something  never done for QPR before and scored  goal   league game

Naturally the  fans went nuts Grabbing random strangers and hugging them  only   seen   football game and   ecstasyinduced rave party  the Bridge yesterday SWP provided the class

Sunderland Managed  nill all draw  the Stadium  Light last time against Sunderland and  strange turn  events QPR actually had more possession and more shots should  one better against them  Home and create some momentum with two wins   row

Aston Villa Could  either way here but   going  back the   win this one and  notch  there third win  the trot Aston Villa have been very unconvincing all season and   still sticking  the prediction  made  the beginning  the season that they will get relegated

 far  the fullbacks   glad  see Onuoha given chances and making good  seemed very out  favour only  few months ago Fabio was one  our better players today  the beginning  the season  was worried every time  went  one  his sallies forth into offensive positions Norwich anyone but today  looked  control and very dangerous Rafael seems  have cemented his place  United    stay   might get  chance  sign him  should spring  the chance

Unfortunately the other player  got from United was the exception today Perhaps Park age  catching  with him but  seems reluctant  get stuck into challenges whenever there   for the ball  midfield  always seems  end  going the opposition way

Pleased    with the overall performance  have  say that  still left Loftus Road frustrated Unfortunately   that stage  our season where  need   claiming points even from unlikely places  draws are  good when  need  climb quickly  Tottenham had come out and absolutely run  over then fair enough  they  superb team when they get into their stride But today  shut them down and  kept them out And with the three golden chances that fell  SWP you have expected  least one  them  end   the net But none did and  feels more like two points lost than one point gained",434,2013-01-12

superhoops,"Congratulations  Dons You deserved the win


 was  the game with  Lazio fan  remarked that   goal was good value  just  shame  came from Sundayleaguelevel footie And Are they QPR always this shit  good question


Rangers fans were pretty much silent the entire game aside from some booing  the game progressed  Dons fans sung for most  the match The Dons took their chances  which there were about  But that all they needed for  goals plus  early gift from Traoré


There are rumours  played  back four  remember seeing Tal Ben Haim defending our goal beyond that  Ferdinand maintained perfectly white sparkly shorts for the  mins


 appreciate that  should try not  singleout individuals but Ferdinand and Park plumbed new depths Ferdinand didn want    the pitch and was embarrassingly bad Park was basically booed  the point Harry took pity  him and considering the potential threat  shirt sales replaced him with the stillfit Bobby Zamora who did his usual thing  moving around  the opposition half whilst looking back  our goal and generally bumping into opposition players whilst fumbling the ball  his feet sorry those who know  are aware  not  Zamora fan


Player performance


Granero Scrappy very poor quality play  the second half  started trying  win the game  his own Schoolboy football  massive disappointment

Faurlin Awful possession Very poor pass completion Terrible positional play  hate  say  but  seems   getting worse with each game  shadow  his former self

Green Seemed   half asleep Spent  lot  time complaining  the defence and referee with some justification  didn seem bothered with the game

Park  times people stared  him wondering what  was actually doing Scraping for the ball and throwing himself  opposition players whilst barely staying  his feet   not sure  completed more than half  dozen passes Being taken off was  show  mercy  Harry part

Mackie  effort terrible finishing  had several chances  knock   the net that verged  open goals but bottled   all love Mackie but  often lacks the finish    player Today  showed

 Silva Spent too much time  the opposition box and little time defending the QPR goal Was easily caught out  simple Don longballs over his head Seemed   trying which showed with the goal Showed  lack  respect for the opposition which cost 

Ben Haim Was  member  the Bermuda triangle back   the  half  was sitting line with the defence  was one  the few that played  that area Wasn  good enough performance for   game  see how  gets 

Zamora Was suprised  see him warming   halftime Did his general Zamora thing for the final  mins Assisted the Bothroyd goal Seemed more  for  than most  our players

Traoré Scored  own goal Actually looked very good for most  the game committed  the game and kept going past MKD players  the wing Impressed  Lazio pal 

 Campbell Often looked threatening His disallowed goal was  goal  wasn offside Should have been more coordinated with his team mates Would likely  better with more playing opportunities Was often crowded out   men  the box

Bothroyd  big tall guy should have scored  few from set pieces  wandered around  front  lot but failed  impress and took  few poor shots  goal Otherwise rather anonymous


Ferdinand The worst player  the pitch  the game progressed  began scaring both the crowd and Green  looking likely  score own goals Was half asleep and disinterested  important  get another   the window

 

 played our secondstring nonfirsteleven players today Some  them are  very serious money There  excuses they should have easily beaten  league  side


  stay  the Premier league all will  forgotten    that was  awful experience for QPR fans will have done player morale  good and may have further harmed our chances  signing new players



What arewere your thoughts


 The  ticket price was  hint that Harry wasn particularly looking  win the game but  see who  those players was  for the fight the rest  will look  cast aside   view Mackie Traoré despite his owngoal Ben Haim and possibly Fabio were  the rest can  got rid   buyers can  found",813,2013-01-26

 starting  feel optimistic about next season  think  down  the number  QPR players who have come out and said there was  serious problem  the squad  what  could all see but during the season  difficult for players  admit the issues for fear  making things worse

Hill Fabio Green Derry Jennas and Townsend have all said the same there were serious splits  the team which were  bad even Harry couldn fix them

Everyone now sees the same issues and  hope will work together  fix them

  few weeks the transfer  window will open Harry and the board will have had enough time  sort out  plan The experience  last summer and the  season should have given the board  very harsh initiation into football management there are  shortcuts

 expect  majority  last season players  stay  the club  desperately need  strikers Johnson and Zamora will  fortunate  play even most games and with    games  week  the   likely they  out injured before  are  months into the campaign
 love  see   Campbell given  chance  play next season the crowd will adore him and  has shown how effective  can   the Championship Let hope Harry takes punt


Derry and possibly even Hill are coming towards the end  their football careers  time  look for new blood  favor  slow transition preferably bringing  some  the QPR youth and other players who have the potential   long stay  the club


Everyone  QPR and all QPR fans agree  what caused the issues last season let hope the board and Harry don look for  more shortterm quick fixes Instead  like  see QPR build  solid backbone  the team that will provide opportunities  bring  youth Then perhaps  can again see  QPR  are proud ",357,2013-06-02

Agree  that they need  shake  the striker situation All too often Zamora looked  discomfort after  spell  play  which  was involved came   end and god knows what become  Andy Johnson after his injury Definitely want Campbell  stay What about Bothroyd  scored  good number  goals for Cardiff  this level but  rather they went out and brought  someone younger All  the above are the other side    Balanta worth bringing into the rotation yet

 defense you are looking  Clint Hill and Nedum Onuoha  the only two who have been with QPR for any length  time  Newcomers include Danny Simpson with three seasons   experience and Richard Dunne with  staggering amount   experience   think these two could   great asset  QPR  Lastly  have  factor  SukYoung Yoon whose opportunity  shine for QPR  now   mainstay for the Korea  and  teams Yoon has looked good  preseason and has the potential  make the difference for QPR this year   transferred out Bosingwa Samba and Ben Haim    opinion these players were all cruft and  glad they are gone  Armand Traore looks   leaving the club  well with offers reportedly  the table for this services

Moving  midfield  think  are doing alright  Stephane Mbia Shaun WrightPhillips Junior Hoilett Jermaine Jenas these are the types  players who can  prolific  the Championship  Even though Jenas  creeping   age  was  regular for Tottenham and has enjoyed years   experience  Then  have Granero and Samba Diakite who are excellent but appear    the chopping block    doubtful that Taarabt would play and even   could  don think his attitude  welcome  the team any longer   cannot forget Shaun Derry whose attitude and work ethic has been paramount  QPR development since    may not feature but his presence will hopefully inspire those  the pitch  step    level  Karl Henry our new signing  the midfield had  three year stint  the  with Wolves and seems  have the attitude that  Championship player needs for his team  prevail  Lastly Joey Barton  still  member  the squad and while the past few months have been tumultuous  best  may find himself playing  the Championship with QPR this season  His skills would  useful but  think  depends more  his attitude and commitment  the team

 think most people would agree when  say that  lot  our problems lie  the striker position  Obviously signing Gary Hooper would been immense but that didn happen   all just have  forget about    have Bobby Zamora and Andy Johnson both are past  and injuryprone  Even though they have both gone  record  the summer touting their renewed fitness  one  them goes down and  are  serious trouble  Johnson has looked sharp  preseason and has  eye for goal together with Zamora  think the two would  well together  They each have significant  experience but truly  think  need another striker  his  who can take over the brunt  the work  With Johnson and Zamora supporting  third striker the team would  complete   opinion

 was lucky enough  attend the game tonight and this thread will outline  observations from the  James Road end

   frank  view  this was poor   was scored  the Big Bank net home terrace from what  can gather the ball deflected off Charlie Austin into the net His first goal for the   the second minute

 Quality goal scored  Danny Simpson  the  minute just inside the box  our end   remember correctly His first goal for the Hoops and not  bad one either

Points  Interest

 Joey Barton played started
 SWP hit the bar and then the post within minutes  each other after coming    secondhalf substitute
  brought  fans  very good showing
 Barton took all corners which  arguably questionable but not dissimilar  the norm
 Murphy played the whole game thanks  theagitatist for pointing this out

 Personal Highlight

One  our corners  the away end drew Andy Johnson into Krysiak net where  responded  some positive banter with our fans and then preceded  have  quick sip  the Exeter keeper drink and then pour the rest out onto the grass whilst winking and smiling   All  this was unbeknownst  Krysiak and the corner was taken  usual

superhoops," great result  had plenty  shots but couldn find the net Aside from  couple  breaks through our defence one from Dunne who  the size   houses poor passback  Green Ipswich hardly had  shot  our goal

Zamora had another very poor game Again SWP was beating him  headers The crowd got quite fed with Zamora poor passing lack  interception and general lack  effort   looked very unfit and nervous  heard that some fans even started booing him  didn hear the booing and hope  not true

SWP looked   playing well and kept winning the ball  looked pretty amazing  some points with his effort and possession Jnr Hoilett was great again  hope his injury isn serious The back  looked  have improved though that may have been due  the quality  the opposition 

Rob Green took nasty abuse from Ipswich fans throughout the game  got   quite viscous after  while because    played for Norwich their rival team apparently After his celebration  the end  can imagine what  will  like when  visit their place
Green made  great fingertip save  the first half and generally looked most confident  seen him despite the abuse

Joey Barton had another great game  received standing ovations from  block and others  chanted for him several times including  new one

  sounds like all has been forgiven which  true  long   keeps putting  performances like those  seen from him this season Some  his passing over distance was pretty amazing

Interestingly Clint Hill moved  into  wing position through  lot  the game that could have been due   lack  pressure from Ipswich

All  all QPR looked  level above the opposition the issue was the creativity setting ourselves  for  goal  also think that Zamora has become  waste   position  are starting games with  players  best until   subbed off then  seem  score

  huge improvement  last season This was  first game  Loftus Road this season and  was impressed  the team spirit  display Rather than giving  after the first goal went   was  often the case last season  kept trying  win the game for the full  minutes

 Sean Wright Phillips needs     pace but that seems   about   getting tired  watching him the run the ball  nowhere  getting muscled off the ball  was down the other end but  looked like  missed  sitter oneone with the keeper 

 Zamora needs  take  pay cut    think   useful player  have around but squandered too many chances last night  justify his wages

Let  talk about our transfers out

Cisse   was  loan last season and took  free  some club  Russia  one cares about Not sure how much his wage was but  was initially   signing

Samba  Let  honest Samba was  last second prayer  keep   the    didn work and now   gone back  the same club  came   got  for him and  was  wages  week  Good one  get off the books

Mackie   think  lot  people agree this transfer may not have been  our best interests  Mackie was useful  front and more specifically had heart  Regardless  sold him  Forest for 

Bosingwa    wage  week  had  get him off the books   took  free  Trabzonspor and  one from QPR  looking back

Remy  Another huge earner  around week  needed  lose him  well  Took  loan  Newcastle  wouldn have made much sense for him  play  the Championship anyway

Taarabt   about week Taarabt was yet another high earner that  needed  offload  stay afloat  Took  loan  Fulham which seems    good move for both clubs

Park  Another huge earner taking  about week  Took  loan  his previous club PSV and got him off our wage bill

Granero  Initially   signing for QPR Granero was  flop  the  and has been loaned  Real Sociedad  Expressed interest during the transfer window  staying with QPR but wage probably offloaded for wage purposes

Bia  Initially   signing Bia had the heart  play  the  but not necessarily the skill  Bia expressed interest  staying with QPR but has been loaned  Sevilla most likely due  wage offloading purposes


Overall  offloaded about   weekly wages which for  Championship team could mean the difference  keeping  afloat financially   still have some big earners  the wage bill particularly Onuoha and  few others but their ability and heart  the pitch justifies their wage    interesting  note however that most  these transfers were season long loans which means all  these players will  returning next season  This bodes well   make  back  the  but   don  could   some serious trouble financially


Transfers 
Simpson  Free transfer from Newcastle     years   experience and   years  age Simpson has  real chance  solidify  first team place  the squad

Dunne  Free transfer from Aston Villa  Older   but adds depth  the back with almost  decade  experience  the   Has had some problems with fitness

 Henry   signing from Wolves  Three years  experience Slightly old   years  age  One  the big reasons  decided  join was Harry Redknapp  Interesting  note  was part  the Wolves squad when they were promoted from the Championship  the 

Austin   signing from Burnley   goals  last two seasons  Championship   years  age  Austin can make  difference  front  the Championship and has proven    has been sloppy for   far but when  hits form  won  taking scrappy wins any longer

Neil  Free transfer from West Ham  Plethora   experience previously played for Portsmouth  Adds depth and experience  the midfield position  Older   years  age

First off the stadium  would estimate   full over  fans  total and our fans sold our allowance  approximately  tickets

Unfortunately  bought  tickets late   had  settle for  place  the crowded Yeovil fans standing terrace and being surrounded  livid Glovers for near ninety  especially the last thirty  minutes  was  great experience although next time  definitely  booking early for the Rangers end

The lineup was rather changed from the outfit  started against Brighton  Wednesday evening eyebrows especially being raised over Barton starting  the bench apparently   one booking away from suspension  true then  doesn explain why  was brought  for the late minutes   can only presume Arry was resting him  from what  have all seen  far  player possessing Barton newfound traits  fight and determination will  muchwelcomed  our bid for promotion this season

Another point albeit probably influenced  the Yeovil supporters around    have never seen  game where nearly all  the decisions went our way including the penalty that got  our win   good decision from what  could see despite being  the far end  the pitch

The pressure after our goal was intense and unrelenting however despite Yeovil getting  sizeable number  chances  didn ever feel that they looked particularly like scoring

Standout players for  were Benoit Traore Rob Green BAE was pulling off  lot  intelligent tricks and skill moves  beat opposing wingers under pressure and also made some pinpoint crosspitch passes all lofted which required very little movement from the recipient Traore looked particularly dangerous moving forward especially  the first half  being  attacker who isn afraid  charge  defences and work the ball into the box His second half game waned however Tom Carroll performed his role well enough  compensate Facing  number  difficult curling shots and driven attempts  his bottom corner Rob Green pulled off some fantastic saves Had  not been  such great form  could have easily lost the game  when you compare our chances  Yeovil

Ultimately  hardfought arguablydeserved win and more importantly three points  the board keeping  top  the Championship  feel our goalscoring form will improve  the season goes  and  will beat weaker opposition like Yeovil  three  four perhaps though some good deals  the lateend  the loan window wouldn  amiss

 would have been  lot better  Hoilett would pass occasionally although  was our standout attacking player Austin looked  bit ineffective although  was being marked very closely  did  lot more than him when  came

superhoops,"Yeah  would say bolstering the midfield with guys who are premiership quality and  their prime   must Enough with the guys who are over the hill and  their  

Obviously another striker  give  another option would  very handy although   think Austin Johnson and Hitchcock might  enough for the rest  the season

   get promoted  would say another centre half would  necessary Onouha Hill and Dunne won cut  next season Onouha  god enough but Hill and Dunne will cause  problems",97,2014-01-05
superhoops,"Many  are left asking the same questions after today embarrassing loss against  andcoming Everton side  While most  expected  loss they halfhoped   able  keep  interesting   was about  interesting for the   their attacking record   late  paltry  goals   games   mean Blackpool  all teams who sit    the table were able  hold off the likes  Manchester City  they fought    draw


  consider ourselves Promotion contenders then certainly being able  match  with and compete with  clubs  the true goal   barely looked    can compete with teams  our own division   late  Yet  some miracle  are only  single point off   automatic promotion place  That miracle however has  real name the back four  Benoit AssouEkotto Clint Hill Richard Dunne Danny Simpson and more recently Nedum Onouha  With the exception  Hill and Dunne now  their midthirties  would have  concerns believing the others could compete  the Premiership  


The problem has never been our defence though  has always come from higher  the pitch  Midfield but more  attack  where  all breaks down  Playing  front with Charlie Austin  you guessed  nobody  There   one playing  front with Charlie Austin most  the time Somehow Austin still finds  way  make  goal out   and that has been our saving grace  some days  can get Andy Johnson into the action for  minutes but thus far his fitness has been the real problem  There also Bobby Zam  never mind there   body else  The addition  Hitchcock back into the side  positive but  will surely take  least one more from the transfer market  get  back  business  Going forward with Charlie Austin Tom Hitchcock Andy Johnson and  January transfer would surely   step  the right direction  And steps they must surely  for   take too big  step  too short  time   have  previous transfer windows  will ruin our progress and fall off the ladder completely

For this reason the midfield can stay the same  Between Joey Barton and Matt Phillips the clear midfield core  have enough other options  get   the Championship  The only other midfielder considered Premiership quality would  Junior Hoilett based  his sheer potential even though his progress   late has stalled  Between the Summer transfer window and our returning loanees  will have more than enough options  hash out  midfield competitive  the highest level  English football

Today loss may have made  look  team not  any way deserving   place  the Premier League but realistically  are not that far off from being  team that can compete  the top tier One solid striker  January will   long way  helping  reach that goal",524,2014-01-05
superhoops,"The thing that fucked this squad was the fact that  missed out  Gary Hooper  the summer window Harry original plan had him and Austin forming the core  the attack which would also  able  keep  afloat  the premiership 

Thing  the back line  you pointed out  keeping  going  preference would   have  mean defense  rely  Once  system   place  keeps itself going and also  most other sports   defense which wins you big games etc  then enables   win ugly and personally    get points  the board  happy  doesn make for  great final product for the fans  times like today but being  the top    great place especially after the cluster fuck  last season  

Harry IMO had  fundamental change  the way  thinks about football after being fired  Tottenham and when  was thinking about managing England the whole thing about bringing  Brendan Rodgers and playing  different style   has switched  possession based football and packing the midfield which seems   the style much more  the continent than    home with that emphasis  one striker rather than  Again had  had Hooper  may  playing two  front with  packed midfieldmix  wingers with Barton and another playmaker  the middle  the park Either way  wants  keeping the ball rather than handing  initiative  the opposing team  theory  far  has panned out  times but has seen  struggle  other moments the Championship  much more  slug fest than the Prem that  what  need  keep  mind  think the plan was  implement the system this season with  eye   being ready for when  promoted and  think that the higher ups will  hedging their bets   going  this season but  lacked that second strikerother winger  finish the opportunities  create Hoilett seems  have  hamstring made  glass 

Long story short  think Harry   the process  trying  implement  new system while having  integrate  fair number  players  done  good job  far  shipping dead weight though some still remains and     keen   appears   add  striker  Jelavic caliber hoping the fact that Kranjcar  getting time with Croatia working  our favour then  should  find for the rest  this season baring some minor tweaks such   replacement for Carroll   leaves  still hoping for  automatic spot   think out defense will outlast Burnley strikers and Derby form  well 

Anyway apologies for this wall  text  just that  spent  lot  time thinking about how management   appears  have been trying  think one step ahead this term  terms  strategy rather than looking for quick fixes which means that  still   period where the squad and system are getting used  one another 

Again   talking utter shite then please tell  

 Striker such  Jelavic and possible replacement for Carroll and  should  good New System and new way  thinking means this season   growing period

How  Harry doing Personally  think  harsh  blame him for performances like last night considering how  lot   have said before the season started that not getting relegated would   achievement   disappointing     see such  lackluster show last night  the grand scheme  things  doing alright and Harry  doing his job just fine   book

Tom Carroll  think  very good technically but some teams  this division are very physical and  small players like Tom will get bullied off the ball  perhaps last night and  other times  hasn been the best selection Although  have watched him play against weaker teams such  Yeovil this season where  found him   decent  the ball

Niko Kranjcar  obviously very talented and watching him sometimes  like watching Taarabt although this applies when  playing both well and badly  got some great goals for  this season and  times his individual flair has been very useful however  can  infuriating  watch him arrogantly give the ball away through deliberately risky passes and swagger around the pitch when  chasing the game

Jermaine Jenas Haven seen  lot  him this season   honest would say that   player  have enough  and don particularly need  retain although this obviously depends  who  lose and bring  come the summer Decent work rate

AssouEkotto Similar  Kranjcar  that   very talented yet doesn seem  care much for the team  think that fair  say However  has been one  our most consistent performers this season   not going  slate him The Burnley home fixture recently was poor because the third goal especially was his fault for thinking  could physically beat the Burnley attacker but everyone makes mistakes The thing that made  angry with him was that when  got knocked over  looked  saw Burnley would score and went down holding his knee instead  getting  and  least trying  win the ball back rather than pathetically trying  save face That and the way you think  learn from his mistake yet invited the same pressure and gave away  least two identical chances from the same mentality later  the game once  injury time But other than that game  has been great for

 like Arsenal  that  can get results against the topthetable clubs

BAE  Kranjkar are great  have lots  individually skilled players what  don have   welldeveloped team The Championship  particularly about team ethic With the exception  Hill  Green our team has been cobbled together during this season and continues   added 

When McClaren went  was just  few games before our defence started losing  shape  slowly let more goals  since then There   popular idea that McClaren coaching was responsible for the great results early   our season

Harry  great  attracting relatively big names  our club but what  are not seeing  the formation   QPR team

 are usually predictable  the first half  wait for the opposition  come    often   goal down  halftime Harry gives everyone  bollocking then  get  goal back for  point   manage  win That can work against poor teams but won get you anywhere against  organised group  players

 Corner  QPR really good period  pressure from Rangers  definitely the better team  far Leeds passing has been poor  kept them  the back foot

 Back from  break  despair just after  wrote the above passage Dunne gave away  penalty  thought  was very harsh and couldn watch  Apparently Green saved   returned  time  see  free kick converted  McCormack  Couldn have got off   worse start unless they scored the penalty Seems like our early pressing has been reversed too Doyle almost went off injured but  staying   seems Before the game Arry said  had three more players injured with hamstring afflictions yesterday  but  didn say who they were

 Jermaine Jenas levels just before the break lovely finish from just inside the box  controlled Rangers starting  play again Corner  QPR gives Hill  free header puts  wide and  visibly disappointed Very positive scenes just before the break here some beautiful play just before the goal too  three consecutive backheels  the Leeds penalty box

 Watching the analysis  the penalty   the time  was livid that  was given because  didn feel  was  pen and the footage shows that Dunne does just about touch the ball  the lino doesn give  instead follows the ball   rolls out and signals  corner  was only the referee that thought  was  penalty

The club has big plans and presumably the money  place  fuel those plans but that doesn guarantee these things will happen  terms  more tangible assets they have simply got  ageing senior squad  playing and coaching staff  charismatic but rickety old stadium and  training facility from which Jose Mourinho turned away  disgust upon first seeing    quest for  temporary replacement for Chelsea The Championship  still  respectable league  provides  decent level  develop  squad for  few years down the line  the board start  get  work  the other projects   far off  the stadium would  Warren Farm  least should     few years That can  the first step  building  some credibility for their competence

superhoops," friend  mine works with  Premier football league clubs Yesterday  explained what happens when   team loses  string  games and even moves into the relegation zone

 his words The phones stop ringing and every day  the football club office   bad day modern football  absolutely ruthless

Apparently potential and existing sponsors stop speaking  the club  they begin  distance themselves from the situation  said there   kind  silence  common for cracks  appear amongst the staff  the pressure increases and  kind  depression falls over the place some fighting can occur  not  nice place  

All  this affects the club management greatly

 reflected  last season and the absolute mess QPR was   likely difficult  imagine the chaos  must say  have  bit more respect for Harry since hearing  friends story 

The pressure football managers are under  immense Fans the media some players the owners and then the clubs staff when times are tough all put pressure  the manager  has   one  the most high pressure high profile jobs

 friend does not support either  the clubs   Spurs fan yet  least one  the clubs have become his  team   gained  much respect for the clubs  didn have before",240,2014-04-12

 will say however that Harry has been  the game for almost all his life and has become very rich off      still the  best paid manager  the world   hasn developed  thick skin  now    little surprised  sticks  his guns  resolutely that  guess  handles the pressure pretty well Moreover  would  shocked  learn  actually gave  toss  ASR decided they wouldn  renewing their deal  have their brand plastered  Richard Dunne back next year  say QPR  relatively lucky  that  may not face the same headaches around those kinds  business issues  other clubs  whatever their failings  QPR the likes  Fernandes Beard and the Mittal clan have  decent mix  reputation contacts and business acumen

His rap sheet  pretty extensive for  now  well  exiled Faurlin made Mackie leave stacked the team with his own failed  survive  the top flight wasted time  trying  sign Bridge Parker Hooper   failing  sign enough firepower glacial wingback formations overlooking the club own youngsters loans loans loans indifferent interviews and  the end   all the evidence appears  indicate the team won  promoted this year either For  that wouldn   bad However Harry should  judged  measuring the clubs field success against the relative jangling  coins  his pocket

superhoops,"That  really interesting perspective  think  helps explain  little bit about what wrong with the team  the moment regarding their poor form Redknapp  evidently excellent  handling the circus   modern football club    survivor More often than not   winner too but even when  fails  doesn selfdestruct  exudes confidence which must help hold  club together when there are cracks appearing  all levels  the infrastructure

The downside  all that  that while those qualities are essential for  long career  football management they nothing   with football Redknapp game management  late has gone from the bad  the ridiculous  changes the lineup and often the formationstyle  play every game yet  wrong every single time  doesn appear  study the opposition often playing into their hands One single example  the way  always seems  leave hoilett out against teams who field  organised lineup  frustrate  even though hoilett great strength  that  pulls players out  position  then starts him against teams against whom  short passing  the correct option and  wastes possession and ruins patient approach play Another  the way  which  persists with the same exhausted back line that been shipping goals for months 

 many fans will remember however QPR have had many decent football managers who haven been able  handle the demands  the club off the pitch Paulo Sousa springs  mind  clearly  smart guy and  decent tactician but fell foul  the politics  the Briatore regime when Dex was sold  forest while Sousa was  holiday  memory serves There are very few managers who can excel  both sides  modern management",307,2014-04-12

Supporter Player  the Year Joey Barton Easily our most consistent player  lot  players  the team had patches  greatness during the season but Joey was good all year and had what  think  easily his best season for the club Hoping for him  show the same sort  performances and the  field leadership that  has shown all season  the playoffs

EDS Player  the Year Tommy Hitchcock Was great for the EDS Squad when  wasn out  loan Scored QPR fastest ever goal   game for the EDS squad Scored the winner for the First Team  his only game  think  not alone  saying that  deserved more chances  the First Team than the  mins  got

Goal  the Season Was very close between Austin  Charlton and Ravel  Yoevil Town loved both those goals But ended  going with the latter Such  classy goal fakes and then just slots   the opposite top corner  the direction   running and with power  remember thinking  the time that  would probably   vote for QPR Goal  the Season",210,2014-04-23

superhoops,"  don know whether  are  the Premier league  Championship Regardless  view this year   decent season because   extremely hard   down and get promotedmake   the play offs straight away the next season

  view our greatest weakness this season  creativity injuries and goalscoring Apart from some boring play Until Ravel came  Charlie was our only source  goals and when  picked   few injuries midseason our flying start  ground   stutter Many people claim Redknapp  guilty  not playing the same team week  and week out but  had  juggle potential injuries all season long  because 
our squad  getting  massive refresh next season with the below players all likely  leave

Remy Barton Taarabt Julio Cesar Zamora Stephane Mbia Esteban Granero Samba Diakite Andy Johnson Shaun WrightPhillips Jermaine Jenas and Park sung and  few  the smaller names  few will  sold and  thinking  will make about  million from the sales

  get promoted  have absolutely  idea who   getting  also don want  jinx 

  are looking for promotion again next year

IMO  Strikers  Charlie  great but  had  play  himself for the whole season Stevie May Lewis Grabban would  the realistic options and would  well Someone like Jhordan Rhodes  the fantasy one  still think that  need  decent Strikers that can  rotated with injury Maybe pickup Kevin Doyle   free

Defenders  Need   Alan Hutton could  picked   loan  brought  the cheap  know  got  tempter but  think  alright and  decent young  like Rhys Williams
Midfielders Creativity   saw this season Morrison  the dream choice Looks like  doesn want    West Ham probably could get him for about million but would  play championship football  not Chris Eagles could  got   free  the summer

Anyone got any opinion  this   looking forward  the summer because  believe  will  the clear out that  should have done  the beginning  this season and  can concentrate  getting  players who work hard and will like playing for QPR

superhoops," was impressed  the commitment  our players possibly the most effort  seen all season  can think   player that didn give full effort  though Ravel looked frustrated

Yesterday showed  the capacity  the team  are limited with lots  individual skill  have problems trying  break defences down connect    team and our passing can leave  lot   desired

Dunne

For  Dunne  far too slow  feel for the guy His attitude  right his mind  willing yet his flesh  weak  can often defend set pieces yet can catch forwards  pulls them down  trips them  Dunne  the last man  are very vulnerable 

Hill

 his own admission Clint  not  leftback  doesn have the pace However    outstanding centreback and should  played there


Our best back The back line should  Simpson Onuoha Hill amp SukYoung

Hoilett 

 love Hoillett attempts  take  the opposition  their own half  can  direct and  along with Traore  one  the few players who will run  the opposition with the ball  either going  win  freekicks  adventageous positons   going  create chances

Traore

 really like the guy doesn always click into  game but offers speed and potentialy direct play Super fast  the wing  shame  couldn hit  barn door

His forté  crosses from the wing  don see why  doesn just keep crossing into Austin  how Austin has scored  lot  the goals  his career

Ravel Morrisson

 don doubt  wanted  win last night  just seemed stuck  treacle Clearly Wigan picked him out and dealt with the threat But  still feels like  has problems getting himself into the right positon  little has come from his conribution  the last few games   wants  advice  should take  leaf out  Hoillett book and just run  the opposition with the ball  but please without looking for  freekick all the time

Midfield

Kranjkar has had trouble getting into games for quite  while now not sure what  there  want  see Benayoun start  Monday  hope Harry been savng him for that game

Our best midfield Traoré Barton Benayoun Hoillett

Forwards

Austin had  few goes last night but not back  his prolific best yet Hopefully Monday will see him shine Ultimately  needs more service which was lacking last night
 thought Doyle did  helping keep the ball  the other end  the pitch   not scared   bit  posession  some  our players feel they have  pass  soon  they receive the ball  are within  metres  the oppositon

QPR supporters

  fans went   the  The best vocal support for  long time Well done  them Now lets  even better  Monday You 

The result

Whlst  all have loved  win the draw was  better result for QPR than Wigan Make  mistake Wigan put everything they had and more into last night  have   even more  for Monday night  get that win

 course  wasn facing  language barrier  that game

 thought Ravel reaction  coming off was quite  good sign for the next one  two games  certainly  office tempexternal consultant character but  looks like  wants  perform which should  good enough for

 they stick with  the big question  who helps Barton cover the defenders Gary Neil Karl Henry  course you also have  say  few prayers that Joey himself maintains his cool  ever there  time for him not   pop this  

There  few Derby fans that have invaded WATRB for discussion  one  them said that  doesn have the greatest faith  the teams fullbacks That being the case  think Traoré and Hoilett could  useful  unlocking their flanks  worry that they have too few targets other than Austin thoughunless you abandon the lone striker gig and send  Zamora too

 definitely  with Yun soon   came   immediately had  outlet down the left that neither Hill  BAE offer  seen video  that tricky footwork  employs when taking   man but yesterday  got  see  live  their fullbacks are indeed  weak link then presumably this works  favour  including Yun  guess you just have  accept the buyer beware label  terms  the same expectations  his defensive play

 not Redknapp biggest fan but  will trust him  mix the right selection and tactics for the day  certainly not expecting  easy win All  ask  that  don get embarrassed and the players give  good account  themselves Can really ask for more than that

 Longrange effort goes wide from Austin

 Good freekick opportunity here for QPR

 into the wall

 Lots  QPR longrange shots going nowhere  the moment Derby  possession  far

 Corner for Derby produces nothing much Derby have had more  the game  far

 Penalty shout for Derby Looks like  dive after replays 

 Kranjcar goes off injured for Traore Watching this right now  nervewracking can imagine what  like being there Derby having all the pressure and when they attack  with rapid pace However neither team has created any clearcut opportunities yet Hoilett with  good run into the area loses the ball

 Great save from Rob Green from  swinging free kick that could have gone  had  not been  alert

 Traore makes  decent run after  great bit  work from Clint Hill but his shot  way offtarget

 Halftime and   Cagey



 Back out then for the second half Come  Rangers

 Lots  Derby pressure corners and crosses Bobby  preparing  come 

 Charlie Austin misses  cracking chance from about seven  eight yards out Agonizingly close Bobby now  for Doyle Best chance  the tie goes begging

 Neil sent off for  challenge just outside the box Straight red   opinion  was not the last man Hill was but  all know what Lee Mason like    shame   comes down   poor refereeing decision

Derby had huge amounts  pressure for the whole game and unbelievably Zamora snatched  with our only shot  target  injury time These are the moments that make life worth living Premier League again next year hopefully    hell   better job than  did last time And make sure soccer knows about 

Just incredible Derby were pressing   hard then away broke Hoilett and after Derby had  few great chances  clear   kept fighting won the ball and crossed  where  found Bobby who curled  around the keeper into the topleft corner Truly unbelievable

Defense  Steven Caulker  young strong and   good leader Could poach him from Cardiff for about  million potentially swap someone like Samba Diakité with  bit  cash Family still  London Also fuck Cardiff

John Heitinga  Years  experience  Everton Not too old Thought  was actually alright  Fulham Could get him   free wages would  average

Younes Kaboul   actually out  contract this summer probably will  retained but  think  fantastic And  not actually that old Fierce and  leader

For  and   think  could  with   choice Traroe will  played   midfielder  atm  only have  choice for both positions  Adam Henley  like the look  him young and also great potential  Mitch Hancox Similar  Henley Fast and young good backup and potential for future

Midfield  Robert snograss  Powerful and smart player  loyal  leader Wants out  Norwich mill Would work well with Joey  midfield Great freekicks and corners Star   terrible Norwich team last year million probably

Emmanuel Frimpong  Young and potentially  good player Could get him with  years contract low wages Could  pretty good Know  was shit  Barnsley but his heart wasn   looked good  quite  few Aresnal games   idiot but would have  laugh with Charlie and Joey

Steve Sidwell  Best Fulham player   mile last year  goal scorer even  that shocking team Already  London Free Transfer maybe average wages Hard worker

Andros Townsend   know all about him and  love him  Would give  the pace and directness  felt  lacked for  lot  last year

Kim kyung  Cardiff Korean Young Experience  the Premier League Thought  looked great   lot  Cardiff games Also fuck Cardiff

Strikers  Gary Hooper  Could get him  the cheap didn  great last year but has the potential    great midtable striker Know what  can  from Celtic Only negative   turned  down last year

Harry Kane  Fantastic  and coming striker Maybe only  loan but  think  would see this like Andros did  years ago   Die moment  his career

Peter Crouch  The Old boy and one who  know for  fact would play his socks off for  Would   fan favorite Worked with Harry before and knows all about  Was  Wembley cheering   

Championship strikers that would  cheap and good  Lewis Grabban Troy Deeney Ross McCormack All  them have  shot  stepping   the Premier League Ross McCormack would  excellent and   got relegated him and Charlie would fire  back  the Premier League   time

Not saying  should  all this business but    would set   nicely for  good challenge  staying  and would give   team that would handle  relegation battle well   sold Remy Tarrabt and Cesar  would have about  million  play with and  reckon  could get these players for this price

With this  mind many think that meeting the requirements  FFP could help save our club

Finances

This  important for  QPR fan  know

When Tony Fernandes bought his  share  the club  the Summer   for around  QPR were  debt somewhere between 
Accounts for the  season reported debts   with  loss for that season  

You see some nonQPR fans saying QPR have  wage bill bigger than some  the top European clubs They are referring  figures from the  season they are not relevant  the current squad  players Particularly  last summer  players were loaned out  left QPR

Another inaccuracy commonly stated  nonQPR fans  that some  our players were  over  per week Our top paid player was Joey Barton   per week Aside from him  the  season  QPR player was  more than  per week Still  huge amount  money but not the   thousands some people keep repeating  each other

 sensible  guess the club  now something like   debt the key thing  remember  that this  all money loaned  the  main shareholders Tony Fernandes  Lakshmi Mital   recent Fans forum Fernandes stated  likely just give the money  the club  failing the FFP regulations  the only danger  have right now

The shareholder split

 Tony Fernandes represents  group  friends from Air Aisia 

 Lakshmi Mital represented  fan favourite Amit Bhatia you have seen him  the  year plan 

 Fans though these share certificates are likely worthless 

Fernandes   millionaire with assets around  Lakshmi Mital   billionaire and the  richest person  the  There are interesting stories surround BhatiaMittals dealings  QPR with Bernie Ecclestone  Flavio Briatore the  who previously owned the  shares That  whole other post  itself

What are the main characteristics  QPR  the past  years

Early  QPR are one the clubs who first join the Premier league Finishing top London club     season  then sell Les Ferdinand the next season  are relegated

Late  Life  the  tier  English football

End  the early  Life  the  tier  English football  QPR player Ian Holloway  our manager and saviour   short golden era  QPR recent history with several players and  manager who are QPR fans and manage promotion   annual budget   Ian Holloway  later controversially sacked   result   board takeover  Gianni Paladini  who you saw crying  the  year plan Paladini  never liked  QPR fans

Mid Back  the  tier  football The club   and out  financial receivership Fans contribute money collected  plastic buckets  buy  new player who turns out   crap Alleged Italian mafia involvement and pistol whippings  the board room The club  about   into receivership

 Flavio Briatore buys QPR for about  Attempts  tun  into  Boutique club despite  being built next   council housing project estate and there being  room for your legs when you sit down

 the Neil Warnock era Flavio Briatore steps away from the club handing his shares  Ecclestone due  him being suspended from  Amit Bhatia takes charge appoints Warnock Within  months QPR have gone from relegation fodder  Championship league winners putting QPR back  the top league for the first time   years

Summer  Fernandes buys the  stake from Ecclestone having  days left  the transfer window splurging cash like  going out  fashion Warnock  sacked  Jan  Mark Hughes  appointed manager QPR stay   the skin  thier teth  that famous  game against Man City Mark Hughes then goes about spending many millions Fernandes  very very niaive and keeps signing the cheques

 QPR relegated after winning just  games all season amid player turmoil and severe disharmony

Instability
QPR has had  managers  the past  years been  and out  financial receivership had  debt taken from      years and jumped  and out   different leagues The one very important thing QPR needs  stability

 watched the promotion match and also the Four Year Plan documentary and then read  few bits  Wikipedia and some articles  here but  love any recommendations  what  watchread  get some more background  the team history and also  where they stand now financially and play style and strengthsweaknesses  

Some more specific questions

 know  tiny bit about Tony Fernandes because  love Caterham but not much about him   relates  QPR  How hands      read about him feeling like  got burned  bit  agents and contracts  the past and that  plans   about things differently this year  What  the general expectation  how  will  going forward

 read something about potential fines from the Championship over going over budget  Can anyone give   explanation for dummies and also any potential implications going forward

 know very little about Harry Redknapp  his style  Any particular games  watch that would give  good sense  

Any players  particular who form the core  the team  

What  the team looking  add during the transfer window

 don like Taarabt  think  shit and that  was always shit  not talking talent because that really would  stupid but  saying that  not  good teamplayer What  mean  that  that  believe any team that puts  with him will ultimately  weaker for the experience 

 like the kid who wants  watch the game when his team  winning but will turn  off when they are losing  not good enough  act that mental  not Balotelli

You can see   the ways  acted when  was with  and when  did stupid shit like not answering the phone when his national coach came calling for him

 may have been the goalscorer who got   the  the first time round but  think his belief that   destined for bigger things will always  his downfall and  will never achieve those things because  his ego  have always felt this even when  was banging  the goals for 

Secretly  have always wanted   sell him and  the first thing   when ever  play career mode  Fifa 

 know this  not  unpopular  opinion   used   say  years ago but there was  time when  dare not whisper this even  the internet

superhoops,"Thought  should discuss whats going  happen with Remy 

 what  know  that  got  Relegation clause and  Champions League clause 

Relegation Clause  void because  are  the same league now  don have  sell him

With Liverpool backing out that all the Champions league clubs out  the running IMO Chelsea won come for him neither will City and Arsenal don want  spend   week

Next  are Europa league clubs Tottenham Everton and Hull Spurs and Everton may come for him but  won want  sign for Hull Extra money for them believe      worth    books  Ulloa  worth  now

The other clubs not  European competitions have little   chance  signing him Newcastle fans think they are  shoe   get him now but  really don think Fernandes will sell   club that will possibly  fighting relegation with  next season  some points and  actually said  will refuse  sell  them  points last season Further more  Remy playing for   some midtable club  totally irrelevant same amount  games same football Newcastle  historically  big club but right now  just  midtable contender  better than Sunderland  Stoke IMO

  believe  have  good chance  keeping him for  least another season  come January unless  are looking safe  then which  doubt  won see  order  try and keep ourselves out  the relegation battle Obviously Redknapp likes him and Tony likes him

 also still think Remy will  possibly   criminally inconvenient moment

 this worst case scenario all  ask for  that our season  alive until almost the end and  not relegated with    games left  the season

 have pace down the back with  probable formation  Traore  Caulker  Rio  Onuoha  IslaSimpson All  these players quality enough  suffice

Midfield will  weaker with Barton Faurlin and Mutch This  where  would like  see players like Diame Fer   Guzman slotting    can sign either one  these three  well  pen  oneyear deal for Collison   see enough skill  seal   place finish  which  would  more than happy

Our forward line  the other hand   bit sketchy Remy and Austin are class and could possibly  the best pairing  have seen for  while   short QPR following but  need more strikers Bobby  has been performing quite well IMO  has made  real influence  the last  minutes  our past games and should   good sub even  the prem  still think  should have got Stevie May who signed for Sheff Wednesday but  think   signed another striker  the lines   Deeney but not  his price  should  fine

Also  was great  see Faurlin back out there and  not saying  played bad  just think  need  spark  hoilett  create more chances for remy and charlie  think the subs should  zamora and matty   are down  goal and ale and henry  hold  lead 


What  you guys think

",173,2014-08-17
superhoops," think  many predicted Simpson will not work very well  that wingback role and  thought  was risky  the whole even bothering with   all given Isla couldn play although  gather that roadblock wasn finalised until very late  the day  contrast  Simpson  thought Traoré was fine  his position

 other main concern  Remy   obviously talented yesterday but his body language worried   bit  hope  stays until January but  not counting   His footwork  something that Charlie and Bobby don have  doubt Sigthorsson has  and  this stage even with big money  won  able  buy  

Elsewhere  not  stressed  were unlucky  come away with nothing 

 thought the defense were  even with Dunne  was good  see Ferdinand barking out instructions  everyone looking like  meant  any concerns over his signing should  put  bed for now  looks like  brings  touch  that classic Man  dressing room   way that Park couldn

 liked the look  Mutch and  hoping  develops into something special for   was running around with  intensity that Kranjcar Carroll and Ravel didn serve  last year   opinion Faurlin distribution  adequate Maybe Barton needs  roll back his duties  bit and stick  adding bite  the back  midfield

Question    Fer comes  who would  replace from Barton Faurlin and Mutch  might  tempted  pull Barton   honest",277,2014-08-17
superhoops,"Its difficult  say exactly what  need  change   did  well but  just didn end   win But here goes

 don think Dunne  good enough bring  Onuoha

Hopefully Ferdinand mistake will make him inspire him   better   wouldn want  end his career   flop

Simpson for Isla Possibly  least try  out for  few games

Faurlin for Hoilett  like them both  not sure here

 don like Barton taking set pieces  too many just lead  nothing

Austin and Remy looked good but couldn get the ball  the net  perscribe them ccs  training under Hoddle

Caulker Mutch and Traore all were good

Fer   get him definitely can fill  role  don have  the moment  central midfield",143,2014-08-17
superhoops,Either Charlie and Remy can play together  they need  figure out who plays off the shoulder  the last man and who comes short There was  partnership there  all  didn think Mutch had  brilliant game but  improve plus  think  buy  number   was concerned before the game that Faurlin and Barton and  would struggle for pace and physicality but they did well,74,2014-08-17
superhoops," loved Faurlin determination and clear pride  has  the club  far  player you want  your team and  don think  needs   replaced

AgainRichard Dunne The guy   rock and  think  played well despite  preference  Onuoha Would like  see Onuoha play against Spurs   believe they will   bit more pacey and suitable  Onuoha attributes

 may not  the best sub   quite slow  the ball and would rather see  new striker fill his role

Remy  class especially  the first half Austin was  and didn really look confident  that penalty kick Would have given   Barton especially  that moment  the game

The only changes that  would make  Isla for Simpson     good   says    would also swap Dunne for Onuoha Overall  was really happy with the performance  god were  unlucky  score  least two goals but  have  perform  set pieces    becoming ridiculous  said that  played far better than last season  the Championship and  couldn agree more Looking forward  Spurs and ready  post the  there   need   upset picture   Facebook  piss off  brother

superhoops," was thinking about the signing  have made for our  season and   actually really impressed  could  eating  words   months but  believe the board and Harry have made incredible signings 

Defenders Caulker Isla Rio
Midfielders Fer and Mutch
Forwards Remy maybe keeping

 Vargas counting  chickens before they hatched  course comes   have got  strikers

Rio Isla Fer and Vargas all have experience playing  Isla and Vargas already know each other from the national team Both set    loan and need  impress   signed 

Caulker and has played for Harry came   play with Rio Rio came for Harry like Fer After the Liverpool transfer fell through  appears that Harry has been putting his arm around Remy  bring him back into the fold

 looks like  well executed plan  the transfer market  thousand miles away from Hughes bungling just buy whoever good tactics   course  need this  translate into  decent season for  but   really impressed  the moment 

 Vargas signs   expecting probably  attacking midfielder  true number  and another Central midfielder before the end  the transfer window loan  buy probably  least one  them  Spurs player and honestly  couldn have chosen better players myself for   sign  mean

 most  the major positions  have got  least  choices  which  rate both  good

superhoops,"httpwwwredditcomsuperhoopscommentscongratulations_qpr

 thought  drag   thread from  years ago too discuss our summer transfer window Not digging out doeboy  all but you can see how much opinions change and how quickly 

 remember that transfer window well because  remember being   wedding saying   friend Norwich supporter now  our position last season that  had signed too many quality players   down Julio Cesar  Remember when you heard  signed him   was also confident because  what Hughes said  the end  the Man City  QPR game  won   this position again

However  all know how that panned out

  feeling very positive  the start  this season but   honest  was feeling that way  the start  that season What  you guys reckon are  heading for another nightmare Premier League campaign  

  put  negative spin  our signing instead  the positive one

Caulker Mutch and Fer were relegated with their teams Caulker played every game  that season and FerMutch was pretty close  all their games

Ferdinand played  games last season mostly   sub and   years old Quality  still there but  don know  his legs are

Isla and Vargas are totally untested  the Premier League 

 have never played  and when Harry tried too last season  got spanked

Don get  wrong  think  have  lot  potential but there are also worrying signs there that remind   that season  never gave   the team but there were times  was embarrassed    QPR fan Bosingwa for example  that season Seeing Wigan going down swinging and  limping  death   corner

However the major difference IMO  how much the lads seem  like each other this season Steve Black and Hoddle should make the difference ",336,2014-08-22

superhoops,"Just home from the game 

Defensive concerns  have  introduce some competition  defence because something looks off between Rio and Caulker  lot  goals have come from Rio bad marking  why not give Onuoha the chance  shake things   bit Isla too looked  concern today with both goals coming from his side 

Ref Didn get  proper view nor the benefit   replay but  definitely looked like Crouch climbed  Rio for their first goal Ref also let them get away with  unbelievable amount  dirty play  the box Not  mention the amount  timewasting that  didn seem  mind  the slightest Which brings   the next point

Stoke What  bunch  pricks Dirtiest team  seen  Loftus Road Two substitutions used just  injuries Don even need  mention the corner defences  the shirt pulling either Something  seriously wrong with the rules when Shawcross from behind can clatter straight into Kranjcar  the turn and get the same penalty  Fer did when  tried telling Shawcross what what 

Goalscoring Would loved  goal from open play today all three goals off set pieces  not  good sign  gotta say  Austin sort  looks out  his depth His first touch  heavy and  loses the ball  doesn distribute  properly too often  deserves time  adjust  the Prem but  not been  auspicious start  don think Pleased with Vargas offtheball movement though

",262,2014-09-20
superhoops," thought Phillips was shocking for the most part  seemed  settle down  bit  the end but his first touch when receiving  ball coming with any kind  power  woeful  would thought Hoilett would been  wiser choice  compliment the Vargas and Austin partnership The man can cross but when you playing next   poacher and  pace merchant his scrappy balls would sufficed

The midfield was like  gang  strangers for chunks  the first half Misplaced passes and seemingly little instinct and confidence  moving the ball into dangerous positions

 forgive Traoré most things   like his attitude and his workrate  great   flawed though and  gets mugged down his flank  anticipate  lot  facepalm moments with him over the coming months

Let them play seems   the plan  can discern any solid tactical strategy any more  seems   that the one thing  have  abundance  pace and  could use more long balls Too many spells  passing the ball around the box and never finding  decent moment  bank  nice shot  bit  deja  from last season   honest

 think  Charles Austin   square peg   round hole  isn  battering ram  isn  hold man and  isn  footwork wizard      grafterand  not sure   suitable  the tip  the spear  this level  still not sure what  make  Vargas but  think  think   still suffering from lack  matchtime with the rest  the squad

Two questionably fit players had   subbed off  really wish they would take  look  why  keep getting  many soft tissue injuries

 think Onuoha and Yun are getting screwed over  Redknapp

Kranjcar hands down man  the match Superb stuff from him   just needs  keep  consistent One  his passes came flying towards  corner  the ground and time almost slowed down   gazed upon the beautiful spin that characterised the perfect weighting Still would have been nice  have Taarabt  the bench  cover for him   emergency though Hope  recovers soon

Also have  mention  appreciation  Karl Henry Non nonsense player gets  with the job  clockwork defensive midfielder

  was Stoke  would  cursing the string  fouls  the end that gifted  that beautiful goal With  bit  restraint they could taken all three points They had some nasty looking characters among their support  haven heard such focus and passion aimed  Sombrero Man before Then the same characters surprised   generously applauding the tiger cubs  halftime

Onuoha needs    the pitch Ferdinand and Caulker aren good enough  Our defence had little movement and  easily beaten Ferdinand has done nothing  convince   was  good idea  sign him

 the midfield  think  stick with five  Hoilett Kranjcar Barton Fer and Phillips  Kranjcar  dangerous  saw that against Stoke and  think  will continue  see that his fitness alone speaks  his resolve this season   don think  need  justify why Barton deserves  spot  onto Fer  This could really been Mutch  Sandro but  went with Fer because  been  the starting  and has looked good  Phillips makes  appearance  the right wing and  think his pace size strength and crossing ability warrant   Ultimately  brings width  the team and  need that   the left  put  Hoilett and that  the only area  midfield  wasn sure about  Who   have who provides good width  the left wing and can deliver  quality cross   think Hoilett  the guy   nimble and sneaky  well  The problem  that Traore also overlaps  this role being someone who likes  come forward and attack   Traore  more suited  being our guy  the left wing than maybe  switch out Hoilett for Mutch  someone who  better suited  covering left back when Traore goes forward

 front  think  stick with one  Austin  start and Vargas  sub but  have   careful with our strikers  they are  short supply   was  tad worried  see both Vargas and Austin  the pitch against Stoke today because  one goes down  severely hurt our chances going forward     surprise  are light  striker and for that reason  think  can only afford  stick one  front",416,2014-09-20

Preferred formation  sometimes 

  writing Burnley haven scored  goal  more than seven hours  football For  team that  the Championship depended  their goalscoring  goals  most this has    concern Their two prolific strikers from that season  Ings and Vokes  are both currently injured Vokes having missed all season with  serious knee injury and Ings picking   hamstring against Crystal Palace Summersigning Lukas Jutkiewicz  without  goal despite starting every game but has nevertheless played well and  highly rated amongst the Burnley fans Scott Arfield the rightwinger  spite   poor game against Sunderland   real handful and has been Burnley best player  far 

Burnley defence however  looking strong having put  three clean sheets   row Their backline  Trippier Duff Shackell Mee  have played consistently together since    result the back four despite having  stars  household names seem congruent calm and confident They aren what you call modern defenders with adventurous wingers and playing centrebacks but they quite happy  play deep all game  narrow when the opposition attacks and head away crosses all day long This has worked  treat against teams who opt  play with  lot  long balls the home draw  United being the most notable but has been less efficient against teams who like  keep the ball  the ground and play with pace Swansea and Chelsea  

 spite  their inauspicious scoring habits and lack  points Dyche urges calm With two key strikers missing but the defence nevertheless functioning the general mood around Burnley  that  they can remain resilient defensively the points will come once they get some attacking prowess back

Even though Burnley are pretty much universally considered relegation favourites they have made  habit  exceeding expectations Last season their bright start surprised many and they were widely expected   unable  keep  the pace due  the narrowness  their squad But instead they just kept getting stronger and stronger and ended  earning automatic promotion comfortably For that reason  would encourage everyone not  write them off  they may yet become  team that punches above their weight 

However they are currently   crucial stage  their season  they start picking  points now then the awkward start  the season will hardly have mattered but  they don they will soon find themselves  deep water Since Everton and Arsenal are tough games  get points from  the next couple  games which will prove most important West Brom would  their best chance  pick  points  Leicester and West Ham have both looked very strong 

All  all based  what  seen  Burnley  think  probable that they finish their  gameweek with  points

Preferred formation varies widely but lately 

 hard  know where Sunderland are   the Americans say  what exactly  expect from them this year They barely kept  consistent formation were uninspired when  met them  Loftus Road but  home they have picked  impressive draws against Man Utd and Tottenham 

Sunderland big goal  the transfer window was  pick   striker This was meant   Borini but   all know  would rather keep the bench warm  Liverpool choice striker than move   team further down the table 

This has rather landed Sunderland  the soup  they seriously lack firepower  front and Poyet  left scrambling for  system that compensates for their weak strikeforce Against WBA  tried playing Fletcher   lone striker with Connor Wickham supporting from midfield against Utd and   played   with Wickham Fletcher and BuckleyJohnson and  the last two games played Wickham   lone striker 

Wickham starting every game might give the impression that  been playing well But really   more accurate  describe him  the best   bad bunch From what  seen when  has the ball  knows how  lash  but generally speaking   stationary and makes very few runs  look for the ball Big guy but  bit too soft and easy  push around Danny Graham hardly looks convincing either and will most likely  their cupguy Fletcher   little past  not having looked his previous quality   fair while now 

That  mind  think   safe bet that  January Sunderland will seek  strengthen Sunderland are the  highest spending teamhttpwwwfootballobservatorycomIMGpdfwp_engpdf  the last five years  all  Europe  don  surprised  they manage  conjure  another few million  drop   quality player

Until then though Poyet should  grateful  his midfield for picking  the slack Sunderland midfield  usually some combination  Cattermole Larsson Rodwell and Johnson    their biggest strength robust and physical high pass completion rate and retains possession like  midtable team Poyet has always been  safety first kinda guy and just  was the case  Brighton his Sunderland seeks first and foremost   difficult  break down Their forwardgoing threat comes from Johnson pace and Larsson crosses  well  set pieces Van Aanholt the speedy leftwingback has also actually been one  their best offensive assets But with  ineffective striking force  simultaneously alarming and impressive that all five  their goals have come from midfielders 

Having said all that aside from the striker situation this Sunderland team actually looks pretty decent They have two good goalkeepers  Mannone and Pantilimon and  pretty meanlooking defence For that reason  should all keep our fingers crossed that Sunderland have very few points once January rolls around and they get  chance  buy  striker 

However their fixture list currently looks pretty sympathetic having already drawn with Tottenham and Man Utd Their first win  the season probably won come against Arsenal  Southampton but Swansea and Stoke  home  well  Crystal Palace away are points available for the taking Once the  gameweek finishes  expect Sunderland  have between  and  points

superhoops," disappointing defeat but did many   expect  walk away with points

Positives

 The second half saw real fight from QPR
 Charlie Austin has scored   goals   consecutive games
 Kranjkar has been very impressive   consecutive games   think  should take all freekicks that offer  shot  goal
 Ultimately QPR were beaten   wonder goal that few teams could have defended against
  played away against   placed Southampton the best team  met  far this season and only lost 


Negatives

  have serious defensive weaknesses
 Ferdinand looks   guaranteed  first team start  mater what
 Onuoha and SukYoung will  asking questions about their QPR futures
 The  teams around  have games  hand   need  start winning games  soon enough other teams will start breaking away from 
 There still looks    issue with team cohesion  the pitch  games into the season and after  summer training games there  excuse for that


What are your thoughts

 Think that amazing goal from Charlie will give him  boost such  shame about the Pelle goal  minuets later
 Are   become the man utd retiring home Where players like Park and Ferdinand they come here  play shit get talked about how amazing  player they are and just pick   few final pay packets
 Kranjcar was great again very positive from him and  looked like   scored  would  involved  some way
 Green had  very strong  half and also rushed out when  realised Ferdinand had fucked  again

 think there are  lot  positives obviously missing somebody like Barton  the pitch  control the team  bit more and get them going   could 
Play like  did  the  half all games  will   lot more enjoyable  watch and not going they have scored more goals than   better sit back and defend this one and not attack

  were cynical  would get Harry out and try and get Pulis but  can see that happening with Fernandes backing Harry needs  have  fully formed plan going into games rather than the  players who seemed   alright last week and the players need  start showing they want   there

Even  you are committed  the job  and  point  your comments about retirement and golf  what  you understand the job   especially beyond throwing out  men every weekend and ringing around your old agent mates each transfer window  reference the point made  the last podcast  Pulis  the end  last season stalking the club facilities pointing out which minutiae  wanted changed  Redknapp  doing the same  Modibo Maiga pizza delivery guy

  not Newcastle manager Alan Pardew with one game  save his job   Perhaps people don have anything better  write about

WellPardew has  long contract that will  expensive  buy out And QPR supporters are generally pretty invested  terms  time and money  supporting the club  sure they could write about better things  the forums and Twitter What your favourite KFC Krushem but the online reaction isn exactly whimsical tiptapping  the keyboard   Sunday afternoon

 had  interest  signing one either  said  Tony Fernandes that   stay  the Premier League then let sit down and have  discussion wouldn have any interest managing  the Championship

Again with his conditions Some might interpret this  him only staying   swerves failure Othersthat  will only bother waking     drive      Premier League club

Fer Sandro and Henry were class against Liverpool Really bossed the midfield  least  the first half  the second  subbed off Onuoha due  injury and changed   That was when Liverpool started taking over For some reason this team doesn seem   very good    think  saw that today  well Fer Sandro and Henry could hardly complete   yard pass  the first half And Fer does not belong  the left Kept drifting inwards towards the centre  midfield and left acres  space behind him which  exploited again and again Another reason  were lucky today because  better team would made  pay for that However once  brought Hoilett  and went  and let Fer play through the middle suddenly  were bossing  other words  need  persist with the  experiment  soon  Onuoha comes back

 also want  point out that this game was like the inverse  how QPR games  far this season have tended  play out Usually our midfield  pretty good but our defence leaks  goal  two our strikers are inefficient waste  few chances and  end  losing     something But today  spite  misplaced passes  midfield our attack was clinical and our defence was watertight That good enough against Villa but   going  get anything against Chelsea and City  need everything working",370,2014-10-27

Personally speaking  funny how fragile all that positivity was that  snowballed from that  game window Palace victory put  very different perspective  the Liverpool game and  was really hoping that the polish from the other games would produce something  Saturday Our next two away games will likely  just  difficult  Swansea and Everton

Green had  decent game  strange feeling  confident with him  goal and seeing him  confident  the back Caulker was the better  the two CBs but again  more clinical team would have punished  for those mistakes Isla was great again for 

Really impressed with Krancjar and Fer  played the game with  much intensity that  were always taking  risk with the result but  feels  good  have chalked  another  points Let hope the boys   Swansea with some confidence  can take something from there",177,2014-11-29

With all due respect  Leicester they looked like  good quality Championship side with little individual skill relying  the counterattack and our very poor defence but they are  team  have  beat  stand  chance  staying  this league

Excellent energy levels from QPR players and great  see  very attacking team not something  been used  for many years   shots yesterday   target  and that was without 

Traoré Not someone  see play very often  another player that needs games Sitting   block  had  close view  his performance His ability  put   cross  quite amazing  puts  crosses crosses from seemingly nothing   squeezed into the sideline with  space  think his crossing ability should  used more often

 The away mindset has got   that this  the premier league and  any given weekend  can take points from anybody 

 think Zamora will help   have  little possession  the final third but  expect    defending for most  the night

That said  have  break this tradition  losing away  some point and  can leave  too late  the day  need   far more willing  enter into  firefight rather than invite pressure against the likes  Swansea For the most part  think the squad largely lack the finesse  operate entirely effectively  the counter    real ballache because you imagine that Traoré Phillips and Hoilett are perfect for that but  think each  them  technically unreliable for either holding    the end   runwaiting for the others  scramble into play  for finding that one touch shot  find the back  the net That being the case  will need  scheme our way  the field  failing that use blunt force  Henry Barton and Fer centrally for god sake swapping  Mutch should  capable  this

 hard not  look back  those dropped points against Hull and Liverpool with regret but  really moved  since then Another great performance again today not entirely convincing but solid enough had Green  thank for  great first half save but even  spite  his great shot stopping  still makes   nervous when  got the ball because  his proneness  errors  cleared  ball straight  Boyd   the first half and almost gave Burnley the lead when  came  collect  cross

superhoops," all know how important our run  around Christmas  but what about those around 

Hull

After their cup heroics  was surprised  see them enter the relegation zone but  have looked  their performances only  wins this season which  quite bad for this time  the season  unfortunate that sports media seems  have  narrative they like  see and  why IMO Hull haven even been mentioned  relegation contenders  outlets like MOTD

Hull have got  difficult run  Chelsea  lose IMO Swansea  lose IMO Sunderland   either way amp Leicester  either way They could come into January with not much more points than they have now

 prediction  points from the next  games

Sunderland

  decent position they have West Ham   lose IMO Newcastle    Lose     Debry and Newcastle are  home then Hull either way  and Villa either way   would think with Gus they should  okay They have  relegation sixpointers  their own but   was  betting man  would  for Sunderland 

 prediction  points from the next  games

Crystal Palace

Looking   like the strongest out  the bunch Stoke  either way Man City  lost Southampton  lose IMO QPR  QPR win IMO Hard games all but they surprised everyone last year Warnock has been doing okay  far but apart from the Liverpool game nothing special

 Prediction  points from the next  games

West Bromwich Albion

Another Team  surprised  see around  Villa  either way QPR  hopefully QPR Man City  lost Stoke  either way Hard  predict them  lot rides  what happens when  play them  think Will decide whether they just romp  through    get caught   the battle

 prediction  points from the next  games

Leicester City

Very hard Christmas coming into these games without  win since September which  why  was  important that  beat them  wouldn like the look  any  these games Man City  lose West Ham  lose Tottenham  lose IMO Hull  either way  Leicester aren careful they could  cut adrift from the rest  the league  January

 prediction  point from the next  games

Burnley

Now that   Christmas run  you don want Southampton  lose Tottenham  lose Liverpool lose Man City  lose
Burnley are the draw masters  the league  far but  can imagine them picking  point from these teams Southampton will  looking for  win after last week Maybe  out  form Tottenham but  think Palace was  blip Liverpool  way and City Like Leicester they have got  run  that frighten any manager  stopped   game undefeated run that might have got them through  January with their heads held high but  can see where they will  getting points from now

 prediction  points from the next  games

Queens Park Rangers

Everton  probably lose West Brom  either way Arsenal  probably lose Crystal Palace  either way From  perspective  can see  getting something from those away games maybe  point Everton have got  after  midweek Europa league game and Arsenal aren  sparkling form  the moment Hopefully  can avoid losing both  those home games but our luck will run out somewhere  may lose one  them

 prediction  points from the next  games Which would leave    coming into the next year Which would   okay position


Comments

  interesting  see that Leicester and Burnley have such tough run ins   can avoid losing  West Brom and Palace then things might  looking nice  January  don imagine many  the teams around  barring  good run  form will  coming out  Christmas with more than  points

That being said  can see  maintaining our home form  January without even the slightest blip not matter how many virgins  sacrifice Rob Green can keep  saving the day like his alterego  Clark Kent This  why our away form frustrates   much With  few away draws  would  several places above now and   completely different mindset

There are  few other teams that could join this group Even reaching  far   place Aston Villa  can see what Harry meant  Homeform being vital this Christmas

 would put serious money  Vargas scoring more goals than Keane Vargas  well settled into the club and has scored when played  front for QPR and scores plenty  goals for his national side  that position

Another option would   acquire  decent rightback allowing Isla  play  his natural rightwing position then allowing Vargas  play front that way you have two quality young players who have  natural pairing playing  their naturally strongest positions   this   logical and natural thing    bet Harry will  all  his power  prevent  from happening until  has  choice

superhoops,"What  win Can help but look back  that time  came back  beat Liverpool  and turn our season around  don enjoy going behind  often and giving teams this many chances but  play with such  intensity and togetherness that  makes games    absolute joy  watch Some  the most exciting games  the season have been played there  feels like  average result  proud  our attitude  come back and win Great team spirit

Agree with your point about Hill   different respects him and Kranjcar are superb  slowing the game down Kranjcar provides the cool head  need  close the game down his importance  really understated while Hill makes himself known with his aggression  battling  was nice  see him back  the team

Henry wasn  his best but  let that slide  been really impressed  the way  worked his way into the team Not his best performance but certainly not  bad one Barton was fantastic  slowly getting back  his best since his injury Vargas was unimpressive for  again  needs  remind  what  capable  

 the back  felt like roles were reversed  day Onuoha was solid but Dunne and Caulker were all over the place  times Berahino almost punished   the end there  was shocked  see   down   home There will come  time when teams will hang onto their leads after going ahead here  managed  get the  points against Leicester and WBA but maybe next time  won   lucky Not their best days

Charlie Austin  what  there that needs saying Give that man  contract",305,2014-12-20
superhoops,"This  the kind  game where  Charlie were suspended here instead  against Everton  his shoulder had gone  have lost  and  all  saying  god  just like last time Instead   place more goals scored than Liverpool and  finally reached the  gamespoints ratio 

The referee may have fucked  today but  had our fair share  good fortune  the balance  the chances they were arguably slightly better  thought Our defending was  bad that those two goals could just  well have been own goals But when  kicked off   down  saw the players hyping each other  and fistpumping   come  fashion Even  down  have the spirit  home  keep fighting Old QPR would just given  

The Vargas substitution for Hoilett irritated  Vargas was ineffective  the first half but  the game opened   the second  started finding space and running  his defender Then Harry subbed him off  the worst possible time Meanwhile Fer wad having  pretty poor game but was allowed  continue for the full  minutes  really should been Fer for Hoilett imo That way  would had the pace threat  both flanks

Aside from that  like  whinge   few more things such  the sloppy passes  midfield and the complete absence  the right winger and defender  the first half  think  goes  show how essential starting Isla and Vargas together  since that flank  usually one  our biggest threats but today both Vargas and Onuoha looked rather clueless 

 course  delighted with the points but  weren  good  the scoreline shows  have Charlie and the Loftus Road factor  thank for  lot  that can get  points against Swansea and Palace and  can mend some gaps  the squad  January  someone  share Charlie goal scoring duties and another right back   really really think  going  stay

 don know   agree with the Fer assessment  this game  thought  was poor when  were chasing the game but great for holding the ball  when  were  this could also have   with the fact that  was moved into  central role which suits him  lot more than the left wing role 

These are the kinds  games that   need  win  stay   points  the return fixture would also  great

 also think that Zamora was fantastic  the game  terms  being  nuisance  were also missing Isla  times his link  with Vargas   lot better than Neddie 

The ref also had  really strange game  was calling everything  the start and  the first half than had  minutes  the second where  let the game flow  was weird

The entire team needs  work  Charlie   work People need   pumping  balls into the box delivering something  his feet  head But  one did There were  real chances created  such   the entire game 

Barton was poor Fer was worse But worst  all was Zamora who won precisely nothing all game long  need  start transitioning away from the hoof   Bobby strategy  think  not exactly  recipe for long term success 

And therein the problem with Harry  just doesn have the tactical mind  make that kind   change  played his beloved  with two strikers and two wingers who can run  their defenders and the rest  them can just fackin run around  bit The problem  that Hoilett and Philips just aren good enough And  have  plan

superhoops,"This guy   poster  LFW who apparently works for  and  beloved  some there for his analysis  think this post  worthy  being repeated httpwwwfansnetworkfootballqueensparkrangersforumriowoefulperformancetoday here

Part  the problem  that playing  high intensity and pressing game especially against technically superior teams  always hard work  difficult for sides who are  tiptop physical shape  maintain that for the entire  minutes let alone  side like ours which doesn have the best fitness record  work ethic 

 that work ethic and desire  work hard that the obvious problem  has improved but  still not been enough yet There were plenty  occasions even when  were doing well where  was yelling from the stands about the lack  speed they took  get back into shape for any turnover  possession This affects everything and Spurs and Arsenal Spurs particularly had great depth and shape  their play  you not  the right position  all times then you going  make life difficult for yourself and  the moment you switch off you punished 

The defence and attack are simply not always resetting their positions quickly enough which means they further apart from the next nearest unit and which means  play breaks down  requires support they not  the right place  help sustain attacks  deal with impending danger 

Take Spurs second goal for example where  had Mauricio Isla play  silly ball down the line that  didn need  make and wasted possession Charlie Austin chased after  and was irritated  the ball but then Austin decided  chase after  anyway when  was gone already and came well out  position  looked dejected and annoyed slowed down then moaned rightly   Isla for making such  impatient pass Spurs took the ball played  back inside where Austin should have been but now  was out  play and  signalled  Bobby Zamora and complained  Zamora that  wasn filling  when  should and suddenly they were out  the game Spurs had plenty  time  the ball 

The rest  the units behind paused not sure whether  sit and hold  press without those two  the picture and before you knew  Ryan Mason was wondering around unopposed and picked out  easy ball over the top because the defence were now not  the right place either And   goal and game over 

Little details make  big difference You can afford  switch off for  moment and you got   prepared  work hard for every single minute  every single game  they  that they improve and see results improve  they don then   much   muchness and  reliant  people taking their chances when they come",493,2015-03-08

 would like  see Caulker and Fer loaned out but  don think that should  necessary unless  miraculously  straight back   terms  the subs  don know enough about our youth   too decisive  think  should try  offload Hoilett just because  find him  bit   waste  space Honestly  think this would   pretty decent starting  especially  the  player  pick  from the Eredevisie  decent 

Should  another interesting year for superhoops

Edit    bit   pain  the arse   foreign fan  support  team  the Championship but   means more attractive exciting football count   Should   better year than with  especially without the Maiga Doyle Hughes and Kranjcar buys",239,2015-03-15
superhoops,"Here  overview  most  the contract situatiuonhttpwwwindyrsmessageboardviewtopicphp One  the biggest headaches  see actually comes from two players who have flown under the radar  the wake  more outrageous player contractperformance ratios  Onuoha and Hoilett They both signed   time when contracts were very generous indeed and they both  collecting  these for another year  this impending future  severe cutbacks these two will probably  collecting the equivalent salaries   players each

There are  couple  stupid deals which will  even more eyewatering  the brave new world  Taarabt Caulker Sandro and Fer  can imagine the latter three might  saleable but the day might arrive when  let Taarabt    free fuck you Levy and your  sell  clause  lamentably loan him back  Italy while subsidising his very steep salary

 this point  think Yun has done enough wrong  well  right  throw off any suitors  might  facing  logjam with Robinson coming back though  have  idea what Robinson playing style  Given that  almost certainly  lumbered with Onuoha they   out and pick   fresh leader  the back They need someone vocal and authoritative  compliment the other three  this stage  don think Dunne can stay functional for long enough  this stage Ehmer should  making  the numbers

Hopefully Phillips stays  spend the entirety  the Summer training sessions converting Traoré into  leftwinger  keep Henry for the middle but  have  doubts about him being the charismatic leader  bark  people from the midfield Not sure what you  about Barton one will offer him wages close  anything like  getting right now  just had  house built  Richmond has  lot  media activities and  doing his degree  probably  down for hanging around locally  there might   deal   had  largely depends  who the manager will  though  with Barton you always   the lookout for  personality clash Doughty and maybe Manning can make  the numbers  would  nice  have Faurlin back for another season but  don think the club    position   rolling out pity contracts any more   would have   for  Faurlin who can contribute

Third season  the trot that    urgent need  extra firepower

 think   Championship club  lose leverage  attracting players from abroad Depending  who comes   might  leaning  old relationships for  lot  loans  just hope they source the right ones this time",470,2015-03-15

 Get Vargas back    depending   have  better option than Phillips    Also chemistry between Isla and Vargas  the right adds more quality  that side than Isla and Phillips   have  idea  Vargas  injured  not but  has been unjustly removed from the starting 
 Phillips  less effective   than  but  has been working  far and his defensive cover has helped Yun  Our only other options   are Hoilett and Traore who have not been particularly effective
 Replace Henry with Barton  sure this was bound  happen anyway but will improve the quality  the midfield
 Get Taarabt off the pitch leave  Zamora and Austin  front   least  know the type  performance  will get out  Zamora less  with Taarabt  don care   can change  game

superhoops," occasionally have some access  information from inside the QPR camp This info  from  conversation after the Palace game

Confidence

Player confidence    extreme low   least one first  player questions whether they are   the standard required  the   keep getting overrun   phrase that used

Factions remain  the camp

There are  group  approximately  players who  not train with the bulk  the team  not adhere  the main training regime This group includes   the usual suspects and some  our most experienced stalwarts who feel they know better The likes  SWP and Taarabt are laws unto themselves

TrainingCoaching methods

This was highlighted  the most important factor  our under performance  have inherited Harry training approach which has changed little  style since the 
 you look  the likes  Mourhino and other elite team managers and their coaching staff they make notes during  games  they are writing down player names and the minute  the game that player makes  mistake They then use that information  coach the mistake out  the player Allegedly modern techniques like this are not used  QPR and haven been  least since Harry started with  

 have the same coaching staff  under Harry senior players are having trouble respecting the training techniques being used The brief honeymoon period under Ramsey  long over

The  writeoff

 not expected the  will allow that money   written off meaning  are likely  see lengthy legal proceedings between QPR and the  should   down this season

Conclusion

Perhaps none  this tells  anything  didn already know What did make  impression    the very low selfconfidence  the team their apparent acceptance that  are relegated and the overriding dissatisfaction with the way things are being done  QPR    not felt  are  viable Premier League club

  should  noted that this was feedback  Saturday evening after  been thumped  Palace

 always been  big fan  Tony Fernandes but  starting  dawn   that   the problem with QPR  love the guy  really  but his naivety and financial mishaps have been damaging  either backs his manager blindly  gives into rash decisions IMHO the only way  going  move forward  much   pains   say  when  leaves which  have  strange feeling will  sooner rather than later

The only way  could have stayed  was  Tony backed Harry  the transfer window You might argue that Harry signed  few duds but  also made some great signings for   well The Zarate thing has really summed  our season    mess

 far  our lineup goes  Yun  not available Clint Hill will likely feature  left back  Hill puts   shift and covers well   but against top opposition like Chelsea  afraid  could struggle   really need  get Yun back  The next question  whether Dunne makes  immediate return  the starting    don think Caulker has done enough wrong  lose his starting spot and  also believe that Chelsea would find  way  exploit two  defenders   the right side Isla   obvious lock  Isla  competent  right back but against top opposition   saw with Lukaku  will get exploited  Everytime  talk about the right back position all  can think about  why did  sell Danny Simpson

 the midfield Sandro Barton and Phillips are obvious  Our only concern  left midfielder   say  start Traoré   has proven defensive qualities  well  pace and proved  nuisance against Villa  Both Kranjcar and Hoilett have started the position but neither have made  their own    quite late  the season   giving out opportunities  any position but  Traoré can    run  good form and transform our left wing the same way Phillips has the right then  all means give him the opportunity

Sunderland  Southampton and Everton think they lose both

Leicester  Chelsea and Newcastle with  game  hand  see them beating Newcastle but not Chelsea

Burnley  Hull and West Ham  see them winning both

 don think  can  hit with  embargo  top   fine thankfully  even such  thing were  happen they have  bend the rules  allow   actually build  team

Acquiring players for salaries  per week

First things first  they need  act quick  settle their new managerhead coach into the position That man then needs  sit down with Ferdinand and come  with  plan  and  plan  and then hit the market and buy accordingly  wouldn  going for  premium striker purchase like Fulham made with McCormack   looking  bring   second striker from  Championship club and pitch him  deal  the number one choice  top  probably set aside  larger chunk  the transfer kitty for this  look  buysign the rest  from anywhere from League One  the Scottish Championship

The next larger transfer fee  set aside  for  captain Probably  central defender  holding midfielder None  the retained players will    the job   seen that they just aren talkers Someone needs   barking out orders  the defense  midfield

For the rest  imagining  lot  cheapish unattached players signing

Competing  the Championship against clubs that are executing welldeveloped longterm plans

This  why  don think   competing for any honours next year This year Championship was intense stuff with the top  teams playing for something down  the wire  top  that Burnley are going down with loads  money Even Wolves are still due  final parachute payment Then you bumping  against the simple fact that most  the teams are bigger than

superhoops,"Yesterday the board issued  statement committing  the club for the short medium and longterm 

 been considering our situation The following summarises  thoughts

Positives

 Likely revenue from selling players this summer 
 Parachute payments  over   years
  are about  lose several high salary players  Barton SWP
 Les Ferdinand   football person and   likely have  more appropriate plan from now 
   are  have  new focus  youth Ramsey  ideal   remains  team coach

Negatives

  are about  lose most  our first eleven
 The perception  QPR inside football has been seriously damaged over the past  years
 Loftus road generates low gate revenues
  likely still have some highsalary players  Onuoha Hoilett Caulker Taarabt Traoré and Sandro
 The club does not have  developed scouting network
 Many  our best youth players left the club due   lack  first team opportunities and mismanagement  the youth academy 
 The club  over   debt
  may face   fine from the 
  may face  transfer embargo from the 

Our main challenges

 Acquiring players for salaries  per week
 Enticing players away from other offers  take  risk  QPR despite our reputation
 Competing  the Championship against clubs that are executing welldeveloped longterm plans
 Staying  the Championship    not too pessimistic  anticipate League  football  the  season

  wise  prepare ourselves  fans for  few seasons  rebuilding  QPR  are almost starting with  blank slate albeit with  extreme level  debt  will need the board ongoing commitment while hoping their business interests continue   well

 reasonably satisfied  what  seen  far and there plenty   encouraged about 

Here why 

 the small details that matter not the overall performances  results Yes there will  some problems that need addressing  but that normal 

You have  first look  the football you see before you consider the performance and results  the personnel and then you have  get  idea about the personnel and how they will come together  form  core nucleus  players that make  the starting squad 

 watched  couple  matches   stream and have been  see  play against Dundee United and Newport County 

 only interested  the small details   focus  those because these are the things that give you the clues  what going  behind the scenes 

Let take Tjarron Chery   example  took  freekick  the firsthalf against Newport  poor one that struck the wall and then  were suddenly being hit  the counter attack 

The freekick was  the right  the penalty box but the resulting play materialised quickly down our left side with Darnell Furlong and Jay EmmanuelThomas nowhere   seen  our right  they were lagging behind having been  far forward for the freekick 

Chery sprinted quietly back into position and filled  for them  took responsibility for team shape and waited until the danger averted and cover arrived before heading back into position 

How often could you say that last season when  came  the likes  Junior Hoilett  Leroy Fer for example Even some  our central midfield players wouldn have done that for the team 

That just one  many small examples  seen from things  worked  

Against Newport the deepest lying central midfielder often dropped back  top  his centreback when the opposition had the ball creating  sandwich between them and the opposing striker and freeing  the other central defender  sweep  behind  necessary  pick  someone else who might  lurking That  something  haven seen Rangers  for years 

 seen much better build  play from the back and more intelligent passing into corridors  space that they clearly worked  Against Dundee United  saw Nedum Onouha make far better passes than  actually really ever seen him play  wasn  the ball nervously waving his hands around jazz hands style like  can   simply knew what runs were going   made and where  slot his pass 

Across the last two matches  seen balls sprayed into wide areas intelligent switches and passages  play designed  encourage the fullbacks  attack and overlap and provide additional support  attacks 

 got into great positions out wide and have clearly worked  trying  put balls into the box with players supporting quickly from behind  the other flank  get into the penalty area Sure the quality  delivery isn quite there yet but the potential most certainly  

But more importantly Whenever the play has broken down  worked hard  get back into shape and pick   the event  being hit  the counter The legs and pace  the team have allowed     lot more dynamic  our response  defence and attack 

Yes  have weaknesses And the set  has provided  much clearer separation  this point between roles and who  supposed   what  defence and attack therefore there are occasions where  asking particular units  deal with particular scenarios Some  that  done well with and some  that  haven however  also not played our strongest side  these games  you have  balance both the good and bad elements  your mind with what  looks like and will  like when the best team  available 

 like that  looked fast and incisive  the counter attack ourselves with several occasions where  moved  the pitch quickly after winning the ball 

 also worked  some passages  play that allow the reverse through ball   played  runners from deep   saw with Matt Phillips goal against Dundee  well  numerous nearly there opportunities across both games and again the pace and legs  the side allow   play this way now   not something  could have done with just Bobby Zamora  Charlie Austin leading the line 

 worked  picking  the ball from deep and playing  around comfortably  the back but  open our lines  attack and not just willy nilly kicking the ball  field which   huge bonus  they can maintain that going forward especially  they don dally around there too long 

The triangle  midfield was nicely set  and positioned across both games  wasn two sitting deep with one  front  was more   rotated triangle with one deep  protect the defence one further forward  the right and one even further forward  apply pressure  opposing players  the ball The balance  this triangle makes for good pressing  zones but also really good options  pass and move the ball quickly 

 there are lots  positives 

Yes  could have looked  little sharper  front  goal  these games yes   need some additional players particularly  defensive areas but with what they trying    there things there that will hopefully fall into place either way 

There are always going   concerns and unknowns particularly with  new team  wasn impressed for example with how EmmanuelThomas berated the kids all the time when they didn  something  wanted from them   the level  wanted  lacked  bit  sensitive encouragement but that might have just been one game  doesn make  terrible and the kids  need  learn 

The second half the match petered out but  had  lot  youngsters  the pitch and some  their play was youthful 

Across the two matches  far  say Massimo Luongo  crucial  the way  want  maintain possession and attack   tried him  two different roles across both games  which again  sensible  see how that works and when  went off Alejandro Faurlin didn quite have the same style  range  passing  wasn  effective",1188,2015-07-27

Chery  the gift that PaladiniSterling bestowed upon  there some beautiful technique and deadball competence  mentioned above

 much  Ramsey  the focus  the article  feel like the constraints that  working under are more important  our current situation than simply the manager and  change  culture Les Ferdinand  his role  DoF has been key  arranging transfers which has limited what Ramsey can and cannot  who  can sign etc   nice change  pace from bringing  Redknapp and Hughes style signings  throw money  players and hope they get the job done but you can tell that  inexperienced  this style  working  Fer Austin and Phillips are still  our books the latter two with only  year left  their deals     disadvantage when  comes  dealing with other clubs  top  all off  also   poor situation vis  vis GKs  like Green  been  model pro but  not  long term option and losing McCarthy was  kick  the teeth 

 also assuming Hoos new CEO has some input over the transfers and running  the club and was brought   help shore  our finances  have  idea what  been doing behind the scenes but that   additional contraint that  assume Ramsey has  work under Maybe  had   something with  bringing    coach last week The same here could also  said about our new chairman the money man and  moving back from the hands  running  the club though maybe  works more long term again  can really say

Finally  have the hangover  last season and another shitty preseaon  think the lapses  Charlton are exactly the same kinds  issues that dogged  last season fatigue lack  concentration and again  shitty preseason Quite  few local journos and even the author  the piece write about consolidation but what does that mean Beyond that surely the club should have arranged  better preseason  think  means that  about  month behind  terms  preparations than where  should  and  shows Clive mentioned   the GBBO podcast from last week that  doesn see  getting many  any points from our first three games and that   danger  coming true  how long until our fans turn  him

superhoops,"

Couple  random things from mobile Think  think about starting Doughty over Henry Seems  touch more versatile However Henry  still  senior figure   think   automatic for  few games yet Maybe better option when holding onto  lead  the end When Sandro comes back though   his Internacional training has kept him match fit  methinks  takes that spot Ephraim was waxing lyrical about Faurlin yesterday  start him against Carlisle and see   still safe for  longer stretch Really like Polter  battering ram Onuoha scampering off onto the attack and weighting the ball  Phillips was  highlight Overall pleased with him but  can see  few mistakes  him over the stretch Gladwin looks more promising than Hoilett but early days Luongo   battler  really good  have him  well Chery gets the ball down  his feat beautifully  the whole  was pretty entertained with that final scene with JETS miss and the equaliser playing out particularly humorously   area

One thing  noticed was that the lower school end was pretty empty  were swathes   block Maybe the new regime isn practicing the same seatstuffing tactics The attendance was just below  ",217,2015-08-16
superhoops, also argue that Ramsey pulled the trigger too early and took off Chery and Austin  order  close  out Our CMs didn provide enough cover and didn hold the ball  enough  gave the initiative totally  Cardiff ,42,2015-08-16
superhoops," think this game  worthy   postmatch thread given its exposure  Sky  well   being  interesting game overall


Lets start with the line

Greeno

Did well when rushing forward  put pressure  Cardiff although clearly handling the ball outside his box However  have  consider the fact that  are likely  lose possession whenever there   pass back   goal kick Bit ridiculous given his experience Honestly thinking that  will  alright   cash him  for the likes  Bentley  Smithies

Konchesky

Slow Did his job and dove into tackles  did make Noone look faster than Usain Bolt but nonetheless  had composure and did his job

Onuoha

Had  great game   opinion  provided the only pace   really slow backline His last ditch tackle later  the game prevented  from losing and  utilised his strength when one  one just before the half

Hill

MOTM   were  have won and frankly  probably   was the man responsible for conceding the first goal but  did score and assist using his fine left arm  noticed that  was the only player  the pitch that  could hear   out  both teams True leader

Perch

Did well  some areas and got ripped  some instances for pace  does seem that  have been exploited down our right side from the last two games   Phillips may   blame

Gladwin

Great potential and gives  Quite nimble for his stature and   arial threat that  need

Luongo

 Australian bias   full force   great  runs and runs whilst providing supply and opening the game  Both  and Gladwin were great signings

Henry

 would rather see Faurlin next week instead  just lacks  bit  life and vibrancy although that isn necessarily needed when you sit just  front  the back four Faurlin should  able  open the game  from deep without slinging those long balls  PolterAustin

Phillips

Was  glimpses the player that  worth   really needs  sort out his confidence  taking  the halfbacks Can create the cross that will win  games

Chery

How the hell did  keep the ball when  was lobbed  him just before  after half time  whipped  three  four crosses right into the danger zone Hopefully with time  will see Polter sitting there  pick them off Decent game although   lacking match fitness

Austin

Lacked fitness and obviously isn  lone striker Did well  get some shots off and could have ended  with  brace

Polter

Doesn have great dribbling  all    work horse though getting intercepts and setting  other player onto goal Time will help him but   quite optimistic

Doughty

Did well Quite composed given his lack  playing time Good player  have  the bench  the moment His time will come when  breaks into the starting 

JET

Seems like another confidence player Doesn mind  shot  goal and  has flair when need  Another decent substitute  have

Cardiff have some decent players Noone Whittingham Jones and  couple others are threatening  think Jones was pivotal  the second half  really good replacement for Zamora   were  have kept the same tactics

Overall  fair result  were extremely lucky and somewhat unfortunate  much needed improvement from last week  need    Keeper and frankly another striker ASAP ",625,2015-08-16

Now more than ever  need  get back    don  think  consign ourselves  another    years  the lower leagues with all the players who will potentially leave  the summer 

And let not kid ourselves    get back   won come down  whether Onuoha has stepped   whether our midfielders are working well together  going  come down  whether  can keep Austin fit and firing all season long  cannot  understated how important  will  and losing him  largely why  think   stuck  the championship for  few seasons

The exciting part  that  now finally have the platform  which  build something that the club has been lacking for the past few years  had  drop down  league    but now  can construct something consistent lasting and strong  been  soft landing into the Championship and  looks like   our way  balancing the books  got  core  players who can together  worth more than the sum  their individual values The foundations are set

Our defending both   team and the back four  now  crisis point

 think this starts  the base  midfield  not sure what the deal  with Henry right now Why did  take  long  sign the extension Why   not putting  the pretty reliable clockwork performances  saw for  good chunk  the start  last year Either way from where  stand    weak link and either Doughty  Sandro should  considered  replace him who presumably have more talentmore desire respectively Given Fer return who  paper should reprise the   spot Luongo might  worthy  consideration  help sit  the back   seems tenacious and looks  have  touch  the boxbox about him  any case  think time should  called  the FaurlinHenry partnership

 still suspect   seen others mention that Hall should have been given  bit more time  seems  doomed  lack  Bartonesque captain   would  least  nice  have youthful hunger and urgency

Phillipsslowly seemingly heading back  his preRamsey days  did try last night but nothing came off

Either the chips are down everyone rallies behind the coach  takes  long hard look  his methods and tactics and team selections the same poor form continues Hull apart and Ramsey will start  hear his name being chanted

One  the things that really stands out for   Saturday  that only   the  starters were new this season  mentioned elsewhere   the supposed superstars were  the pitch  kickoff They failed  home against  newly promoted team  wonder they were relegated Watching   couldn help but think that this was  team essentially welded together with money not team spirit

 imagine Perch will  straight back   the end  the day  think playing   position like full back involves  lot  instinct developed through extensive training and match time with the touchline  one side  getaway driver speeding away from  bankraids  London would probably not   effective  the    was  Paris with the flipped steering wheel and road orientation

 think Chery  the left and Luongo through the middle   legit option and  was  bit dismayed  see this dropped  Saturday  really would have liked  have watched  Gladwin  Luongo  Chery trio playing behind JET and had they offloaded the Holy Trinity  think  might have been treated    guess Chery would  more suited   central role but despite his tendency  disappear from matches  think  shown occasional glances  brilliance such  the Bolton strike

 with you  Hoilett Can ever imagine him  more than  impact sub  looked   Saturday but nothing new there  always flatters  deceive Still  few months  prove  wrong  guess   does need some handholding Warnock might  the man   

Sandro  Redknapp last laugh  still think Tozser might come good  rotation with Faurlin Short  dropping Luongo back  not sure who you partner them with though  think Fer   little one dimensional but maybe  still working his way back  fitness

But   point   really want promotion this season  for one would rather take another season  the Championship rather than yet another Premier League relegation after yet another abysmal season packed full  bad signings and unlucky losses  think goal   for now   reach stability

Junior Hoilett Armand Traoré Samba Diakité Rob Green getting old big wage and has been shaky these last couple  months and Karl Henry all have contracts expiring  the end  the season Getting those offloaded would   massive weight off all  our shoulders Would also like  see Leroy Fer find his way out Going from the World Cup and Premier League  the Championship  just can find any motivation Not  all worth his wage would rather see young talents such  Luongo and Gladwin get those chances young hungry players fighting their nuts off

Now  know what you saying not achieving promotion will certainly see the end  Austin and Phillips QPR careers Yes  probably will but  still adament stability should  our   target now  MATTER WHAT Fernandes keeps saying  learnt but has  really Had  been  the Premier League  the  season with the same wage  would been   the wagetable Though this season and last seasons numbers haven been released  not expecting them   massively reduced  bit probably

Smithies have been dead awful  the few chances  got  conceded  goals for the  Greeno nearing the end  his career probably has  couple  years left though just look  Jussi Jääskeläinen  whatever and Shay Given Would love  see Dan Bentley enter the doors  Loftus Road massive talent and reportedly  bit upset  wasn allowed  Southend United  join QPR  the summer

Other than that  looks like  got ourselves  robust midfield pair  Faurlin and Sandro Gotta love Faurlin and Sandro   proper warrior Grant Hall started the season shaky but man  really grown into his role Looks solid and consistent Though  like Onuoha you just can rely   all times  feel James Perch  rubbish makes too many mistakes and never really makes  for any   with like  brilliant assistgoal    minute goalline clearance when    away from home

Like many here   not understand the lineups over the last  games    Regarding JFH  seems like   using all the players  has  get  feel for who goes and who stays  the long term  

  the biggest mistake this season was not selling Austin  Just poor asset management  Buy low and sell high and the club screwed that   Now you sell him for peanuts maybe make some money off the transfer based  what they paid for him  worse yet  leaves for nothing  the end  the season

superhoops," kind  perceive this   three pronged issue

Firstly the most obvious issue  the performances themselves Season after season now  seeing similar issues  overreliance  one man getting goals poor patterns  play with little clever instances  moving the ball forward  stubborn refusal  cross the ball and  infuriating knack for conceding late goals  top  all this the club  constantly seems  fall back into this position  playing their most seasoned highly paid players even when they don seem  form  effective cohesive unit Yesterday underlined all  these points Regardless  the point gained  was   poorhonestly one  the worst performances  can remember  not sure  what dimensional plain   logical  rotate Karl Henry between right winger and number  but  seems  living there  can only really remember two spells where  seemed they were bucking this trend  for  stretch  the first half  last season Vargas and Isla were clicking well and  moved the ball nicely down the right wing and  the early part  this season when Luongo and Chery were involved and  were unlocking opposition defenses and scoring goals while admittedly shipping them  well  seems Vargas and Isla were horribly handled though  common with  long list  other players over the past few years Mackie Faurlin Simpson McCarthy Mutch Vargas Isla Yun Diakité Doughty and number  young players sure you can all add  few names You can mess players around  this degree and expect  positively develop the product  the pitch  getting sick   and  becoming tough  get behind the  guys  the pitch when season after season the characters who kick off  August aren those starting  few months later

The management  the club  another issue Would Fernandes and his pals have bought QPR   wasn  Premier League club Has  ever had  solid plan for what   with QPR   non club The Tune Group tenure has seen  lot  unexpected twists and turns   they had had  deal with relegation   maybe they would have learned some valuable lessons sooner  the Redknapp Championship squad didn fluke promotion they might have started  solid rebuild earlier Ephraim mentioned Redknapp was  cert for the exit prior  Wembley They have had  uncontrollable unpredictable animal  QPR which they have left others  handle from  distance and christ knows under Beard and Redknapp and whatever forces were  work  the dressing room things went from bad  worse  had hoped that Ferdinand and Hoos coming  and making the right noises would have    happier place now but  sceptical based  what  see week  week out There seems    lack  backbone courage and discipline  don see  lot  conviction and willingness  stand their ground  the face  dressing room egos and rabid fans  think they also showed  lot  weakness  dealing with the assets that the club had over the summer Sometimes you need  drop the asking price   seller Sometimes you need   more proactive  force through the sale  suspected that Austin and Phillips should have been cashed   think  hunch was right  well  reaping  financial benefit which  now won see the squad selection would  simpler Throughout the Fernandes era  suspect the only player  possibly seen  profit   Remy After four years  still yet  see evidence that they know how  handle the football market

Lastlythe supporters themselves You can condemn them entirely for baring their fangs after  few years  absolute abuse from many elements  the club but  seems they reached this level  baseline discontent where some really poisonous voices are able  make themselves heard much more easily There always  witch hunt  Fer seems   the latest victim and  was booed off the pitch yesterday  been most anonymous and shit but   derided   ran off  not here because  bleeds blue and white  all know that but  hasn pissed  the badge Karl Henry Traoré Mbia There seems  always need   one  the starting  that people can line   the crosshairs Apparently Ferdinand was berated   older suppporter  Loftus Road yesterday about Leroy Fer  which Les replied  was  confidence thing  that  the case how  throowing him  sea  wanker signs   hits the bench going  help And then  course there was the whole furore around Ramsey which has been well covered  must   shit atmosphere  play  and  certainly often  shit atmosphere  attend   supporter   lot  ways QPR reminds   the pub  used  get dragged    babysitters family back  the day just off Hanger Lane that  longer exists  collection  familiar faces getting together for  drink and  good time   double edged sword because for all the charm character and continuity that brings  becomes very hard  evolve    something more contemporary without maintaining all  that and pissing off the traditional core Maybe  just the curse  modern football hitting home Head over  Twitter and behold the timeline  Steve Gallen axing  seemingly confirmed  Kevin Gallen   witness how this plays out  the real world",977,2015-12-28

Steven Caulker  heard the rumours  palace interested  buying him permanently due  him being surplus  requirements  southampton after the van dijk deal Rumours state that  would  involved   swap deal with Dwight Gayle  they give some   really  hope these rumours are true gayle would produce  solid replacementpartner for Austin who possesses great pace something  lack this year 

Sandro For    good day this guy  the best defensive midfielder  the league Him and Faurlin together are easily our best midfield partnership doesnt help that they are the  most injury prone players  the club  heard rumours  clubs coming  for him this window and  really like him  stay  worst comes  worst and  does leave  like  see Michael Doughty back  the side

Hoilett This   strange one for  For someone thats sat  his ass enjoying his   week for the past season   this guy has impressed  recent weeks and looked like our biggest threat   keep him based  his recent form    get rid  him  hes  liability  think  got   kept    the only one that actually takes  man   our side 

Matt Phillips Although  had  great run  form towards the end  last season and the beginning  this season  think hes the most overrated player  our football club His talent  undeniable but hes  lazy and unfit its unreal  barely ever takes his man  and never jumps for the ball with any desire 

 think the squad   whole  highly overrated Without Austin this squad  nothing but  championship side our midfield depth isnt  the quality  needs    NEED full backs and  cant express how badly  need  decent winger adomah cries out   Anyway thats  thoughts  like  hear yours  please leave any comments below

Out

 Austin  Done  great job for the club but getting million would  great   reinvested into the club Even with Austin staying  don see  strong enough side  push for promotion

 Fer  Fer has been  off player since his arrival Some days    game winner other days  seems invisible  the pitch Get some cash for him and allow Luongo and Doughty some time  the pitch 

 Traore  What has even happened  him

 Karl Henry  Maybe keep   squad player but  just don see this love affair managers seem  have with him

 Caulker  Reported interest from Palace recall and sell him Doesn seem  have  future  the club




 Dwight Gayle  Palace looking  offload with joint interest  Caulker perhaps  straight swap  something both clubs would  interested  Would   good pacey replacement for Austin

 Damien McCrory  Hasselbaink knows him from Burton Hopefully would get Konchesky out  the team  Yun seems   forgotten about

 Bradley Dack  Young scoring goals and would   great fit for our midfield

Fair enough  has not won any  the six games and some seriously poor football have been displayed but what were you expecting Six straight  wins

Forget promotion Forget the fucking playoffs even This  the time needed for JFH  figure out what needs   done who needs  find the exit door and who needs   signed Everybody spoke about taking  couple seasons  the lower leagues only  return stronger But then  kept Austin Phillips Sandro and Fer and all   sudden not getting promoted would   disaster Ridiculous Sell Austin  January get  striker  Dwight Gayle maybe two and for the love  God find  replacement for Robert Green  been costing  too many points through personal errors Dan Bentley was reportedly upset when Southend United wouldn let him join QPR  the summer get   bid for him ASAP

And what the actual fuck does Massimo Luongo have    get  game Karl Henry contributions are next  nothing yet   the starting  week  week out  the few   games Luongo has played  has impressed   least  runs for hours  end  fights and scraps like few others and   still young and very hungry for success 

Would like  see Leroy Fer sold  the January transfer window  well Spoke with  football commentator who  also  Norwich City supporter and  told  when things aren going Leroy way  has  motivation and  shows When  goes  ground  doesn jump   pulls himself  slowly doesn look interested Can blame him though Going from playing and scoring  the Premier League and World Cup   playing Rotherham away  just not  all worth his wage has scored one goal this season and that was  bloody tap

 note  Polter Apart from the  minute  set  Phillips and converted the following cross  was rubbish last night  again  has the techical ability   donkey and his passing accuracy can  higher than  Ramsey was banging  about his physique when  signed him but tbh  not looking particularly physically superior  anyone  been way more impressed with JET would also like  see Mackie  top again let not forget  scored  goals  his first  games for  when  signed   Polter may work his socks off but frankly that not enough

Players  would like  see signed

Josh Meekings  Young English centre back who been  Reliable for Iverness  the Scottish top flight Last season  even booked himself  place  the Team  the Year and for  centre back  got really good pace and also physique  has much  the same problem  Polter his physique and defending  very much   scratch but his technical abilities  nowhere   seen But let  honest who needs  more   striker   centre half


Tom Bradshaw  Already  Wales international Tom scored  goals from  league appearances last season and  far this season  has got  from  appearances Not   material for  Championship side pushing for promotion but good back and one for the future


Daniel Bentley  Despite his young age Dan has already got over  professional appearances  his name With  aging Robert Green and  unconvincing Alex Smithies Dan might just  what  need",645,2016-01-02
superhoops," agree that anyone calling for JFH head after less than  matches   lunatic but unfortunately they exist  abundance among QPR support and  fear  end  with the doomed club the more rabid sections    and  blocks are calling for

 also agree  Luongo  really depressing that  can get  the squad

 think calling Polter rubbish and Smithies unconvincing based   and  match minutes respectively especially when the former has racked  two goals and  assist over the last two weeks  harsh  Polter case this sums  best how  feel about httploftforwordsfansnetworkforumpage

Polter   interesting example  how the dynamic  the crowd and the support has changed  Loftus Road Previously  absolutely reveled  having those unconventional underdog players  our team Maybe not technically the best maybe  bit odd  watch maybe  bit   maverick but  effort totally committed and effective  used  absolutely love somebody like that and make cult heroes  them Jamie Mackie Devon White Danny Shittu Stuart Wardley maybe Rufus Brevett maybe 

Now  absolutely pummel Polter even when  doing  good job for the team and both scoring and setting  goals regularly presumably because  think    club should  above that and should  out there spending more money  accomplished strikers and big names  like that worked  all for  over the past five years  know some  here get their hackles   the word spoilt when  been used about the supporters this season but  certainly changed   group  fans

 won  few headers got physically stuck  regardless  the outcome and won  few fouls Playing  the top  the pitch his mistakes aren going   punished  harshly  say Fer Onuoha  Green were  you really want  start crucifying people for  end product  the final third redirect your anger towards Hoilett Fer and Phillips all  whom almost certainly    far greater cost  the club

 for the signings Gayle aint coming   lower half Championship team Your defender would have  play third fiddle behind Onuoha and Hall Signing Bentley would  farcical given that the only things that have changed since  last tried  sign him are  signed someone else and   longer have any hope  promotion

Bradshaw looks promising but  being linked   lot  other clubs already  would definitely address  need Other than the rightback spot  where they seem   going   the cheap with Motta   extra striker  the only position  think they should address given Austin  gone  June",481,2016-01-02

Matt Phillips  Maybe  was because  didn want  sell him  someone else  the championship but please  someone bids anymore than  million again take the money and run away before they find out hes not worth   The one thing  will give  him  that  can cross  ball and its the only reason  still  the side When you look  someone like Van  Parra  yesterdays game  really puts into perspective how lazy Matt Phillips   had  good run  form  the  half  last season and somehow managed  see his valuation double   was JFH  sell Matty and  straight  the phone  Van  Parra agent Thats  times  seen him this season when  was  loan  brighton and both times  outshined matty phillips  the winger supposedly worth  million 

Leroy Fer  Worst player  the pitch yesterday Apart from scoring  few tap ins  has been awful all season When you play him    where the midfield plays such  important part you cant  expecting  take anything from the game Lazy Slow sell him ASAP

Karl Henry  Dont think  need  write anything How this man gets  the team over Faurlin Luongo Sandro and Doughty when  was here really does confuse  Once again another goal conceded that started from his error

Full Backs   need new full backs Konchesky got embarrased yesterday Hes  Slow cant cross  ball and  going  the different direction  our club  would like  see Yun play but god knows where     would  nice  see  buy  young energetic left back Perch does  job  right back but  still think  need someone else there  Perch gets injured and forces chief  play   are asking  concede goals  

Some positives  Thought Polter was outstanding  the first half yesterday  may not have the technical ability but  does not stop working and thats exactly the type  player you want  the championship From the small time that Washington was  the pitch  did look promising  looking forward  the future with this kid Chery miss really was  shame but  cannot help but feel sorry for him Had  great first couple  starts and has suddenly been dropped for his dutch colleague leroy who again contributed nothing  think  should  given  consistent run  the side before   judged Massimo Luongo should  playing every game  wins balls that  has  right  win and really doesnt stop working  can really see him having  bright future  long    not dropped Finally Alex Smithies Given the number  shirt and  stepped  big time  trio  outstanding saves and  generally good performance was very pleasing  and  was nice  see  goalkeeper kick past the half way line for once 

With  bit more luck   see  bright future under Jimmy The majority seem  have accepted now that its  rebuilding process and the performances are getting better Some may disagree but for   cash   Phillips and Fer bring  some more young talent and then think about competing next year COYR",617,2016-01-24
superhoops," agree with most  that  this point   thinking about the financial side  things  maximise  fees wherever possible and shift high earners The books simply have   balanced Unfortunately  aren living   ideal world and the only fee  can imagine  for Phillips and   happy  they got the same price they paid for him  this stage Beyond him you looking  the high earners and  make assumptions  their salary based  when they signed Sandro Fer Green Traoré Hoilett and Diakité  think the latter four will see their contracts run down this year   doubtful about moving them out

Edit And  break ranks  the Austin love They should have made more effort  move him  the summer Charlie Austin primarily looked out for himself From interviews and journos  seems that  was the one who didn accept the offers  the table  was the one who didn sign  new contract  the middle  last season QPR lost out  millions that mean  lot more  the Championship Finally think his appearance yesterday puts his last few absences for QPR   slightly darker light There the big transfer failure for  and  was partially out  the club hands  the pantheon  QPR heroes there are currently three still  the books who are more prominent than Charlie Austin",247,2016-01-24

While Konchesky tries   now too easily beaten with pace down that wing   likely going  make  reasonable centreback somewhere

Philips keeps underperforming  perhaps  that  that really  good   gets

 not been  the antiHenry bandwagon Yesterday game changed  mind  times  looks clueless when  wasn even under pressure  excuses for that  just not good enough

All  the statistics that  have used are from WhoScoredcomhttpswwwwhoscoredcom and their  database which  think   great website  use 

 start the comparison off  looked  the saves that the three keepers made per game



Name Apps  Mins  Total Saves   yard box saves Pen Box Saves Out  Box saves  Rating  Clean Sheets 

Smithies                 
Ingram                 
Green               

Overall  seems pretty clear cut that the goalkeeping improved Green being dropped  seems  have had  rough time   during his half season  goal Both Smithies and Ingram seem  have been better  total number  saves and being more confident  the box going  the number  penalty box saves They also seemed  have  much higher rating  well  part  think they benefited from  more stable back line but the number  clean sheets that Smithies had really works  his favour Smithies would appear  come out  top  the pile  quite  margin with Ingram  little behind 

Looking  the other side  the spectrum passing This  where things got  lot more interesting  used the per  stat for these 



Name  Total Passes  Accurate Long  Inaccurate Long  Accurate Short  Inaccurate short

Smithies          
Ingram          
Green          

Surprisingly here Green seems  have the most accurate long kicks per game  still  not miss his horrible short kicks Smithies and Ingram seem   similar enough when you take   account the difference  the number  kicks that they take  per game and that something that the stats don explain

What the stats don show are some  the more intangible features such  commanding the box and collecting crossescorners However  think that the reason that Smithies saves more shots  because   better  organising the players  front  him 

 guess  wrote this  get peoples thoughts heading   the new season  think Smithis  the clear number  for Leeds but Ingram  young and hungry and  happy that  have options  goalkeeper  even with  long term injury  should  covered What  other people think  this useful",525,2016-08-03

Aerial Duel success    
Succesful dribbles    
Tackles    
Possession    

 found   little surprising that outside  the shots and shots  target  seem  have been level pegging with Leeds throughout the match Happy with the tackles  well especially  our top tackler was Massimo Luongo with  

The whole team chipped  defensively which fits with the idea that  working more like  unit and that JFH tactics are paying off Nedum led the team with  interceptions with Karl Henry just behind with  Caulker had  clearances  pace   and shows  nice balance between the central defence and full backs 

What was also interesting was that  created  attempts  goal from set pieces something that  feel  been  little poor   the past couple  seasons And  was even more pleasing  get that goal  the  minutes off   corner  nice not having  deal with Matty Phillips delivery  also had  interceptions and hopefully that sort  number carries  over the season 

What was also somewhat interesting was the difference  passes attempted our  However  pumped   crosses  their  something that  feel really showed  the day especially with Shomide who had  attempts and Chery who had  What  also very promising  that  seem  have cut reliance  the long ball only attempting  over the course  the  minutes

Overall the stats suggest that the match was much closer than the Leeds game From what  read and heard  were set    much more compact shape happy  absorb the pressure 

This  borne out  the number  clearances that our  pairing made  the match   total with Caulker pretty much  unanimous man  the match making   those  managed  deal with their crosses very very well and didn seem   too flustered  think this  also reflected  the relatively low number  tackles that  made  the match  with the majority coming  midfield with Luongo yet again leading the team this time with  completed tackles Luongo also lead the team  passes     does seem   growing  importance and works well beside  midfielder like Henry who just presses  wasn the most accurate player however with that honour going  Henry who made  passes    clip

  slightly more worrying note  lost possession  lot more than our opponents losing   times  their   think this may  more   with our shape and style  play away from home where  will  set    difficult  beat  not  win the game  playing really attractive football   keep picking  points though  not going  complain 

Our trend  being dangerous off  set pieces carried  this match with  generating  attempts from set pieces Having been relatively ineffectual over the last couple  seasons this  also  nice positive change 

Caulker netted our goal obviously from  lovely delivery from Bidwell and hopefully  will see him score  least  couple more from those situations  also saw Polter earn   penalty and Chery convert Chery and Caulker both paced the side with  shots each and  good  see Chery  involved 

Overall  good team performance and  aggressive one with our team picking   cautions but  early days and nothing   too unduly worried about 

Finally despite mentioning that  were set    deep formation the heatmap shows  being all over the pitch and just outside  our boxhttpswwwwhoscoredcomMatchesLiveEnglandChampionshipCardiffQueensParkRangers

superhoops,"Just  add  bit more  this   bored  work  lunchtime

Attack

 are yet  score  goal from open play with  goals coming from set pieces and  from penalties 

 also are last  the league  crosses per game  which with Polter  our starting   thought wouldn  the case although  does seem    lot better with the ball  his feet than  might  first appear  compensate though  fifth  long balls per game  which  when  pump the ball   Polter   can get our midfielders involved 

 seem  favour attacking down the right side slightly more than the left  with  much lower preferences for the middle    attacks  think this ties  well  the way  which  have fluid wingers and attackers Chery being  exampe who likes  roam the pitch However interestingly the majority  our shot attempts come from the middle  rather than any other side but that does put  near the bottom  out   
 are dead  the middle  the table for where our shots come from with   shots coming  the  yard box   the  yard box and  from outside placing    and  compared  other championship sides 

Defence

Another interesting tidbit  currently   the league  the amount  yellow cards  have conceded with  and  extra  listed  other  assume this  timewasting Although  are   the amount  fouls  give away   match which  interesting considering the amount  yellows  then receive 

  seem    lot better  set pieces  also have  very god  pairing and are getting more sound defensively  are currently   the league  aerial duels won per match   Ipswich are top with  which stands   good stead moving forward What  also interesting  that  have concede  fair few goals from shots  target currently  only make  save per game putting  dead last  the division 

Conclusion

 think the picture  get  that  are  tight unit  the back with two CBs good  the air and  settled holding midfield pairing  protect them  Henry and Luongo  seem    lot lot better  set pieces both  attack and defending them which   welcome change with the midfield that  have  think  only  matter  time until  start scoring from open play and putting that ball  the box for Polter may  the way   that now  have  very fluid attacking midfield and with the additions  Sylla Wszolek and Gbakoto  with Chery could stand   very good stead Neddie  the  best ranked defensive player  the league with Caulker   and  they can keep  their early season form  should   very very tough team  beat That enough rambling from

superhoops," taken points from video  you don have time  watch Hopefully this gives some insight 

 Only missed out  one signing  won mention who
 Yeni was first target  talks were complicated for various reasons  other clubs people  his ear etc
 Sylla  goal scorer strong  the air team player more  his game  expect him  score  few
 Furlong  easy decision  loan him out wanted him  make the step  but wasn better currently than Perch  Ned
 Doughty    was going   one   mids couldn  guaranteed first team football and wanted   out  loan himself Hoping  improve and  may  able  come back and challenge for  place next season 
 Cole Kpekawa  Didn want  lose him but felt  was the best thing for his career Got  the point you can bring  horse  water but you can make  drink  fitnessdisciple issues 
 Club doesn publish transfer fee  keep their spending close  their chest  agents etc can take advantage
 Club has been working hard  reinstate right attitudevalues through work ethic pride etc throughout the club
 Les said  looking for Professionalism from players
 Sandro  had issues when  first come back from Holiday but has been working hardgood attitude every since JFH going  give him  chance provided  stays professional which  has been doing 

 Training Ground  only two residents have put  for judicial review   rejected they can move forward  four weeks   granted the process can take  months  work through  feels confident  nearly there  expected licence for work   granted   weeks Judicial review  last hurdle 
 Stadium  First huge win was planning permission for developing houses   vital piece for   move forward with the stadium  Think this basically means that   aren granted the stadium permission  pull our house development 
 Car Giant   got planning permission  that all  concerned about  there  alternative  look  that 
 Redeveloping Loftus Road   said  not possible due  size  landarea around 
 Loftus  Facilities  location  Family stand  Only  season ticket holders misplaced from where family stand has gone  now got  season ticket holders  the family stand   were  move them  doesn know where 
 High percentage  season ticket holders are  and above low percentage are below    need  work  the demographic  bring younger fans  Wants  make club personal  about the fans 
 Drinks prior  Kick Off  issue  regarding licencing Can drink within site  the pitch can drink within mins  kick off  mins before end  game 
  Thinks that there are ways   safe standing  games but the  have issues with  Germany has standing sections that work well but Europe UEFA has rules  place  ensure everyone  seated 
 Names  back  seats  right now  not getting the basics  the stadium done fixing toilets etc   want  focus  that Not ruling  out possibly have  premium section where ticket holders can pay  bit more   able  offset the cost  the club

 Club finances  have  tip your hats  the owners for turning the mil  debt into equity and taking the correct steps  sort out finances going fowrard
 Fan base   Club finished    but average attendance was only  Our attendance  actually better now than back then Praises those who have stuck  the club through thick and thin
 Forever Kick  the   chap got  and rambled for about  mins about giving money  previous club players Lee Hoo asked for him  provide figures had apparently asked for this before but the guy couldn provide  Some others asked the guy  wrap   Lee tried  talk  everyone about hearing him outrespecting one another the guy then cut him off with some back handed comments Rambled some more then asked for Lee  come back  him 
 JFH  Would   happy with  top  finish  Jimmy replied  always wants more     the  standard now  not good enough for the     the championship 
 Cousins  JFH see him  the middle  the park Playing  the right because  circumstances and because  versatile 
   Horrible fence  Stadium  Council  not want people   able   into that end  working   Council issue  the migration between stands 
 Away fans tickets different colour  looking   this going forward already had stack  old tickets  had  get rid  
 Away fixtures Newcastle then Blackburn looking  options about whether the team comes back  stays  North Football league trying  eliminate midweek fixtures altogether The club can  anything about the long distance trips 
 Grassroots football   scouts  their games etc but other clubs are there Les   trying  improve our scouting within London
 Names  seats  old badge was taken off  people who had names  their seats were taken off  the same time 
 Atmosphere  club can really influence this  referenced Palarse Ultras section and how they had limitations put  them  the club  happy  listen  suggestions  people think there something that will improve the atmosphere  wondered  people who were relocated from the Lower Loft would  happy going into the upper loft where there are mainly nonseason ticket holders  try and raise the atmosphere  there 
 Les mentioned that the fans energise the players  this has changed since  was playing  people come  games expecting  being entertained 
 JFH  emphasized the importance  fans supporting ALL the players especially the young kids  they need the extra support 
 Disabled supporters  coach tickets for carers were taken away  said  look into  QPR way below wheelchair seating compared  other clubs   will look into 
   disappointed people have contacted the club and one got back  him 
 Players brought  have  compete for places  not just brought   cover 
 JFH asked   regrets joining   looks more stressed  said  tries  stay  calmenjoy the game  much  possible  but   bigger club etc  there are different expectations from Burton
 Yeni  can play rightleft and striker Depends match  match where  play

superhoops," was there  was terrible But  think  worth trying  dissect the match from last night Were  just unlucky  catch Newcastle  great form  were  set  badly  think   bit  both with the added caveat that  were missing our two key players  Luongo and Polter

The statistics make horrendous viewing




Statistic  QPR  Newcastle

Shots    
Shots  target    
Pass success     
Aerial Duel Success     
Dribbles won    
Tackles    
Possession    

Some  those are even very misleading the possession statistic doesn  justice  what Newcastle did   and how poor  were  lot  our possession was between the backline without any real aim This  where Luongo would have been very useful  the engine that drives  forward without him Cousins and Henry just look awful Lots  side  side passing with  aim  also have  admit that the ball found itself  the feet  Onuoha and Caulker far too often Our best passing defenders are both Bidwell and Hall 

The shot disparity pretty much sums  the game for those  you who weren actually there  were  the back foot after the first  minutes and never really recovered  were facing  shot pretty much every  minutes nearly Our whole line had  very defensive sound   with  defenders starting but  were more open tonight than against any other team  have faced this season and  showed  lined      lot  our problems started with the midfield and forward line being miles apart  leaving Shelvey  totally free  dominate   think the first time  fouled him was  the  minute This was borne out  the statistics with Newcastle having committed  fouls  our  Very poor   just didn disrupt their flow Our aerial   also miles off from the usual and that because Newcastle ran   time and time again They also had  big strong presence  top with Mitrovic  not too far from what  try   with Polter 

 were also poor defending set pieces  well both Hanley and Clark two CBs scored 

Some Analysis

There are  good statistics  pick out here  all But  think JFH got  very wrong with his tactics  set    formation  haven really utilised and had Washington playing   Polter like fashion with  success whatsoever  was slow  react  changing the system with Sylla only coming  when  were  down Polter  key  the manner  which  play   throws his body around and works like  first defender Washington just doesn have the same presence and cannot compete for the high balls  hold  play  well  much better   out wide  running behind the defence something that wasn going  happen with that tall physical Newcastle back line 

Second the midfield seems listless and too far from the forward players and  has for  couple  games Luongo has been the midfielder  have been relying   battle win back the ball and run  the opposing team Henry and Cousins aren  assertive and that really showed  the last couple  games Blackburn was just  bad 

 not saying that  would have won  with those two  the side but  think they the ones who play with real fire  their belly and get players involved Chery was totally isolated and ineffective and that because  didn have that forwardmidfield support from Polter and Luongo who complement Chery  well NoPolterNoParty

 were also unlucky  face  fully realised Newcastle team that had won   the bounce before last night Mitrovic and Perez form  partnership that  way too good for this league Mitrovic twice beat Onuoha    keep tearing  hair out when  played   with pace  cause havoc  our box resulting  two goals with Shelvey burying one and Perez the other  the second chance Perez himself tortured  all game long and Shelvey was the MOTM capped with that fantastic goal  one   country mile  put any pressure  him though They seem   clicking  all cylinders and are simply too big  club for this league 

Worst league defeat  our history and the first time  have shipped six  the league since   Coventry   think there   way but  from here and  still have some faith  JFH  long   learns from this  need  huge huge reaction against Huddersfield but that will   tough ask with them full  confidence even after losing  Brighton Does anyone else have any thoughts 

Onwards and upwards  guess 

 also was there till the end  dont know why

 recently found out  will  coming  London for  months  study starting  January unfortunately    the east  the city and its about   min tube ride  

 had few questions about seeing the  play and was wondering  anyone had any thoughts

First how easy    get tickets   think  remember seeing the Newcastle game was sold out could  reasonably expect  get tickets for most home games without  season ticket  membership  

Also what games  you guys recommend going   Right now  like the look  Fulham  Jan  Huddersfield  Feb  and Brighton  Apr  although  will probably end  going   many home games  possible   also imagine  sample some prem games   can tickets    right near the Olympic stadium  maybe  see  West Ham game  two although  heard its not that enjoyable  experience

superhoops,QPR have added Curtis Fleming  their backroom staff  First Team Coach,13,2016-12-15
superhoops,"Seems sufficiently close enough  January  start talking about this

First  all  just want  discuss our summer transfers how they are getting  and whether they have  longterm place  the team

Ariel Borysuik  Niggling injuries have largely kept him away from the first team with any sort  consistency   change  manager seems  have lost him some favour  well  However during his spells across Luongo  the midfield  showed the necessary quality  cement  place  the firstteam  Shows good positional awareness physicality tackling and  known for his ability  hit them from afar    Borysuik was always the next iteration  Henry and that type  player pairs well with Luongo

Joel Lynch  Has had his own fair share  niggling injuries and didn  enough  supplant Onuoha  Hall   starting   Has seen time  the team due  injuries but those often meant playing   unnatural position  Has shown flashes  ability and  worthy   spot  the bench for now until  injury  Hall  Onuoha gives him the opportunity  stake his claim  the starting 

Jake Bidwell  Can you believe   only   Probably the best addition  the entire window  Was kept out with  shoulder injury but has otherwise been  lock  the first team and  pleasure  watch  

Jordan Cousins  Another one who has dealt with injury since his arrival  the club  Was unfortunately situated  the wing for  majority  his apps but when played  the middle seems  different player entirely  Has  abundance  energy and arguably played his best game for   our most recent loss  Derby   developing well   player and will continue  feature  the squad

Yeni Gbakoto  Started off well  the squad but was sidelined for  considerable time due   personal issue   niggling injury kept him sidelined  well  Both issues since resolved   making his way back into the squad and put  arguably his best performance   Hooped jersey against Derby  The unfortunate lack  wingers  the team now provided  wing backs under Holloway could diminish his usefulness  the squad

Idrissa Sylla  Striker   position  are poor  and Sylla possesses the best scoring record  the club  Deserves more   run  the first team  Neither Washington  Polter are  any sort  form currently

Pawel Wszolek  Was likely added for depth  the winger position after the loss  Hoilett and Phillips  the summer  Given the absence  Gbakoto was gifted  chance with the first team   part  the Polish national team and has done well  his appearances with   far  Has competition with Gbakoto who also plays  the right and  lack  wingers  the midfield further diminish his chances  breaking into the first team once again

The last one  not  addition but rather  youth player who has come onto the scene with QPR   big way this season  Olamide Shodipo  Plays  the left and has shown genuine hunger for the game    nice  finally see  not having   into the transfer market  replace  player  Has not benefitted from Holloway insistence  playing with  midfield three but occasionally makes  appearance off the bench

 really pleased with the transfers  made  the summer and think they all still have  chance  come good  Although our formation inhibits the wingers specifically there may still  hope yet  With that out  the way let talk about January

Sandro and Henry need     addition  that both  their contracts end come the summer    are going  get anything for them January  our last chance  Gladwin should  out  loan  Simply put   not yet  the level required    Championship player   this scenario  would look  acquire another midfielder   with Luongo Cousins and Borysuik   also need  pursue     similar level  Bidwell  This  should also  able  cover    possible  Perch just doesn cut    can provide cover   but  really doesn  enough game gameout for   challenge promotion   three out and two  simple

  have been planning  finally travel  London from Finland  watch  actual live match  Loftus Road  was thinking    March  Cardiff and   March  Barnsley this  basically the only way  could see two matches  which  have quite good chances  winning within one reasonably longshort visit  you guys think   worth staying the  extra nights costs about  more staying   hotel  see  midweek fixture  don really mind that extra time since there  quite  lot  stuff    London  have seen different opinions  those midweek fixtures some saying they have  good and different atmosphere and some saying the stadium  quite empty  you think the midweek game isn worth the extra money  the match  Cardiff the one  should  looking   are there some other fixtures  Brighton perhaps  should consider

Which are the  seats  should  looking  when booking the seats  main priority would   good view  the middleish areas  the stands  that would narrow the choices  the seats  Ellerslie   South Africa  Since  will likely  another  years when  come and see  match again  don mind possibly spending money  those platinumgraded seats  South Africa  stand but are they worth the money compared  the middle seats  Ellerslie   have heard some horror stories about the huge pillars supporting the roof blocking the view which are the seats  avoid these

  allowed  have  small pocket sized camera with   the matches  have seen quite  few vlogs filmed with those but  just wanted  make sure  any  you guys have any experience with this stuff

And finally   stay that night period  the stadium tour worth considering

For those too lazy  read

Are QPR  Cardiff and QPR  Barnsley good games  watch  not which are   worth spending extra   hotel  see  midweek fixture

Which are the  seats positioned  the middleish area  the pitch

There   bit  formatting stuff  ignore that

 with the previous couple  events there wasn any groundbreaking news but  was  very interesting evening with  excellent insight into the future plans for the club The evening was very heavily focused  the finance side with  deluge  questions being fired  Lee Hoos  the subject but there were some fascinating little snippets particularly with regard  Gary Penrice joining QPR along with  squad update and news  the Stan Bowles benefit game

 total the question and answer lasted almost bang  two hours Some  the questions were bounced back  couple  times during the evening  for the sake  clarity  compiled everything discussed under each header Holloway apologised   number  occasions for rattling off which made this  bit difficult  structure but the below covers everything discussed

The evening started  Paul Morrisey  welcoming Lee Hoos  and Ian Holloway   the room Les Ferdinand was originally supposed    attendance and whilst nobody  the club confirmed the exact reason why  wasn able  come there was  lot  talk that  was due   charity event that  needed  attend  Newcastle

Paul Morrisey opened  asking Ollie how  felt being back  QPR

  Going  championship sackings  might have another  months   Listen  privileged and delighted   back  the way here  was listening   song back together again  the car That how  feels for  There been lots  changes compared  when  was last here After those six defeats   row everyone stuck with  let see where  can  from here

 want some proper hero  QPR again People who will wear that shirt  the same way that all   would Ferdinand   prime example  what  after loads  potential and the right attitude QPR gave him the platform    and  great things  want   the same for some  our youngsters here too

  made good progress  the  years since  been here The average age has decreased considerably  balanced the squad really well and  pleased with where  are heading

TRAINING GROUND
 The judicial review found  favour  the council  what the next steps

  have won every legal battle that has been put  front   This review was  our favour but this could still  appealed The difference now  any appeal would only   option   point  law This  very unlikely 

  mentioned previously there has been  application for  public foot path going straight across the training ground which  due   reviewed  September

This  something that  really want over the line  amongst these appeals and legal processes  seems  have been forgotten that  are putting things  place for the local community  aren developing the land  build  load  property   will  providing pitches that the local children and youngsters can  and play  

 unfortunate that  much money has been spent  legal fees 

 the timescales this has been going  for two years just  get  this stage  can put  definitive timeframe   but  long  foot path goes  our favour then  are pretty much there  has been the case previously they may appeal again  September  the foot path which would again lengthen the time until  can start work Providing  overcome those hurdles the first step would   level off the site and  have the license pretty much granted for that   will  able  start work  soon   signed off  looking good 

NEW STADIUM

 Can  just develop Loftus Road

This site  less than  acres The sites  are looking  are already quite tight and even then  are looking   acres Double what Loftus Road  

Aside from that planning permission would never  granted  this site The restricted light and other factors make   nonstarter  matter how hard you try  simply can  anything  Loftus Road 

 extremely important for   remain  the borough  stones through from Loftus Road ideally

 What the latest  Old Oak Common

 looking increasingly difficult but   still possible

 And what about the report  the Linford Christie site

The Linford Christie site  very early doors  the moment  have been going round and talking with people  the community and starting genuine consultation  need  find out what people issues are and what they want for the area   got Linford Christie the track would not  around the pitch The facilities  the site are very poor   was possible  get  new ground here  would  mutually beneficial   could give them far better facilities than they have now

You got  get that blend right Look  Connor Washington the best thing that  could  for him was getting someone  who can win  header  knew  the squad knew   not  winger  not  lonestriker either Now  has partner  believes  can score goals And  showing  

Listen Coming here and wearing that badge isn easy  you aren scoring  hitting that ground running some fans get  your back 

COME  HOLLOWAY  GIVE   WILKINS

laughter

You need  blend  was  midfielder with Wilkins That the bit you need  get right

 could easily have panicked  January but  didn   terrible time  buy and sell  tough when players are telling you that they want  leave  not professional for   speak  certain positions for next season right now everyone  doing what asked 

But  pleased how things are going  would like   score more goals but  can complain 

Long term our scouting network   the march  won name names but  are making massive progress Everyone that good  ahead  the game You need eyes  everyone  Europe  need  find your Kante What did  cost

 aren gonna throw  around like  used  but that didn   any good anyway did  

Whether you  tackler  passer  flair player there never  excuse for not trying And you seen enough  those haven you 

You might not like everyone that  bring  but you won say aren trying

FAMILY STAND

 Can  move the family stand What about putting them  the Paddocks  ruining the atmosphere

 Move the kids along  the Paddock area Firstly the Paddocks are mostly season ticket holders   not sure how they would feel about this  you want these kids  grow  love the club sticking them out  paddocks probably isn the best way   about  People talk  atmosphere but  don think  that bad Last year against Brighton the place was rocking Against Norwich  was superb too for  the atmosphere  very heavily linked  what happening  pitch

You saying   fault

LAUGHTER

   new stadium  could put the family stand   better position But  Loftus Road  are stuck with where  

  quite common for fans   hit  the ball  the warm  can this  addressed

That   fault   the shooting practice

MORE LAUGHTER

 Next season that will  eliminated  will have nets  front  where players warm   already have the footings  place

TARGETS FOR NEXT SEASON

 What the target for next season Ollie

  better than  were this year Let target the top half  the table  not playoffs Everyone wants   there but let have    touched   earlier but our scouting network needs   better  want better players here don 

 visited Real Madrid when  was out  work    normally  

LAUGHTER

 was shown around   little man called Paco  didn speak  word  English The facilities were absolutely stunning beautiful They had  surgical operating theatre  the training ground  was unbelievable  palace 

 had lunch and watched them all train train Through the interpreter Paco turned and said   all you really need  one pitch one ball and bloody good players

LAUGHTER

BURTON FIXTURE

 Moving forward the Burton game looked  good idea But why rest the players

 hold  hands   that one that was  fault Speaking  Birch quickly  saying  should bring  forward  didn realise  was  close  the window and had  known  would have left    was  would have been stronger playing them  the Tuesday Okay  lost  what Would  lose   played them again  don think   was wrong   management  should have looked   properly but  take full responsibility  that one

ACCOUNTS

 How are things looking  the finances  cut the losses from    that good news right

  the first time for  that   loss has been celebrated   success Make  mistake  have  very tough job ahead    the future  will  hard  sustain even this amount and the parachute payments will  cut  half next season too Then they totally stop shortly after that   keep even this level  loss  very difficult  need   faster and work smarter than other clubs 

 comes back  what Ollie said the importance  our scouting  critical Other clubs can afford  make mistakes with transfers  can  that side this January was probably the best transfer window  ever been involved with since  been  football

 January was very good  have some very big shoes  fill  lost Charlie Austin and apart from only Chery was getting any goals Nobody else was scoring  again comes back  balance and blend  experience and youth Some  the young lads have been sensational Manning and Furlong Wow This  what  all want

United built  era  youth  want  see the same here Maybe  can manage young Furlong son one day  hasn had him yet but that what  want 
LAUGHTER

 need  get the signings right  Palace  paid  for Dwight Gayle  tell you  was worried  had only played for Peterborough Fortunately  worked out well 

But  putting things  place that will keep you all happy for  long long time  you have that top top knowledge you don have too much  worry about 

 didn like the flashiness that never been   told  need  move but  don particularly want  leave Loftus Road this place  special Let make sure that  nurture the right kind  people  play for   already happening Right now

Some  them before weren here for the right reasons The deals weren right  don have that   anymore  make deals like that 

The lower league scouting here was amazing once upon  time  see Andy Sinton  the back there Where did  get you from Cambridge wasn 
Shouts  Brentford from various people

 WHAT 

laughter

 Good old Brentford  tell you one thing about them though their scouting network isn bad    need   the same

 Sticking with the accounts can you give  forecast  how the next set will look
  can give you  forecast but  would say  will  roughly the same next year   harder though  touched  with the parachute payments etc  are showing foresight and looking ahead  all aspects  QPR

 Why  Reuben charging interest  money  has loaned  the club
 The loans that  puts   open  anyone else that wants  contribute  the same basis The interest  converted into shares  the club 

STAN BOWLES BENEFIT MATCH

 There  long and short answer here Let  explain  job Picture   being employed  drive the van from one destination  another  need  avoid hazards and make sure  are going  the right route The passengers can look out the window and what  going  outside  need  focus  keeping the club  the right line

 far the GoFundMe page has raised  for Stan and his family What  the objective  this benefit match   financial   recognition 

 did the day for Stan  Alzheimer Society which was  great success and great for him  got his acknowledgement and recognition 

 not sure that the original group really knew what they were aiming for Personally  don believe Loftus Road  the right venue for the day  these kind  events they notoriously don have anywhere near the level  support they think they get when the days comes 

 not unfair  say that the previous committee didn gel together  tried  get the right people that had experience  organising these kinds  events  now have  superb team together doing this 

One  the members organised  previous testimonial There were massive tax implication  this and one  them suggested doing  through the QPR Community Trust This makes  VAT exempt which automatically increased takings   

 working  hours per week trying  organise this kind  thing isn easy  now have  structure and  think  will have  date within the next  days

FFP

  hoping for this   resolved  start  the season  just after the start  next season  limited  what  can say  they keep reminding  But  going  real pace now and will  resolved soon

TRANSFER BUDGET FOR NEXT SEASON

 What the transfer budget for next season

  club  their right mind would disclose that kind  information  don want  tell every club how much  have  spend
laughter

INJURY UPDATES

 Can you keep  more updated  player injuries

  hear what you saying but things aren always clear cut  injuries Jordan Cousins was close  coming back and then  complained   bit  pain and turned out  had ripped the muscle right off the bone Jack Robinson  still struggling with some older injuries that keep niggling him  very difficult  know day  day how long each will take

LuaLua  thought was going   out for weeks  can tell you  will  out training with    couple  days time and  back way ahead  schedule 

The other thing  that  don want  help the opposition prepare  saying who may  may not  available That does   disservice 

 tell you one thing though this team   sharp  any that  managed over the past  years The confidence  flowing and the belief  building all the time  amazing 

Against Norwich  had them down   men  scored two goals and  absolutely terrified   went any deeper  would have been  the main road

 took time  get that mentality out Players need results and rules when that blend  right they all believe  what  doing  getting there

TRAVEL amp SUPPORT  AWAY GAMES

 Official coaches are very expensive can the club arrange train travel for supporters  more comfortable and  cheaper for supporters

  already lose money  coach travel Rail companies were previously offering deals  clubs where you could offer discounted travel  supporters but they have stopped doing  now  aren trying  make money  this just covering the costs would  great

 Could  get players  acknowledge fans more when getting off the coach  away games

 Personally  always stop and talk  anyone But  don want  change the player prematch routine Each  them  different Connor wants  get  the zone  has his headphones   until kick off You wouldn believe how superstitious they are  will  all  can for you but changing things prematch  something  not prepared    any club events believe  they will chat and mix with everyone But   match day players need  focus  their own individual way and  would never get  the way  that

For  when the game ends  absolutely vital  acknowledge the support But sometimes when you lose you feel you have let everyone down  hurts 

Speaking personally when  lost   Rotherham  few weeks back  didn want   over and clap everyone  was fuming 

But   want  group  people that feel like you  for   all  one This group care  know they  They care about you  need that message going through  everyone When you have that you can achieve unbelievable things 

This  the best trip  ever been    dooo

That what  want  hear the QPR fans singing  want you   proud  want you  enjoy   won always  right sometimes  will  wrong The beauty with this league  you can lose  third  your games and still get promoted 

SCOUTING STRUCTURE

 You both mentioned  lot about the scouting can you give  anymore info

  expanding  can tell you who coming because  working elsewhere but  definitely coming  has loads  experience and  worked together for  long time  never given   bad character  knows  lot  people veey well connected People  France Spain Portugal  will know everyone everywhere 

The investment needs  right here Luckily for  the board have put this  place for   better for the club that   here than  here Long term you will  thinking wow look  him 

This particular person recommended that  signed Luke Freeman for   knew his contract situation and that  was under   knew everything about him   fantastic addition 

The club have been after this individual for about    years now  wants  work with  again   going  come 

 guarantee  you   tells   sign someone  wouldn need  see him myself  will  the right sort  you don play him  will work harder play harder  need saleable assets  never been  confident   life 

Watford spend   year just  scouts wages Benatia who now playing  Juventus they paid  for him  could have had him  Blackpool for  per week but they wouldn pay the wages That was nothing for  player like him  was then sold later  for  

Every time  see him playing for Bayern  call  Oysten and say You seen who playing

LAUGHTER

This same individual recommended that  sign him That same person was involved with Kante and Mahrez  found them  won  too far off the pace

 all feels right  know how     have had some adversity  was excellent because  came through  lot  crap didn   was horrendous but  got there  the end Then unfortunately  was put  gardening leave   very unsavoury character  can name names but cough Paladini cough

 did  just say that

HEAVY LAUGHTER

OTHER QUESTIONS

 What reservations did you have about returning  QPR

 The only reservation  had was whether  wife would let   had  sit down and ask her  she would let  come When you take over   manager  takes over everything your whole life   big thing  give  But Kim feels about QPR the same    Fortunately 

 almost had  time but thank you thanks  Kim thanks  the club  feels fantastic for  Even  the bad moments  feel you trust  

 all want  get back  that top flight But the top four keep getting all the money keep growing keep building When you   you  danger  wrecking yourself  trying  stay there  needs   small steps and for   always think about the club first  need     bit   time 

You put  with enough here haven you  not about where someone comes from  about where they want   What might Manning  worth  the future

 Can  have the dennis the mennis kit back next year

  can have  every single year but  will come back  some point Interestingly the feedback  this year kit was amazing Hoops all the way round finally  actually sold more the previous year with the hoops not going all the way round  still can get  head around that following the reaction  received  

 There still confusion over  role can you confirm what  does

   wish  was here 

 ties all  the footballing departments together  the first point  contact with agents   great person  have around the club   gem   man  have  board And  all done with  smile and  arrogance Perhaps next time   one  these  can get Les  run through  typical day  his  explain how his role works

 Management  evolving  used   that the managers did everything from the signings  the players  writing  the contracts The amounts  money involved are enormous now you can possibly  all these things yourself Without Les  would have struggled  come back 

 impossible for     job properly   was dealing with agents and all  the signings His role  absolutely invaluable     vital  allowing   organise  group The other bonus for   that  can  bad cop sometimes  someone wants  sort contract they can  talk  Les  not   has huge role  what club will turn into 

The deals here used  run out  control Now  will  for the best option  the deal isn right  for the club then  move   target  

 also want Les  the training pitch just half hour would benefit some  our lads  end

 With every referee against QPR how  you feel about video assistance coming 

 This   long time coming  was the first time  ever lost  after scoring  legitimate goal Blackburn The lino said  was impossible  see the header and  absolutely sure  crossed the line   didn give  Our analyst knew straight away  was mad Referees should  able  have  personality but the way  see  they are all turning into robots They have  tough job but with video replays  will  least  fair

 The Stars   amp was  great evening Can   this more regularly please

  will try and  more events There  plenty going  behind the scenes Problem   you have too many  these events  goes from being special  being the norm  are very pleased with how many fans said that they enjoyed 

 Ollie how much  you change tactics depending  who  play

 Yeah  change   lot  realised  wasn working when  lost  games   row  were too open  couldn score and  couldn defend The lads weren comfortable with  and  aren   level where  can impose our game  any opposition and  and win

 Leeds  totally changed   nullify Wood  shackled them and  should have won  Before the lads couldn deal with changes now  are winning they can switch   and they comfortable with  few different systems 

 teams start pressing and cutting out our passing  can  straight  Smith and play from there   dying art players like that The players knew  needed  Having him here lets the others grow 

The foreign players are settling  now Sylla Yeni Pawel They haven been here long two  them barely speak any English Which   good job because  don either 

Some players have issues  they aren    send them home  think about  and tell them  come back  different person tomorrow Players can  spoilt but that ain happening here Not anymore And  will benefit from  eventually 

Look  Lukaku Yeah  signing  new deal    isn Everton don have any ambition  not signing   selfish attitude and  don put  with that

 Could the Blue and White bar  utilised better Having Sky game  Have  player  there after the game

  difficult with players they normally want   their own thing after the game

  can force them     you want 

laughter

 Let have  look  this   really important part  things
  lot  the time those available players are over  the family zone but  can see

 What are the club doing  encourage new fans  QPR

 Well the family zone has been  real success  lot  kids are coming  the club New season tickets holders     this year compared  just  last year That not returning fans  lapsed  holders That  NEW fans The interest free  scheme has been taken  and made  more affordable for  lot  fans  come back  Loftus Road

 What happening with Ravel Morrison

  have  kids and they all needed  earn their ice cream Ravel ice cream  that  just wants  play His training isn always what  should  and his timing isn always what  should  

 needs  earn his team mates respect and work hard  them That wouldn have been hard few months ago let  honest But when Ryan Manning  running       flat out And then Pawel beats that Poor old Rav has  way   hasn  

 know his game isn all about running but  need  hold the ball better for him   effective  gradually getting there  looked into his eyes and thought  could help him and that what  trying    still has  contract  Lazio for another  years But  have  clause  take him  all about him proving  wants   what  says  want talented people around  and  want  work ethic  rub off  him  sure  will   lots  other people have been sure and they haven been right 

 the minute  don think  ever worked  hard  training  times  day and  hasn let  down for    days 

HUGE LAUGHTER

 Deep down  ain funny though You have  earn what you get You want respect you have  earn  Other managers get sacked left right and centre They may not have those principles  and good luck  them But you can run after these players wiping their backside But  hope more than anything that  can see him play for proper  promised his mum  would   best  help him  only had one player before  couldn help and that was Clark Carlisle and boy did  try 

What  brilliant player Ravel could   love his ability  might   and around   Saturday  see

 Who are the most exciting youth players coming through

  hard  say individuals  loaned out Shodipo  want him  learn  bit more make  few mistakes for someone else then come back Just like Furlong has done  has  serious chance though  great with the ball  his feet and running  people 

GregoCox and Petrasso have really impressed  Doughty has stacks  ability  just struggle  find  position for him Lumley has been outstanding they waxing lyrical about him down  Bristol Rovers Furlong and Manning have been amazing Everyone behind the scenes are working  hard  fantastic There others  really like the look  but they aren physically there yet

 Where does the club stand with  the discipline  Steven Caulker

 Not  employer  the world that would comment  that  internal and ongoing process  further comment

  seems  get  trouble when  not fit  would love   able  pick him   brilliant player  started the season  fire

 What happening with the outstanding bank loan

  being repaid monthly and finishes  August

 The interest rate seems quite high  what Reuben has paid into the club With parachute payments reducing why   taking money out  the club

   said earlier  will give you the same deal  you want

  think this   trust thing They had their hands burnt let  honest They now running QPR how they run their own businesses  trust them Les does Lee does These are nice people They got caught    before and thought that the way football was Reuben   quiet man who determined   well  doesn  into this   people   man  his word and  want   build  relationship and for    proud 

 not about what you spend you can  and have  lovely meal   café right  you choose  well Some are minging but some are nice

 know what you have here and  time this will give you what you want But  need trust They lost millions  millions  goal   make them feel happy and good who knows what comes then

 Could the club give  free tickets  local schools  the community for cup games  would help boost attendance and atmosphere

 The  give you very few tickets  give away free   the revenue goes    goes  the opposition and   the   crazy but even  you give the ticket away whether they show   not  then have  pay the opposition and the league  even  you aren getting any money for the tickets That why clubs don   anymore where  the past they included   the  price

 How good  Smithies

 WOW  played with some good goalkeepers but Smithies  phenomenal Ingram  excellent and never complains about lack  game time The way that they work  incredible  blessed with great goalkeepers here Lumley   mentioned  doing very well and  have  beast   lad  the youth team who looks  real prospect Smithies signed  new deal recently  imagine there will  offers for him this summer Gilks was outstanding for   Blackpool but Smithies  topping him and  younger Good job too because  never seen  many one  ones since  been here

laughter

 Have you worked much  the fitness The players looked noticeably sharper against Leeds

 Not  much but  have more desire now  did some running drills here and  was shocked Pawel got  the team because  how well  did  the best  ever seen Young Manning was the second best  ever seen    went too  quite simple really You need   able  run when playing counterattacking football 

Some people didn want  run some people couldn run Sandro hadn run for ages You can play counterattacking football with that But now they believe Luke Freeman blitzes what  had before All these elements come together and you get more energetic performances   result   long  Smith far too often for  but the players know  there   option

Birmingham away was the best  seen from any team  mine That was the day that the new boys came  age for  The pressing the desire the quality The free kick from Yeni unbelievable 

 Yeni  found out what weight  was before  came    fella who  bringing   the scouting knew his manager  Metz   knew  put   lot  weight  had  bereavement  lost his father  missed his flight and  the time  got there his dad had passed away How can you judge him  that

 knew his body fat was nowhere near right  showed him the calendar and said look  you there  that your twin brother You eating his biscuits  came  way and  worked ever  hard

laughter

 game  this league  easy  you think  will just show   Saturday and win then don come  they start moaning shut them  

 lost  Vauxhall Motors  terrible car  lost too  never forget that    mission  get you what you want 

Against Huddersfield  was sat there waiting for someone   something then Freeman smashed that one  and  almost got back into   want those moments  magic more

 Can someone tell our commercial man  cancel the Vauxhall sponsorship that  had lined 

laughter

Paul Morrisey then presented  couple  fans signed ball and another with   Rangers cash

Holloway went totally offpiste and said  should  more QPR cash  all home made Wouldn that  great  want   Rangers cash please  

Paul Morrisey then went back  Holloway  sign off the evening

superhoops," think  have  decent spine  the team But there are changes that  would make but not huge ones

  SmithiesIngramLumley  our three keepers   even   shift Smithies this summer  not that worried  set  the position 

  FurlongPerch    always confused when  don see Furlong name  the team sheet  should  one  the first  the list  consistent and shows  lot  promise plus his dad sits  the same block   But Perch keeps making mistakes and the more  watch him the more  scares   should  back   this point and that  

     starting pairing would  Hall and Nedum They been consistent players usually and  still think Hall  better   than  CDM although  not bad there either Ned  good and has had some great games  well   handful  total stinkers but  our big game defender  like Lynch but  think  been exposed  his relative lack  pace  watched him really get turned over  Bogle who   raw but very physical for example  keep them and add  extra  while getting rid  Caulker whom  like but  think  needs  fresh start where  can get his personal life  order 

  BidwellHamalainenRobinson  Another position where  think  set having  good mix  experience and youth  think Bidwell has proven   capable player  this level and doesn usually make mistakes  also like Robinson but  has had  torrid time with injuries which   shame  like Hamalainen seems quick and unafraid  push  had  very good cameo  Fulham  October  

  FreemanLuongoManningCousinsGossDoughtyBorysuikHenry   think Freeman has been  revelation His quick feet are  joy  watch and  been one  the players who seems  keep driving forward and  incredibly tricky  defend  this level  should  the star  the team really Luongo   player  admire  had  lot  shit  deal with  his short time  QPR but  battling midfielder and our best ball winner  his day Excited  see him develop more and with some consistency  selection can become  key cog next  Freeman Manning has also been  huge revelation this season young exciting and technically very good  hope  see him being  regular starter unless  does get shifted  the Prem  which case  wish him well Though   think another season  two here would  critical for his development   also  huge fan  Cousins who had  raw deal being shunted out wide  accommodate others during JFHs tenure  think  see  lot more from him  watched  fair amount  him when  was  Charlton  one   mates   fan and  think   another player who could  big for   has the engine works hard  young and has some crackers  him  seen very little from Goss  think   project needs  toughen   stick  this league but happy with the purchase should have resale value  the future   can live   his potential Doughty could   defensive sub who does lots  running and tackling   Ollie ever considered   don think  got   him  compete  this level but  could  wrong Borysuik  would like  see more  although  seems like Ollie does not like him Henry needs  leave was useful  while ago but limited and past  

  WashingtonSmithSyllaPetrassoMackieWszolekYeniShodipoLuaLua loanJET   have  interesting mix  forward and wingers here  would like  see Washington keep getting starts  idea why  was benched when  was hot  think  finally finding his feet  this level and  season where  plays  the out and out striker will  great Such  quick and tricky player  would like  see Smith  used  knock down balls for Conor not  the main plan    ugly Limited player but hard working and could  useful for  Sylla   interesting player Inconsistent but  his day his combination  speed and size make him dangerous Very good rotation option and  think the highest scoring bench player  the league this season Petrasso has shown glimpses over the past few seasons needs  run  games  see what  has like Manning got really not  minutes   wing back Mackie   fan favourite and has shown  still has   patches like when  played Reading away would keep him around   have already offered  contractWszolek   signing  the season technically  great player  bit slow but got  show what  can  and really happy with the signing Scored some nice goals too Yeni has finally found his feet after  rough start with his dad passing and Ollie calling him fat terrible man management and  excited  see what  can  now  knows his role and the English game LuaLua has shown some flashes might  worth signing him   can see Brighton needing him Shodipo shouldn have been loaned out   opinion one  our best wingers the kid puts   and was  bright spark   season  shite Did well  Port Vale apparently  think  time  put the JET experiment  bed hugely talented but not  great attitude  would like  see more  Morrison but  don know how that going  play out 

Loans  come back  Comley Osman Kakay Ben Gladwin  Khayati  Don know  lot about the youngsters but could still come good  would like  see Gladwin get another chance but that  and  Khayati should probably move   JFH man There are  couple  other youngsters who  have  idea about 


OUT  Caulker Henry Perch maybe Doughty JET  Khayati Smithies might  poached  Prem club

  Backup  maybe sign LuaLua   permanent backup 

 wouldn tinker lots   have consistent lineups  could  mid table but  don know  Ollie will  that   also  little fearful  what might happen  the transfer market after his comments  the last week  two  don think the club can  crazy spending wise yet with FFP still not being resolved but  would like  see  make  modest profit like last season  possible  get rid  Caulker wages  really depends  what the board decides the target  But those are  two cents  the teams and players",1212,2017-05-11

 The fact   you want  good proven name British striker  the Championship  the moment you have  pay more than QPR can afford Villa and Newcastle have inflated that  absolutely ludicrous levels and Derby paid nearly  for Vydra who scored five times  Holloway and supporters think Sylla isn good enough and needs   replaced with  proven Championship striker they dreaming   can afford one The other fact  whether his English  good enough  understand the wisdom Holloway and Bircham want  impart onto him  not the  bargain bucket African  picked  from Anderlecht has outscored almost all  the players other clubs paid astronomical money for  accomplished that   poor team which provides its strikers with shit service  his first year  the country  his first year  Championship football while being bounced  and out  the team and while having his manager publicly slagging him off

 may turn out   shit but QPR finances are forcing them  look for transfers like this more often whether  like   not and  far  been  success story  deserves far more respect than  getting  the moment   opinion

Discussing the transfer fee

Discussing player personal terms

Discussing agent fees

The agentplayer discussing all above three with multiple clubs  the same time  get the best deal

The selling club wanting  record the selling profit  the next fiscal year

The wanted player    holiday

Work permits

Registering the player  the squad

And just adding  this many clubs announce the signing the second they reach  agreement  transfer fee and personal terms  only transfer fee while  according  Lee Hoos  those financevideos announce the new player when absolutely every bit  deals permits and medicals are done  even   were progressing with transfers  wouldn know about  until the player  practically ready  play   league match

Sylla  arguably  better finisher than Matt Smith but offers little else   scored  goals   appearances   those are starts which   good return but can hold  play like Smith can and often goes missing for most  the game

Smith  much better  the air but   immobile that starting him means  are resigned  playing  direct style  play for the entirety      has  goals   but   those are off the bench

Shipping out players  big contracts  difficult but less  once they are  the final months  those deals From the perspective  both sides  agreement then becomes more straightforward because virtually any financial deal cut  order for the player   would represent  saving compared  paying his full wages for the remainder  the season

Regarding the youngsters Petrasso Lumley Dieng RGC Kakay Goss haven really seen enough   all  them  decide what their fate should  Shodipo was  good player for  when  played last season and  been suprised  hasn featured  all this season    not getting minutes here then possibly  loan deal Same goes for Goss Worked magic for Eze

From the more senior players definitely get rid  JET  point keeping him around Borysiuk already went  loan once and still hasn got  place  first team after his return   imagine    his way  well Same thing for Yeni   aren going  play with wingers sadly for him because  though  played okay last season  his correct position Next Caulker Got through  play  few matches but then suddenly found himself playing for the  team again Got   quite high paid  well  use for him IMO   can keep himself   condition  play regularly

Out  the players playing quite regularly regarding Onuoha and Perch  really depends  what sort  wages they are  atm Perch  okay and gets the job done but   means should  near  the highest paid players  the squad Onuoha    opinion  solid defender with loads  experience which our relatively young squad really needs Renew IMO unless the wages are too much Mackie   the same boat with these two good  have   backup with reasonable wages but sadly may  past his prime years

Selections  reasons

Smithies  real reasons needed here

Bidwell IMO  really solid  not  good wingback  Robbo plays   real competition for this position

Robinson One  our best players this season maybe switch  Lynch when opposing   side with big and tall forwards Also suprisingly good   despite only being introduced  the position this season

Onuoha Despite all the stick  gets  arguably our best defender Brings experience  the otherwise relatively young backline and the team  whole

Furlong Only real competition  Perch brings some threat going forward  well Maybe switch  Perch when some stability  needed with the cost  some pace

Luongo Picks himself

Scowen Picks himself

Eze Just looks better and better every time  watch him play  really exciting prospect who needs gametime and brings some unpredictability  the side along with Smyth Don know   familiar with playing  the wing  positioned him   part  the middle three Switch positions with Freeman when necessary

Freeman Picks himself switch with Eze when necessary Winger position make sense since  has the ability and skill  run  defenders and  arguably one  the best crossers and passers  the league

Sylla  really tough choice between him and Conor The striker position overall  the one  don really have  solid pick for Really depends  the opposition and   are going  press hard and counter Washington maybe Sylla some doubt  the pressing for him  just depend  crosses  the big man Smith Ollie should really  careful with when  start Matt because when doing that  loses one  our biggest assets from the bench Also with Smith  front  always end  hoofing the ball more than  like   certainly keep the starting striker selection mostly between Conor and Idrissa

Smyth  real prospect along with Eze Got past Derby experienced defence over and over again and created really good chances with some lovely turns and backheels Like Eze brings some unpredictability and flair  the side Only real current competition  Pav who sadly hasn reached last season levels this season which may well  because  the wingback position",392,2018-03-09

Also  bit offtopic but figured out this would probably   good place  ask since there are probably many people with similiar interests here  there are  few days without football  the fridaywednesday period  you especially londoners have any suggestions for things    London for  band  four male football fans apart from watching football   pub

 now signed

Luke Freeman  assist  goals last season need  say more

Josh Scowen allround solid midfielder who was wanted   clubs but decided  join 

Paul Smyth really exciting prospect and  full Northern Ireland international  the age  

Bright OsayiSamuel another exciting prospect who was part  winning promotion   with Blackpool

Toni Leistner statistically one  the best defenders you can find   Bundesliga wanted  Norwich Villa and Fulham but decided  join

 Who takes your penalties
 Who takes your direct free kicks
 Who takes your corners and indirect free kicks

  have  get some penalties first Connor Washington and Jake Bidwell took one each last season the latter missing  imagine that Washington will remain the first choice this season despite probably not being  the starting

 Indirect free kicks and corners are usually taken  Luke Freeman

Ebere Eze    
 has looked great when played   number  role when  behind  striker Nakhi Wells  Tomer Hemed but  been put  the right wing  lot which has left our right back exposed    Often drifts inside with Freeman doing the same  the left which makes  look like   and vulnerable  the counter That said   young player who has recently gotten  full run  games   has  lot  learn

Nakhi Wells and Tomer Hemed    
Really have made  difference for  although they haven been banging them  they have been putting other players into dangerous positions With  little bit more luck things could have gone our way  little more recently 

Luke Freeman    
 has looked  but definitely not  his best  late   opinion Often runs into dead ends and the final ball isn always great although his through balls with Wells pace have been very good and they have looked dangerous playing off  one another

General Tactics

 think tactically  struggle    square pegs round holes type  deal Luongo has been having  very poor season  central midfield has not had  single good game recently imo and paired  with Geoff Cameron there   real creativity  the centre  midfield

 think  change  formation may   some good   would allow Cameron  Scowen  drop   the defensive line making  easier for the right and left backs  close down the wide areas  would also put Eze  behind the  strikers where  thrives The midfield  would  Freeman and Luongo with Freeman playing the ball  either the strikers  Eze  the hole Wells has shown  really incredible workrate  getting back from what  have seen     dropping deep  get the ball then  still have Hemed   long ball option and Eze  start  counter attack higher  the pitch thus

The other option would   play   but with  out  out winger  the right Pawel Wszolek  Bright OsayiSamuel and Eze  behind the striker  top Either way the experimentation couldn really hurt  the current  system with both Hemed and Wells hasn been getting goals for either  them  goal   games between them  feel like this addresses our lack  creativity  midfield  Eze can drop  bit deeper and look for through balls  Freeman and Wszolek thus

But yeah  you want  get involved  the singing business then the block  definitely the place   personally  probably try out the block  the block side  the loft next time  fly over since  getting more familiar with the chants

From  tourist point  view  really had  trouble finding anything despite going alone you can even bring normal sized backpacks  long  you let the stewards check them

QPR Financial Reviewhttpfinancialfootballnewscomqprfinancialreviewffphits 
",14,2019-02-19
superhoops,"Joel Lynch  Not good enough for QPR and never has been Played his best football when  had Cameron sitting  front  him aside from that awful Makes  mistake every game costs  points  


Jake Bidwell  Overated Consistently average  the best compliment  give him Offers nothing but  good cross every now and then going forward doesnt offer anything defensively Not good enough  


Midfield  Mass Cousins and Scowen are all decent championship midfielders individually but  massively lack  experienced head  the middle  the park Unsuprising that our best run  form this season was when  had Cameron sitting  front  the back  Strong great interceptions experienced can pick  pass  


Lumley and Eze  Fans expecting too much too soon Lumley  great prospect fantastic shot stopper but needs  work  distribution and aerial ability Eze fantastic  the ball has the ability  glide past players and create space but needs  work  defensive discipline   only  years old Give these   break  


Matt Smith  Undeniably great  the air and  good asset  have  the squad For  you just cant start him  are  much better side when  get the ball down and play football Its  shame   got goals  him  just becomes very predictable and cant  done week  week out  


Wells and Hemed   have  proven championship strikers  our squad play them both while  can Admittedly Hemed has been injured but was initially dropped  accomodate Eze They both got goals  them why not play them together while  have can  honestly dont know what the plan  for next season but its worrying times with Matt Smith looking like our only striker next season  


Pawel  Not  wingback hes  right winger  causes every team problems running down the right flank when hes sat higher  Got  good cross  him and the odd goal Tracks back well and helps out his fullback but hes not  wingback Playing him  that role massively holds him back and you can see his frustration ",376,2019-02-19
superhoops,"Agree   Lynch  are miles better with Hall  the back  Bidwell  probably having his best season with  and has become  improved player over the years   think  more accurate description  him would  reliable and consistent  which  exactly what  need  the back  Now would Robinson have taken his place   had stayed Most likely    the weak leak  the defense right now Absolutely not   have  sort out the center back situation   has been our Achilles heel over the years  The last time  weren consistently shipping goals was when Dunne was  the squad

 put Scowen  the same boat  Lynch  had one good season under Holloway and now regularly sprays misplaced passes across the pitch  Cousins has been  injury prone let down since  came  the club  Interestingly  has probably shown his best form  the last few games and   can keep    could have  place  the squad yet

 been pleasantly surprised  Lumley especially after the two massive saves  made today but you are spot   your overall assessment  both him and Eze

Remember earlier  the season when  were playing Wells and Hemed but  were still losing  Maybe  could work again but  have tried  and  didn work   think  can all agree that Smith   limited footballer but  willing  give him  few more games paired  with either Wells  Hemed

Cameron and Rangel were the catalyst behind our ascendancy towards the tophalf  the table before Christmas   have struggled since they went out injured  However with the exception  Sheffield  have been missing out  points  slim margins and against good teams   cannot underplay the effect the transfer embargo and lack   budget has had  our ability  strengthen the squad  any way",340,2019-02-19

superhoops,"  our championship status  practically confirmed for the next season  thought  make  round  some matters such  the ever present talking point  our expiring contracts and offer some   thoughts Brace yourself this might  longish

Outgoings

Before  get  our expiring contracts  just like  make  point  our wage structure  small detail that amazed  was when Millwall was interested  loaning Smith but staggeringly weren able  afford his wages Just let that sink  Millwall like   not  club  very similar situation   can afford  loan  our reserve striker That made  wonder what are  paying  other players especially those that  signed shortly after our relegation   and  seasons  completely fine with Luongo potentially being one  our high earners since   top player but the thought that Joel Lynch could well  the best paid defender  our books really makes you think

That said the following players are out  contract this summer

Loans  Wells Cameron and Hemed end

Jake Bidwell  decent championship left back   opinion aged only  Transferred  from Brentford where  was  regular starter From  wage perspective surely there must have been  financial factor  play  abandon  regular starter position just  switch   rival club Obviously not sure what  actually paying him but from all the players out  contract  feel  might  the one with finances playing  big part  renewing

Joel Lynch Such  strange defender One moment  dancing take the  with Toni after popping  our second goal past Ipswich the next  making the same schoolboy errors again and again  our end resulting  conceding goals Hate  say this but   which should  the age  which defenders are  their prime and Joel prime  not really convincing   being honest Probably   expensive contract  well   was signed during our first season back  the champ Wouldn renew

Grant Hall and Jordan Cousins Very similar players with  horrendous injury history but both with potential   good championship players Jordan only  years old Grant  Tricky  say   should  shouldn renew Again will depend  wages but honestly have  idea Both have seemed like class players  they are anything like the short glimpses they offered   far but really can blame the club  they don renew either

Pawel Wszolek Transfermarkt says that  have  option for  further year  his contract  very average winger  attacking sense with excellent workrate defensively which  definitely his strong point Would renew unless  good alternative appears

Angel Rangel Stay Please   not for  playing role then  think  need  good seasoned pro who been there and done that  the Premier League   renew Darnell contract  imagine Angel would  really helpful for him with his experience

Darnell Furlong  decent enough young right back with  wealth  championship experience for his age Can imagine him being paid  fortune would renew

Potential transfers out

 say our most sellable player would  obviously Freeman  good player  doubt but  say  out  options    club comes calling with  decent bid and wages combination from both players and clubs point  view Hard  tell who actually good  this current form   Doubt Eze will  anywhere  the summer after his dip  form

 been reading about Joe Lumley being linked with Bristol City   opinion   excellent player who not being really talked about especially  there seem   not that many young English goalkeepers around  the Championship Wouldn sell  think  played  major part  our improved clean sheet amount even   been exposed  highly questionable defensive work  times

Potential loans depend highly  players  manage  bring    not going  write about those

Potential transfers 

 striker Probably almost  certainty  bring  striker  for next season Can see  relying  Oteh and Smith with the former being really inexperienced   the number one striker and the latter being rather one dimensional even    good goalscorer  any Championship strikers seem   valued   basis     goal scored  don think   able  bring  anyone from the championship  like  see   for strikers outside the  also considering that championship clubs can offer decent wages compared  many other smaller European first tier leagues

Defenders based highly  whose contracts  renew This   area  like  good experienced championship centerback  play with Leistner Also maybe slightly more attacking alternatives  fullback areas  especially Bidwell isn excactly lightning fast

 definitely fine  the midfield area can see any movement there unless someone  sold

Wingers maybe When the loan players return there  Smyth Wszolek BOS Freeman Shodipo and Wheeler That  decent amount but might need  strengthen  Luke  sold

 you took your time  read this far  salute you Just needed  open  somewhere",923,2019-04-19
superhoops,Solid assessment   keep Hall for sure and offload Cousins   probably need  bring     central midfielder and  striker for next season,27,2019-04-19
superhoops," thought the club was slowly trying  sort out the wage structure but after hearing what Wells Hemed and Cameron might   all rumours admittedly  really have  idea about the finances  the club

Looking  the squad list  the website these are the players that  reckon should leave

Ingram Gotta   think Didn cover himself  glory and might  well give his spot   youngster Hopefully can rejuvenate his career somewhere else

Lynch   means  can sign someone else  like  see him  Like you said not reliable enough and could    big wage   don have anyone  the horizon  guess  have  keep him though

Freeman Our best player but  need the cash  strengthen the team

Wheeler Not much point keeping him unless  going  play him  


With the loanees also going this would  our strongest team without signings

Lumley Rangel Hall Leistner Bidwell Wszolek Luongo Scowen BOS Eze Smith

This  very weak side and would probably get relegated  Hall can get back  playing well that help  out but this window  need  least    unless Manning can play there discussed  Loft For Words    and   well   manager  course

Analysis

Defense Left back has  cover and thus  should prioritize signing Bidwell    reliable and rarely injured   centre back  also run into problems    not sign Hall and Baptiste  Hall seems   past his extensive knee problems and both have performed consistently well  recent years  Not only that but Baptiste can provide cover anywhere across the back line  Lynch should  let   Between his constant injury problems and lack  quality   simply not good enough    worth considering retaining Rangel  the price  right   can provide good experience  Furlong but   getting  there  age and there are questions around whether  can stay fit    can keep Bidwell Hall and Baptiste  should still consider signing another 

Potential Signings criteria being out  contract under  likely improvement 

 Jonas Knudsen Ipswich Out  Contract Martin Olsson Swansea Out  Contract Joe Mattock Rotherham Out  Contract

 Mike van der Hoorn Swansea Out  Contract Yoann Barbet Brentford Out  Contract Mark Beevers Bolton Out  Contract Michael Ihiekwe Rotherham Out  Contract

Midfield Both wings seem  good hands especially   prioritize signing Wszolek with the option for another year  his contract   lack depth  central midfield  Goss returns from his loan but there  little confidence   worth  spot  the first team  Cousins has been injury prone and also lacking  quality  his time with QPR and should  released   will likely need two new players   confident  our depth  this position  There  talk that Freeman could  sold off   Premier League club next season and  could definitely use that transfer fee  finance the purchase  several players  What  more  that even  Freeman was    would still have plenty  depth  attacking midfield

Potential Signings  Markus Henriksen Hull Out  Contract Alan Browne Preston Out  Contract Lewis Wing Middlesbrough Out  Contract Lewis Macleod Brentford Out  Contract 

Striker    not sign Wells permanently and   very unlikely that  will  will surely need  bring another striker into the team   should definitely work Oteh into the team off the bench but   team  still struggle  find  true striker since Austin left the team many years ago

Potential Signings  going over  years old here Fraizer Campbell Hull Out  Contract David McGoldrick Sheffield United Out  Contract Lee Gregory Millwall Out  Contract Freddie Sears Ipswich Out  Contract

 Current depth

Toni Leistner   Current captain  the club  feel Leistner first season  English football was  partial success standing    was  decent threat  the air  corners winning  aerials per game this threat  the box was displayed  our home  draw with Reading where  hit the crossbar twice From  defensive stand point Leistner was decent winning  tackles and interceptions per game However where  excelled was  the clearance department where  made  clearances per game   the league Overall Leistner looked  solid addition  the squad and was proven   our best defender  the squad

Yoann Barbet   New signing from rivals Brenford Barbet looks    great coup   free transfer due  his versatility and consistency  Centre half for Brentford over the last four years where  made  appearances  the league Barbet   there with the best ball playing Centrebacks  the league Barbet played  key passes per game season whereas Adam Webster played  per game However despite being    isn  great  the air  you want   Centre half only winning  aerial duels per game

Grant Hall   Having struggled with  knee injury over the last two seasons Hall will  looking  come back into the first team this coming season Hall seemed   one  the best defenders  the club before his injury and  had some decent performances  the closing stages  last year including his composed performance against Watford  the  round  the  cup  will  interesting  see  Hall can return  full fitness and  turn become  key figure  the team again

Additionally one  our  players could fill   Centreback  need  Giles Phillips  was  the bench when  lost   Derby last season whereas Charlie Rowan  and Ben Wells  have both came for respected Premier league academies  Watford and West Ham However   still feel there  room for  additional Centre half and   looked  some potential transfers

superhoops,"Probably  bit long and  structure   but here you 

Our dalliance  the Premier League wasn good for the club  both Harry Redknapp and Mark Hughes spent millions  players giving them high salaries without actually thinking about how  put them  the team  whether they actually wanted  play for the club

This financially crippled  and relegation with the lack  guaranteed income  pay these players has impacted the team ever since  have had  sell players when  could and essentially buy  the cheap 

There are two things that have been very important  the last couple  years with QPR  parachute payments and Financial Fair Play FFP Parachute payments refer  money that teams relegated from the Premier League receive  believe for  years after relegation They ensure that teams don immediately  under due  high wages The payments hav just run out for QPR but unfortunately during those  years the club didn really adjust well enough This led   letting our club captain Nedum Onuoha  for free  year ago   couldn afford his wages and means that  selling players for usually  lot less than they worth   need the money and often need  get rid  players FFP also has  bearing here Financial Fair Play  complicated but can essentially  boiled down  spending reasonably within your means QPR haven done this and have been fined and threatened with the loss  points The club has  tiny income and therefore FFP has also led  pressure and  need  sell players

With all that financial fun  led   team that hasn really got very good players   needed  pick them   the cheap There are still some shining lights Luke Freeman  our best player   mile Massimo Luongo   Australian international who can  great but  inconsistent and Eberechi Eze   fantastic prospect Freeman and Luongo might  gone this month  next though haha

With the manager Warburton seems like  good recruitment There weren many good options for QPR   don have the best reputation  the moment lots  managers have come and gone recently there not really any money Warburton  great  setting  scouting networks  has  clear tactical preference and  had success  the division before Judging him  our signings  far this season  been very sensible got  some solid players and  got rid   few players that  didn really need  positive  far

 are not aiming for promotion  all  the moment  the team just isn  the right place financially    honest mentally  finished poorly  the league  the last  seasons and the best hopes are for  midtable finish and  bit  respectability restored Hopefully Warburton can use this season  set some groundwork  build upon for the future and grow the club but with QPR recent luck  not gonna get  hopes  just yet",538,2019-07-02

superhoops," having watched every available pre season friendly from the   thought  make  post  some patterns  personally noticed about how Mark wants   kick the ball about   thought  might  useful  someone hasn been able  watch the matches

Formation

 mostly played     whatever you like  call   back four midfield three including one mid sitting just  front  the back four one box  box midfielder  bit further forward and one more attacking mid who still drops quite deep when needed Two wingers and  striker obviously 

 example lineuphttpsreddkjjdeqxwwvcpng

amp

Attacking play

Probably the most noticeable aspect  the very high tempo whether  means running down the wing like  madman  passing the ball about   quick fashion Much emphasis  wingers  take their man  but also  fullbacks  overlap  provide  safe secondary option for the winger The high tempo applies also  aggressive pressing immediately after losing possession where furthest midfield two join   well  imagine  important form  scoring goals this season will  getting  the end  crosses whether    shooting  heading the ball into the net 

Keeping possession

 can  the only one who gets shivers down their spine when they hear playing from the back combined with QPR Anyway that what Mark trying   and  has looked okay IMO Get used  our  rolling the ball out quite  lot instead  trying  thump  for  opposition goal kick The key will  whether Barbet Hall and Leistner   stays are good enough  the ball Barbet has seemed very confident but Hall having been out for  long has understandably looked  bit off the pace here and there Leistner  our best defender  terms  pure defending IMO but hard  tell   fit into Mark system 

Defending

Keeping possession  very closely knitted  this section The style Mark apparently wants  that the first though will   try  work our way out  the situation  keeping the ball  the ground and potentially starting  quick attack Otherwise defending  defending and there  much more  can say about this matter

Potential issues

There  doubt that when Mark tactics work  will look very pleasing  the eye and  effective  the pitch But what are the main points where this style has  chance  coming short with the players  have

 Counter attacks Everyone who has watched even one  the friendlies must have seen this The flip side  having overlapping full backs  the huge space they leave behind them which has been utilised  nearly all  our oppositions resulting  several    situations The key here   have proper knowledge  what the other  players have   when  fullback goes   run  that you can have even  partial coverage  the defensive third
 Situational knowledge  other words when  clear the ball  row  and when  keep   the ground for  potential counter attacking chance Whether  pass the ball back  order  retain possession   attempt  cross that might result   attack your way There have been  few occasions just the latest one today when  attempted  play ourselves out   too tricky situation which for example resulted today  giving possession away  our own box   very dangerous position This will probably take some time  get properly fixed but hoping that  doesn lead  too many opposition goals 
 Reliance  crosses What  the opposition has such  good backline that our wingers can get into good crossing positions  our forwards just can get into end  the crosses Can say  passed our way through the middle too many times yet but hoping that    needed they can   

All  this being said Pugh Kane and Hugill are very good signings who will surely come  handy and can wait  get ourselves  winning start  Stoke  Saturday You ",733,2019-07-27

superhoops,"Agree with  lot  this   the first point Hugill will provide much improved finishing than exactly  His strike rate  his  apps for Middlesbrough last season was about  goal per  shots   his best season with Preston   his strike rate was about the same   put that into perspective Wells strike rate for  was about  goal per  shots

 the topic  our youngsters  With the exception  Furlong  actually saw quite  number  youth products  the pitch against Watford    fan  this club there   certain element  love that clouds  judgement when  comes  players who have come through our academy  that were snapped   teenagers  Particularly with these types  players they want  play for the badge and they might even love QPR  much     When  lose these types  player  hurts more than usual  Take Harry Kane for example  loves Tottenham   always wanted  play for Tottenham and that quality allows the team   whole  punch above their weight  there   reduced risk  Kane wanting  move  another club  The point isn that Kane and Furlong are similar  ability they aren but that players who have loved their club since childhood can have  major impact  the team overall

Joe Lumley who has been with QPR since  was   starting regularly for the first team  Ilias Chair came    year old two years ago   anyone watched the last  minutes against Watford you know that Chair showed real desire and almost produced the goods  two occasions   could have  breakout season  Ryan Manning also came  the club   year old four year ago and has seen  significant uptick  first team appearances   fact  appears locked into the left back role and could continue even when Wallace returns from injury  Eberechi Eze came here   year old three years ago and  clearly locked into the first team  Finally  have Olamide Shodipo  who  been  big fan  throughout his time here who came  the club   year old seven years ago   has historically had back luck with injuries but  seen the most out  him this preseason and  appears  factor into Warburton plans  All  all   exciting  see this many youngsters figure into the first team and shows that there  development going  within the youth ranks",443,2019-07-29

superhoops,"  this what  been saving our transfer fee for this window

His  season review  Aberdeen

 bracket the defender  the best young Scot  have emerged  the Premiership this season would not  overstating the point Quite simply the yearold has been sensational since stepping  against Motherwell  September Powerful quick good  reading the game and with the knack for  goal  remember his howitzer against Kilmarnock  McKenna has  all And can still get better  
  
McInnes rates him massively and booted out three bids from Hull City  the January window before McKenna signed  new deal taking him through    
  
One criticism that could  levelled against the defender   has failed  deal with the threat  Celtic and Rangers but that  more  collective than individual criticism and legendary Dons defender Alex McLeish has made him  first pick  his newlook Scotland side The   defender was man  the match  Tuesday night win  Hungary

From  best defenders  SPL article

The young defender   reminder that regardless  how much you study and dissect football  will always present you with things you just didn see coming  
  
This time last year the centreback had only recently completed  disappointing loan spell with Ayr United where McKenna had long been relegated  the bench for some erratic play including  brutal challenge  John McGinn   Scottish Cup defeat  Easter Road With little sign   firstteam place  Pittodrie  the horizon  was facing  uncertain future   couldn hack   the Scottish Championship level then what kind  career did that leave  
  
 the end  needn have worried Pitched into the starting  this season  add  bit more steel  the Aberdeen defence  place  Mark Reynolds McKenna impressed  the  win Soon the oneoff success became  good month then  good few months and now  great first season which has been rewarded with  Young Player  the Year nomination and international honours  
  
Physically  everything you could ask for   central defender Broad tall robust and doesn run like  towing  tractor But what been most impressive  his consistency There have been  couple  shaky performances  late  most notably  the Scottish Cup semifinal defeat  Motherwell  but overall  made very few mistakes  undoubtedly been the club best defender this term and arguably their best player

With  caps for Scotland   years old McKenna would   fantastic signing  Prying him away from Aberdeen will  the hard part  Would likely have  pay upwards   million  Could potentially sell   few years for twice that    like the strategy  trying  make one big signing with  transfer fee though",500,2019-07-30

superhoops,"Firstly  think you need some context about football  Finland  general First  all football isn really  popular sport  watch here  pretty staggering example  that   university class  approx  engineering students read   young men   the only one who follows football apart from watching the champions league and the world cup finals when they  

This lack  interest  domestic  european football allowed    without watching  SINGLE FOOTBALL MATCH until the  world cup during which  got  know  few guys  school who followed football  bit more Even after that world cup all  really did was play  bit  Fifa now and then

This  where QPR comes  play You know when you have  select  favourite team when you create your Fifa account Not really knowing anyone outside the top  but still having  usual mindset  supporting the underdog  thought  myself Nah let  with this team called QPR  think  can still change  later   didn really think about   this  the team  support   honest  not sure   even intended  really support anyone  that point But boy only   knew what  had just signed  for  think  watched  first match because  found Charlie Austin hanging aroung the top scorer charts  the league interesting especially  QPR were   relegation battle  was  huge cluster   being  underdog   city with  many huge football clubs  ridiculously small  capacity stadium and  relegation battle Definitely not everyone cup  tea but  found  really appealing

The final nail  the coffin was when  visited London with  family  summer    even had  apartment  west London  walking distance away from  Because  was summertime  never got   match and even the new kit wasn released until the next week but all  got was  QPR coffee mug and  scarf from the hilariously named superstore   that wasn enough the Shepherds Bush area really seemed and still seems like  place where normal people live and  found the area really nice

The next  season  went  complete the military service that  obligatory here but surprisingly got  know two guys who followed football and supported City and Liverpool sigh who got  know more about QPR during that year than they probably ever would have  listened  Finney and  QPR podcast   journeys there and back but that was about   terms  following outside Twitter

 season  got the audio pass and followed   lot more than the previous season purely for the fact that  spent  weekends  home instead    foxhole with  assault rifle The first game   was  first live match  win against Reading and more staggeringly  Washington brace after which  had just introduced myself   very expensive hobby  travelling  the  every year  watch  match  two

 you had told  six years ago   spending  ridiculous amount   week watching  following some shite FOOTBALL TEAM from West London  wouldn have believed you but here   thinking   will start with Rangel  Kane next weekend having just finished booking  trains  the airport  fly over for the Cardiff  and Blackburn  double next month YOU SSSS",626,2019-09-12

First   have  simple graph  our wage bill blue and our place  the table red   far  the wage bill goes you can see  start off relatively modestly then balloon into  unsustainable mess  soon   made   the Premier League   the end  the  season when  were relegated  dropped the wage bill  almost  million  the start  the  season   have since spent the last three years reducing the wage bill even further   the end  the day  are only  few million over from where  started almost  decade ago

Next   have  graph that  think corroborates Ferdinand line that the club  heading  the right direction Basically this graph  saying How efficient are  with our wage bill  relation  where  finished  the table  The higher the value the better     were very efficient ultimately achieving promotion   modest  million   our Premier League days our efficiency takes  turn for the worst  Our wage bill balloons   but our place  the table  rooted squarely  the relegation zone  Since our return  the Championship  have trended towards   our efficiency making headway  becoming the club  were  decade ago

With football around the world being brought   halt due  the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and the growing uncertainties about how this season will  played out  have decided  take  upon myself  review the current squad and analyse how  may progress   the next season with certain transfers

 will try  keep possible transfer targets  realistic  possible   this  have attempted  adhere  what  believe  Mark Warburton transfer policies

amp

Mark Warburton transfer policies

 Tends  buy  mix  young players and older experienced players
 Often purchases players who  has previously managed players from Brentford Rangers amp Nottingham Forest
 Often purchases players from Scotland Premier League youth teams and Lower English leagues
 Favours players with resell value

Goalkeepers

Liam Kelly 

Seems  have been  astute signing  around  Kelly has had  mixed season  far the Scottish keeper had  slow start failing  keep  clean sheet   games however following his penalty saving heroics against Leeds Kelly has kicked  and has shown how good  can actually  keeping  clean sheets  the  games following the initial drought Although what makes Kelly stand out from the other keepers  his ball playing ability  has  impressive  pass success whilst accurately playing  long passes per game this along with  impressive  saves  the penalty box per game which  the joint  best  the league suggests that  has  successful future with the   
  
Verdict  Keep first choice keeper

amp

Seny Dieng 

Having signed for  back   Dieng has not yet appeared for the first team however  feel  may finally get  chance  get some game time next season   has impressed  his loan out  Doncaster Rovers  has kept  very impressive  clean sheets   appearances  League One this along with  great pass success rate   suggests that  can fit straight into  Warburton passing style  play  
  
Verdict  Keep back keeper

amp

Joe Lumley 

Having joined the club   youth player   Lumley has had  very mixed career  far  the club having impressed last season keeping  imposing  clean sheets  his first full season  the main goalkeeper this form lead  him being rumoured   joining either Bristol City  Aston Villa but  course these moves never came  fruition and Lumley stayed This season has been  polar opposite  the last though Lumley has costed   multiple occasions suffering  huge  errors leading  goals This along with his failure  adapt   passing style  play leads   believe that Lumley could   his way out  
  
Verdict  Sell  loan out",511,2020-04-26
superhoops," not sure about Kelly  like  see Dieng given  chance  first choice keeper  not convinced with Kelly ability   the basics like shotstopping and commanding his area 

 does the more eyecatching things well  agree But what  really miss about Smithies  his reliability  didn tend  question whether  should have saved shots With Kelly and Lumley  often wonder  they should have saved  the near post got down  that shot tipped that over the bar had  stronger hand  that shot And     might his teammates which isn great for morale

Right Back

 become apparent throughout the season that Warburton wants our team  play similar  how his previous sides have played with   formation that has both full backs being able  attack and defend effectively

amp

Current squad depth

Angel Rangel 

Upon signing  oneyear contract extension Rangel has continued how  left off last season  has been  fairly competent defender performing  tackles and  interceptions per game whilst putting out  average  key passes and dribbles per game The veteran has shared games with new signing Todd Kane who appears   worse defensively than Rangel With his contract expiring  the end  June and Rangel not getting younger turning   November  could appear that his time with the  could   however  feel that Rangel  fit enough  fill   Right Back  need  next season and  could   vital role model  younger players  the team  
  
Verdict  Keep One year extension with role  coach offered  end

amp

Todd Kane 

Having signed   free from Chelsea  the summer Kane had high expectations  fill the void left  the departing Darnell Furlong however  wide range  fans have agreed that  hasn been   the mark this season and despite playing more progressive passes than Rangel with  key passes per game Kane only completes  dribbles per game the same  Grant Hall and less than Connor Masterson Moreover  has been poor defensively constantly giving the ball away being disposed  times per game Personally  wouldn mind  Kane leaves and   can get  decent amount  money  would take that   instance  
  
Verdict  Sell  possible

amp

Osman Kakay   Out  loan  Patrick Thissle

Having been playing  the Scottish division this season   unable  obtain stats  assess how well Kakay has done however going  his limited playing time  the first team  previous seasons  has appeared   able  perform well  the Championship  seems like Patrick Thisle fans have been happy with his performances going off responses  twitter  
  
Verdict  Keeploan out

amp

Potential transfers

Joshua Emmanuel   Bolton  Valued  around  with contract expiring  June

Would  quite  low risk transfe with his age and  being  free transfer Emmanuel only moved  Bolton  the summer   free from Ipswich but has impressed this season performing  respectful  tackles and  interception per game whilst only getting dribbled past  times per game the second best for right backs  the league Emmanuel doesn only excel defensively though  has completed  dribbles per game the most for  right back  league one and also carries out  decent  key passes per game

amp

Callum Brittain    Dons  Valued  around  with contract expiring  June

Another low risk transfer    young and would   free transfer Brittain   better passer  the ball than Emmanuel providing  key pass per game with  overall pass success    also completes  great  dribbles per game However Brittain isn  good defensively only putting out  tackle and  interceptions per game this may  due  him playing various positions  the pitch however

amp

Moses Odubajo   Sheffield Wednesday  Valued  around  with contract ending  June

Odubajo has been unlucky with injuries throughout his career  was arguably the best Championship right back  the league  his promotion season with Hull City and was also one  the best upcoming youth talents  the league with Brentford  the  season under Warburton This season  has been great defensively with  tackles and  interceptions per game going forward however Odubajo has struggled only producing  key passes and only completing  dribbles per game Odubajo would   risky transfer due  his injury history but with his past relationship with Warburton and the fact that this would   free transfer could make this  worthwhile deal

amp

Perry    Crewe Alexandra  Valued  around  with contract ending  

 far the best Right back  League Two this season  has been brilliant defensively executing  tackles most  league and  interceptions per game  most  league  has also been great going forward providing  goals and  assists aswell  providing  key passes most  league and  dribbles per game most  league The fact that  has  playing  League Two may bring suspension   whether  could make the jump  two levels  the Championship however there have been many players that have adapted  this jump  recent years these include Adam Webster Matt Grimes and Ollie Watkins

The makeshift Left back  the end  last season Manning has performed well  his first full season  full back this season  has been great going forward scoring twice and providing  assists  has produced the highest amount  key passes  the league from left back with  per game and also has completed  dribbles per game  respectable amount However despite stats suggesting Manning has been great defensively with  tackles and  interceptions per game  has been inconsistent defensively  parts Manning has been linked with moves away from the   Premier League teams but  feel unless  can get  decent fee above the reported   should keep him

Verdict  Keep first choice Left Back

amp

Lee Wallace 

Due  injuries Wallace didn make his league debut  left back until midDecember this had led  him falling behind Manning  the pecking order Despite this Wallace has been consistent  Left back and  decent left sided Centre back   back  defensively  has made  tackles  interceptions and  clearances per game However going forward Wallace has struggled only producing  key passes and completing  dribbles per game With his contract ending next summer  shouldn  rushing  give the aging injury prone player  contract extension anytime soon

Verdict  Keep back  Left Back and Centre Back

amp

Niko Hämäläinen   Out  loan  Kilmarnock

Hämäläinen has been out  loan  Scotland this season and has seemingly performed well according  the Kilmarnock fans  social media  has performed well going forward providing  assists but there aren any stats available  analyse how  played defensively With his contract expiring  June  should move fast  extend   ensure  don lose  potential talent   free   manage  get him  sign  new contract  can expect Hämäläinen  play sporadically throughout the season   could fill  for Manning who can also play  the midfield and Wallace who  injury prone and can play  Centre Back

Verdict  Keep extend contract",1410,2020-04-29
superhoops,"Encouraging that there quite  few decent fullbacks coming available  definitely struggled  bit with right back and  looks likely  might lose Manning  like Kakay   given  bit   chance but interesting  see what Warburton thinks  him 

Thanks for these write ups Really enjoyed them",54,2020-04-29
superhoops," definitely agree regarding Manning  has really grown into his role and  think will only get better going forward  has been  QPR for  years and  still only

superhoops,"Welcome You need  know about the  season where QPR beat Leeds  Loftus Road  their final match    point ahead  Liverpool  the top  the English Football League Sadly Liverpool still had one game  play away  relegation threatened Wolves and due  Liverpool European commitments  was not played until ten days later For those ten days little QPR were Champions  England And when  was finally played Wolves scored first and held  until  mins from the end when Liverpool equalized and then went   score two more  claim the  title Most players from that team are considered QPR legends  was something like this   Phil Parkes   Dave Clement   Ian Gillard   Terry Venables   Frank McLintock   David Webb   Dave Thomas   Gerry Francis   Don Masson   Stan Bowles   Don Givens   Mick Leach

 also watch the four year plan  amazon prime   fly  the wall documentary about the club current ownership before our current owners and the circus that QPR was between  and 

Generally   club known for finding and developing unknown young players and selling them onto bigger clubs for  profit whilst playing attractive attacking football and  have  history for maverick attacking midfielders who wear the  shirt Stan Bowles Adel Taaeabt Rodney Marsh Eze

 the last decade our current owners tried changing this  spending big  established stars and  didn really work and got the club into  lot  debt Since our last relegation from the premier League and the appointment  former star striker Les Ferdinand  director  football  tried   back  the old ways  developing unknown players with mixed results but  seen real progress this season under Mark Warburton management

superhoops, QPR fans approve  Mark Warburton Manager Approval Ratings Week ,12,2020-06-26
superhoops," love these types  threads thanks for the contribution

The financial position  our club means  lose  lot  players  should otherwise have kept  push   The likes  Smithies Luongo Freeman Furlong and now Hall just  name  few   also means  can afford  sign players like Nahki Wells  Frankly   depressing   remember  the  Francis said  leave the club   started selling our stars  Now  are  selling club   worry about our ambitions

 the other hand Hoos has straightened out financially  few clubs before  who are all  the Premier League now   the last decade  managed  reduce our wage bill substantially and  the process become somewhat financially sustainable  Important  look  both sides  the coin  suppose

 far   goes  disagree that Manning has been defensively poor this year  Arguably  think  has been one  our top three players this season behind Eze and Bright   really don see  bringing  another  unless Manning  sold  the window  His contract    the end  next season   surely  saleable asset and   unlikely our finances will allow him  resign  This means that  could lose him along with Eze and Bright this transfer window  Better  sell them though than get nothing but the lack  continuity will make next season that much more difficult

   have Rangel along with Kakay and Kane  Rangel age means his time  the team  limited   don see either   big  priority    Losing Hall  definitely  blow  the team  From what  seen  Masterson  could have  regular place  the team but   young  Barbet has been inconsistent this year but has shown flashes  ability that leave  feeling hopeful    the depth that  the problem woefully   Bringing  another    deal and potentially another  loan must   priority

  another area where  signing will   priority  Ball and Cameron can   job but  need more quality and youth

Striker  the last position that  would say   absolute priority  Thankfully with transfer money incoming from the sale  Eze and maybe others  may finally  able  invest  some quality players

Mostly  agree with you just trimmed out  and  from the list  priorities which will hopefully add more focus  our transfer window

Potential candidates all contract expiring end  season

superhoops,"After the past  performances  thought  breakdown how  see the current squad and plans for next season  


   all know Lumley  error prone and cost  points  the start  the season For  the jury  still out  Kelly  had some good performances and was quick  come out today against Charlton but  cant help but feel like  has  mistake  him  would probably look for  keeper  the next window Not Joe Hart  left Man City because  couldnt play football with his feet and thats exactly what Warburton will expect from him Disaster waiting  happen and wages will  too high  


   priority Manning has had some good performances this season but defensively  been consistently poor  dont think there been  winger this season that hasnt turned him inside out  some stage  the game  has  great left foot and puts  some great crosses  his day but defensively its  disaster Havent seen too much  Wallace but its clear  coming towards the end  his career and  prone  injury  


   priority Rangel been  great servant and somehow still puts   shift   years  age  concern  that  gets  the team ahead   year old Todd Kane who signed   year deal with   the start  the season  years and  has looked nothing short  hopeless every time  has played Maybe  needs  run  games  get some momentum going but  god  doesnt look promising  hear lots  talk about Kakay but  think part  going down the academy route  recognising that not every player that comes through will make  and not every player  good enough  naturally look  him  the  that has been been through our system and had loans etc but  personally dont think  good enough  


   priority  like Barbet when  alongside someone that can  the dirty work Classy player  his day and his left foot  great but  think  needs  experienced head  his side  compliment his ball playing style When you put Masterson next  him  just looks  bit   shambles although   think Masterson has  future  the club Hall had his injury problems but was  good   this level when fit  played  games this season and   big loss for these last few games  


When the assessment  that Barbet  the only player  would start  our back  next season its  suprise that  concede  many goals and look  poor  the back Shambles  


   priority  cant make  mind   Dom Ball  Luke Amos Both have shown glimpses  what they capable  but equally have had some  poor performances this season  think they both make good squad players but   being perfectly honest  just dont think they good enough  start   want  push for top half and the top   can understand Geoff signing  new deal   experienced head and clearly has quality even though its fading Another problem area for   


CAM     grouped these positions together because its clear under Warburton that the   them rotate and are expected   competent  each  the  positions Recruitment here  obviously dependent  what happens with Eze and Bright Assuming that  lose them both which  looking increasingly likely based  Les and Lee recent interviews then this becomes  priority area for  but for now its definitely our strongest area  like Chair and think  has  big future ahead  him  has  part  play over the next few seasons and hopefully fulfills his potential  


   priority  actually think Hugill   good striker  this level  never make   the premier league because  clearly lacks composure and loves  miss  sitter That being said  finds himself  the right places and always has  goal  him with the right players behind him West Ham will want money for him that  definitely wont and shouldnt pay   think   parting ways  the end  the season Yet again this leaves  light  this position  sound like  broken record with Oteh  the only recognised striker  the club Oteh for   similar  the Kakay situation  clearly not good enough  goal   appearances  Walsall and  goals   appearances  Bradford just doesnt cut   all for promoting youth and looking  the academy but part  that  accepting that some players arent good enough  


 the conclusion  that  would buy  new      and  The only positions  feel  though  strong are the front  behind the striker but thats including Eze and Bright who are inevitably leaving What does this mean Another rebuild  


  with rebuilding  long  this time its done with more quality  signed  players this season for just  which  paper  fantastic business When you assess the likes  Dom Ball Marc Pugh Liam Kelly Geoff Cameron etc based  what they came  for then you can call  good business But   really want  push   greater things now then the money  sell Eze and Bright for MUST  invested  the squad  dont have faith that the club will get  lot  money for the pair  them  hypothetically lets say  make  from their sales Even  only half  that  invested  the squad its significantly more than the  spent this season  dont want  hear excuses from the board next season   lose our star players well  was always going   harder after losing the likes  Eze and Bright The narrative  have been sold  that  make  revenue from ticket sales  our transfer business must  funded  player sales Next season will  the first for  long time that  have made considerable money from player sales and the board should  judged accordingly  understand FFP and  like that  are trying   more sustainable but there   excuse for not investing  the squad next season Here hoping that  see some progress although  have little faith",1158,2020-06-27
superhoops, think  should really  less   priority than some  the other more pressing needs   others have said  think Kelly   decent enough Championship starter provided the defense  strengthened   also read  lot  good things about Seny Dieng  loan right now  Doncaster   you can get  quality option for free obviously you consider  but  don think  too big   concern going into next season,80,2020-06-27

Current squad depth

amp

Yoann Barbet 

From his first appearance   preseason friendly against Austria Vienna  was apparent how great   passer Barbet was performing diags across the pitch with immense precision This ability  shown  how  has played the most accurate long passes  per game for  centre half  the league this  done whilst maintaining  great  pass success overall There was early worries about Barbet diving  needlessly  the box and giving away penalties however these soon subsidised when his defensive prowess was shown putting out  tackles and  immense  interceptions per  minutes His importance  the squad became evident when  was away injured with Barbet  the squad  have maintained   win percentage and without  have  measly  win percentage accentuating his prominence  the squad  
  
Verdict  Keep first choice Centre Back

amp

Connor Masterson 

Another great coup from the summer Masterson failed  make  first team appearance  the league until January however  has been impressive  most games  played thus far playing  average   passes per game with  astounding  accuracy Despite this Masterson hasn displayed the best defensive stats only making  tackles and interceptions per  minutes regardless  these statistical shortcomings Masterson hasn been dribbled past  his  minutes  game time this stat could  wrongly calculated though   appears that  was dribbled past  the lead   Barnsley goal  our first game back  seems Masterson has  great future ahead  him and  should look  pin him down   long term contract with his current one ending    
  
Verdict  Keep play sporadically  back 

amp

Toni Leistner 

Last season captain Leistner was one  our only consistent performers last term and  has impressed when  played this season however Leistner has made  evident that  doesn want  return  play for the  and therefore  should look  get rid  him  the transfer window The German Centre half was linked with  move  Aston Villa for around   the summer but now with only  year left  his contract  would  happy with  fee around   
  
Verdict  Sell

amp

Other players

Joe Gubbins  has been  and around the first team training throughout the year and  appears that  may   line  make  first team appearance before the end  the season

Themis Kefalas  has been out  loan  Billericay  the Vanarama National league south this season  has played well according  fans

amp

Potential transfers

With the recent departure  Grant Hall and the imminent departure  Toni Leistner  would appear that  may enter the summer transfer window with only two first team Centre backs This   course  huge issue and  one  Barbet  Masterson were  get injured  suspended  would  seriously lacking Therefore  believe  should  looking  get  least two centre backs  this summer with one   these being  more experienced player over the age   and the other being  younger defender with resell ability

 add confusion though the contracts  Bright and Manning are   the end  the season   they don extend they surely leave   free and   offer does come through  can imagine the club won sell  Worse still  that  Kakay Masterson Hämäläinen  Smyth turn out   saleable assets their contracts are also   the end  the season

Looks like   relying heavily  the existing squad especially our youngsters for  least the beginning portion  the season   far  what the club has been preaching for the last few years this does all appear   part  the plan    exciting   will hopefully see more youngsters develop similarly  Eze   can plug   few holes  may still start the season timidly but hopefully  finish strong

 stay somewhat competitive QPR has been doing  combination  the following

 scouring the country for players who have been discarded from other clubs like BOS and Eze
 taking  solid  unspectacular older players like Cameron and Wallace 
 promoting players from our own youth team like Darnell Furlong and Kakay
  recent years  have also got strikers  loan who were too expensive  buy like Nahki and Hugill but  seems   not have enough money  pay for wages  players like that

   tough team  support because they will break your heart Like earlier this season  was  convinced they were getting promoted They were   sweet spot  the table and everything was looking groovy Just when  was all ready   back  the Premiership  all went  hell

This feels familiar   because all the  teams  support are EXACTLY LIKE THIS  don know  you follow MLB NFL  NBA but  you     Mets Jets and Knicks fan  you understand  understand frustration

The club itself  really cool  their supporters  least   experience  why  root for QPR  haven been too active  this sub but whenever   post  have felt welcome and nobody has given  trouble about being American lol

  recommend subscribing  QPR  least for the audio  not that expensive and you can follow all the matches Because this club   Championship  not very easy for   see the matches  American television  QPR  the way   Until they get promoted You can watch every EPL match  Peacock

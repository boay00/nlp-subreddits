The team do not play with any passion and the fans have really had enough. We are not told the strategy or the vision for our Club. 
Who's accountable for our current mess? Not saying ‚Äúsack everyone‚Äù but need to know from the Management  ""What's Going On"".  
We will be demanding answers to the following questions
1) What is the current strategy, &amp; medium &amp; long term Vision. 
2) How effective are the senior roles 
3) Why are we failing to develop young players 
5) The directors of our team should address the concerns of our loyal fans 
It is not just down to managerial appointments, the structure of our club at every level needs to be examined.
Today we call on fans to stand at 10 minutes into the match to chant 'We want our Rangers back'
The LSA  &amp; Fan Group rep's are meeting the Club on the 1st March, &amp; if no meaningful answers received we will call a demonstration at 1400 on the 11th March (Watford) outside South Africa Road entrance for a peaceful demonstration with more details to follow.

If you're wondering why I chose QPR as my first save even though I'm a Middlesbrough fan - well a few seasons ago I went to QPR away on my birthday, I fell in love with the ground, and had an amazing weekend down there, getting the three points helped and a hell of a goal from George Friend, but I've had a little soft spot for QPR ever since, can't wait to come back to the ground one day something I think we all can't wait to do!

1. We seem to have found a goalkeeper. I have been impressed with Dieng-- his shotstopping, distribution, and command of the box all look superior to what we have had over the past couple of years. 6'4"" and just 25 years old, he could be a top keeper going forward. 
2. You cannot fault the effort of the players. Unlike some earlier versions of the team, I never dislike our players and want them to succeed.
3. Osman Kakay has been at QPR since 2005 and has patiently worked his way into the XI. Up until the end of the match he was making runs forward and covering back, making blocks. He clearly loves the club and continues to improve.
4. I am convinced we have uncovered a gem in Lyndon Dykes. His service hasn't been the best, but he challenges for balls with tenacity, has proven himself for Scotland, and shown good endeavor for QPR thus far.
5. Dom Ball is a real battler in midfield. I can see him playing a Derry role for us-- good work rate, knows his role, and a solid physical presence in the middle of the field. Now if we could just find an Ale Faurln to play alongside him...",17,233,1,2020-10-27,jjc30n
superhoops,"Don‚Äôt know why I care so much but I do. That‚Äôs my week ruined. Thought the club was moving in the right direction and signings looked decent (wasn‚Äôt convinced with Bonne). Thought we hadn‚Äôt spent the money on crap like we did when we sold Les. 

Despite the result tonight, think the back 5 with Dieng, Kakay, Dickie (although ffs tonight), and maybe hameliaen, it‚Äôs a slight improvement on last year? The problems come in midfield and upfront. 

Think our front 2 are very suspect; CMs lack creativity; Chair is not currently capable of opening the door for us. When playing this ‚Äútotal football‚Äù, passing from the back, you need a creative mind to create some chances. With no BOS we have gone from a Lower mid table side to a bottom 6 team. Losing Eze, Hugill, Wells and Manning is c¬£40m of quality players. Replaced with only one proven quality player (Adomah, 32). 

With sheff Wednesday on minus points and Wycombe in the league, we can‚Äôt go down.....can we? 

Seriously need a playmaker. 

Think we have to stick with Warburton; but if he doesn‚Äôt get a win in the next 3 or 4, what can you do!?

Now I ask this with a slightly rhetoric intent. I became a fan during the 13/14 championship season but had been following them since 11/12 around the first stint back in the Prem with the promise of a rich future ahead and some big name signings (who in turn hugely let us down). 

I just wanted to know your thoughts into where we came from and how from potentially being the first Man City are now fighting it out in the Championship Mid-Table again. I understand with the last few years more focus has been put on developing youth and turning into a selling club which is probably a much better direction but when do you all realistically think we could be back in the top tier and actually stay where we belong?

I apologise if any of this sounds ignorant, I just want to know more about the club I love and support and hear straight from the long time supporters if possible.

superhoops,"Just less than two months since the end of last season and the competitive season starts again. QPR face off against Plymouth in the League Cup next weekend.

Our final, also second, preseason fixture against Oxford ended today in a 1-0 defeat.  A team which narrowly missed promotion to the Championship last season, QPR should've been able to produce more than they did.  Positives came in fits and starts, but we find ourselves in a nervy situation moving forward.

Clearly we've just made a club-record sale as Eze goes off for a deal worth up to 20 million.  The strategy of developing your own is finally bearing fruit.  Great, we'll be able to use that to shore up a few gaps in defense... midfield... striker. Maybe not, as Warburton has made clear, ""We will be looking at free transfers, low costs, loan market etc ‚Äì along with many other clubs.""  We've only made two ""true"" signings so far but hopefully we spend at least a little to strengthen where necessary.  A center back would be nice, even if just for depth, to make up for the exit of Leistner, Hall, and Rangel.  Masterson is on a run but he is still young and will inevitably experience a dip in form.  With only two named right backs, it would be ideal if this someone could cover over there too.  In the midfield, another option in case Ball or Cameron go down might not be a bad idea either.  Lastly, up top.  Even though Dykes was scoring readily for Livingstone, we took a least a bit of a punt there.  Behind him are Oteh and Ramkilde.  From what I've seen so far of those two, maybe this is an area where we will yet again dip into the loan market.  Even if can make a few more signings though, there is little time for them to gel with the team.

At the back, based on what we've seen so far, you'd have to start with Lumley or even Dieng.  Kelly did well enough, but his passing was cringingly wayward.  The defense seems solid enough but it is depth and experience that we lack.  Most excitingly in the defense is Kakay, who has to be clear favourite to Kane by this point.  Like Masterson however, Kakay is also young.  In several instances last season, Rangel was brought in to halt lengthly losing runs.  That type of experience in defense is something we need desperately.  However, the pace of both Kakay and Manning could mean for a deadly wing-back combination.  There are a whole host of options in the midfield.  Finding the right combination here will be key for Warburton.  We look to be starting with Chair, Bright, and Amos.  However, Shodipo, Battache, Thomas, Smyth, and even Alfa could also play a part.  Of the subs today, Smyth appeared particularly dangerous, beating players and creating chances.  Up top, here is hoping the hold up play of Dykes can be of benefit to all of those players.

To add confusion though, the contracts of Bright and Manning are up at the end of the season.  If they don't extend they'll surely leave on a free and if an offer does come through, I can't imagine the club won't sell.  Worse still is that if Kakay, Masterson, H√§m√§l√§inen, or Smyth turn out to be saleable assets, their contracts are also up at the end of the season.

Looks like we'll be relying heavily on the existing squad, especially our youngsters, for at least the beginning portion of the season.  As far as what the club has been preaching for the last few years, this does all appear to be part of the plan.  It is exciting, as we will hopefully see more youngsters develop similarly to Eze. If we can plug up a few holes we may still start the season timidly, but hopefully we'll finish strong.

Thanks for the support on the two previous instalments of this squad review, if you haven‚Äôt yet seen these you can find the [first part here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/g8nhfc/squad_review_201920_part_1_goalkeepers/) and the [second part here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/ga8vwc/squad_review_201920_part_2_full_backs/).

As I stated in the last part it seems that is well known within the R‚Äôs faithful that our defence is holding us back this season, in particular we are lacking in quality at Right back and Centre back. In this part I am going to discuss the current squad depth at Centre half and some transfer targets who we can look to get in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mark Warburton‚Äôs transfer policies**

¬∑ Tends to buy a mix of young players and older experienced players

¬∑ Often purchases players who he has previously managed (players from Brentford, Rangers &amp; Nottingham Forest)

¬∑ Often purchases players from Scotland, Premier League youth teams and Lower English leagues

¬∑ Favours players with resell value

¬∑ Signs a lot of players on free transfers

&amp;#x200B;

**Current squad depth**

&amp;#x200B;

*Yoann Barbet* (26)

&gt;From his first appearance in a pre-season friendly against Austria Vienna it was apparent how **great of a passer** *Barbet* was, performing diags across the pitch with immense precision. This ability is shown in how he has **played the most accurate long passes (8.1) per game** for a centre half in the league, this is done whilst maintaining a **great 78.9% pass success** overall. There was early worries about *Barbet* diving in needlessly in the box and giving away penalties, however these soon subsidised when his defensive prowess was shown, putting out **1.1 tackles** and an **immense 2.4 interceptions per 90 minutes**. His importance to the squad became evident when he was away injured, with *Barbet* in the squad we have maintained a 50% win percentage and without we have a measly 21.1% win percentage, accentuating his prominence in the squad.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, first choice Centre Back**

&amp;#x200B;

*Connor Masterson* (21)

&gt;Another great coup from the summer, *Masterson* failed to make a first team appearance in the league until January, however he has been **impressive in most games** he‚Äôs played thus far, playing an **average of 61 passes per game** with an astounding **86.1% accuracy**. Despite this, Masterson hasn‚Äôt displayed the best defensive stats, only making **0.8 tackles** and **interceptions** per 90 minutes, regardless of these statistical shortcomings *Masterson* **hasn‚Äôt been dribbled past** in his 675 minutes of game time, this stat could be **wrongly calculated** though as it appears that he was dribbled past in the lead up to Barnsley‚Äôs goal in our first game back. It seems *Masterson* has a great future ahead of him and we should look to pin him down to a long term contract with his current one ending in **2021**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, play sporadically as back up**

&amp;#x200B;

*Toni Leistner* (29)

&gt;**Last season‚Äôs captain**, *Leistner* was one of our **only consistent performers** last term and he has impressed when he‚Äôs played this season, however *Leistner* has made it evident that he **doesn‚Äôt want to return** to play for the R‚Äôs and therefore we should look to get rid of him in the transfer window. The German Centre half was **linked with a move to Aston Villa for around ¬£5m** in the summer but now with only a year left on his contract I would be happy with a **fee around ¬£3m**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Sell**

&amp;#x200B;

*Other players:*

*Joe Gubbins* (18) has been in and around the first team training throughout the year and it appears that he **may be in line to make a first team appearance** before the end of the season.

*Themis Kefalas* (20) has been **out on loan at Billericay** in the Vanarama National league south this season, he has **played well** according to fans.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential transfers**

With the recent departure of *Grant Hall* and the imminent departure of *Toni Leistner* it would appear that we may enter the summer transfer window with only two first team Centre backs. This is of course a huge issue and if one of *Barbet* or *Masterson* were to get injured or suspended, we would be seriously lacking. Therefore, I believe we should be looking to get at least two centre backs in this summer, with one of us these being a more experienced player over the age of 25 and the other being a younger defender with resell ability.

&amp;#x200B;

I have compiled a list of players I feel we should be targeting as they follow Warburton‚Äôs transfer policies and, they would fill the current void we have in depth in this position.

superhoops,"After the past 2 performances I thought I'd breakdown how I see the current squad and plans for next season.  


GK - We all know Lumley is error prone and cost us points at the start of the season. For me the jury is still out on Kelly, he's had some good performances and was quick to come out today against Charlton, but I cant help but feel like he has a mistake in him. I would probably look for a keeper in the next window. (Not Joe Hart. He left Man City because he couldnt play football with his feet and thats exactly what Warburton will expect from him. Disaster waiting to happen and wages will be too high).  


LB - A priority. Manning has had some good performances this season but defensively he's been consistently poor. I dont think there's been a winger this season that hasnt turned him inside out at some stage of the game. He has a great left foot and puts in some great crosses on his day but defensively its a disaster. Havent seen too much of Wallace but its clear he's coming towards the end of his career and is prone to injury.  


RB - A priority. Rangel been a great servant and somehow still puts in a shift at 37 years of age. My concern is that he gets in the team ahead of 26 year old Todd Kane who signed a 3 year deal with us at the start of the season. 3 years and he has looked nothing short of hopeless every time he has played. Maybe he needs a run of games to get some momentum going but my god it doesnt look promising. I hear lots of talk about Kakay but I think part of going down the academy route is recognising that not every player that comes through will make it, and not every player is good enough. We naturally look to him as the RB that has been been through our system and had loans etc but I personally dont think he's good enough.  


CB - A priority. I like Barbet when he's alongside someone that can do the dirty work. Classy player on his day and his left foot is great but I think he needs an experienced head by his side to compliment his ball playing style. When you put Masterson next to him it just looks a bit of a shambles, although I do think Masterson has a future at the club. Hall had his injury problems but was a good CB at this level when fit. He played 30 games this season and is a big loss for these last few games.  


***When the assessment is that Barbet is the only player I would start in our back 5 next season, its no suprise that we concede so many goals and look so poor at the back. Shambles.***  


CM - A priority. I cant make my mind up on Dom Ball or Luke Amos. Both have shown glimpses of what they're capable of but equally have had some #### poor performances this season. I think they both make good squad players but if I'm being perfectly honest I just dont think they're good enough to start if we want to push for top half and the top 6. I can understand Geoff signing a new deal, he's an experienced head and clearly has quality even though its fading. Another problem area for us.  


CAM, LM, RM - I've grouped these positions together because its clear under Warburton that the 3 of them rotate and are expected to be competent in each of the 3 positions. Recruitment here is obviously dependent on what happens with Eze and Bright. Assuming that we lose them both (which is looking increasingly likely based on Les and Lee's recent interviews) then this becomes a priority area for us, but for now its definitely our strongest area. I like Chair and think he has a big future ahead of him, he has a part to play over the next few seasons and hopefully fulfills his potential.  


ST - A priority. I actually think Hugill is a good striker at this level. He'll never make it in the premier league because he clearly lacks composure and loves to miss a sitter. That being said, he finds himself in the right places and always has a goal in him with the right players behind him. West Ham will want money for him that we definitely wont (and shouldnt) pay so I think we'll be parting ways at the end of the season. Yet again this leaves us light in this position (I sound like a broken record), with Oteh as the only recognised striker at the club. Oteh for me is similar to the Kakay situation, he's clearly not good enough. 1 goal in 13 appearances at Walsall and 3 goals in 18 appearances at Bradford just doesnt cut it. I'm all for promoting youth and looking to the academy but part of that is accepting that some players arent good enough.  


So the conclusion is that I would buy a new GK, LB, RB, CB, CM and ST. The only positions I feel as though we're strong are the front 3 behind the striker, but thats including Eze and Bright who are inevitably leaving. What does this mean? Another rebuild...  


I'm ok with rebuilding as long as this time its done with more quality. We signed 13 players this season for just ¬£50,000 which on paper is fantastic business. When you assess the likes of Dom Ball, Marc Pugh, Liam Kelly, Geoff Cameron etc based on what they came in for then you can call it good business. But if we really want to push on to greater things now then the money we sell Eze and Bright for MUST be invested in the squad. I dont have faith that the club will get a lot of money for the pair of them, so hypothetically lets say we make ¬£10m from their sales. Even if only half of that is invested in the squad its significantly more than the ¬£50,000 spent this season. I dont want to hear excuses from the board next season if we lose our star players 'well it was always going to be harder after losing the likes of Eze and Bright'. The narrative we have been sold is that we make no revenue from ticket sales so our transfer business must be funded by player sales. Next season will be the first for a long time that we have made considerable money from player sales and the board should be judged accordingly. I understand FFP and I like that we are trying to be more sustainable, but there is no excuse for not investing in the squad next season. Here's hoping that we see some progress, although I have little faith.",16,1158,6,2020-06-27,hgv5dl

It seems that most QPR fans are unanimous in the belief that our defence has held us back this season, whilst being the 3rd best scoring team this season we have conceded the 3rd most goals. In particular, it appears that we are lacking quality at Centre back and Right back. In this write up I will evaluate current squad depth focussing on the full backs and pick out transfer targets that seem applicable to Warburton‚Äôs key transfer policies.

[You can find the first part of this write up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/g8nhfc/squad_review_201920_part_1_goalkeepers/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Mark Warburton‚Äôs transfer policies**

¬∑ Tends to buy a mix of young players and older experienced players

¬∑ Often purchases players who he has previously managed (players from Brentford, Rangers &amp; Nottingham Forest)

¬∑ Often purchases players from Scotland, Premier League youth teams and Lower English leagues

¬∑ Favours players with resell value

¬∑ Signs a lot of players on free transfers

&amp;#x200B;

**Right Back**

It‚Äôs become apparent throughout the season that Warburton wants our team to play similar to how his previous sides have played with a 4231/433 formation that has both full backs being able to attack and defend effectively.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current squad depth**

*Angel Rangel* (37)

&gt;Upon signing a one-year contract extension *Rangel* has continued how he left off last season, he has been a fairly competent defender performing **1.5 tackles** and **0.9 interceptions** per game, whilst putting out an **average 0.3 key passes** and dribbles per game. The veteran has shared games with new signing *Todd Kane*, who appears to be worse defensively than *Rangel*. With his contract expiring at the end of June and *Rangel* not getting younger (**turning 38** in November) it could appear that his time with the R‚Äôs could be up, however I feel that Rangel is fit enough to fill in at Right Back if need be next season and he could be a vital role model to younger players in the team.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, One year extension with role of coach offered at end**

&amp;#x200B;

*Todd Kane* (26)

&gt;Having signed on a free from Chelsea in the summer, *Kane* had high expectations to fill the void left by the departing *Darnell Furlong*, however a wide range of fans have agreed that he hasn‚Äôt been up to the mark this season, and despite playing more progressive passes than *Rangel* with **0.5 key passes per game** *Kane* only completes **0.1 dribbles per game**, the same as *Grant Hall* and less than *Connor Masterson*. Moreover, he has been poor defensively, constantly giving the ball away being **disposed 0.5 times per game**. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if Kane leaves and if we can get a decent amount of money I would take that in an instance.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Sell if possible**

&amp;#x200B;

*Osman Kakay* (22) ‚Äì Out on loan at Patrick Thissle

&gt;Having been playing in the Scottish division this season I am unable to obtain stats to assess how well *Kakay* has done, however going of his limited playing time in the first team in previous seasons he has appeared to be able to perform well in the Championship. It seems like Patrick Thisle fans have been happy with his performances going off responses on twitter.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Keep/loan out**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential transfers**

*Joshua Emmanuel* (22) ‚Äì Bolton ‚Äì Valued at around **¬£300k** with contract expiring in **June**

&gt;Would be quite a **low risk transfe**r with his age and it being a free transfer, *Emmanuel* only moved to Bolton in the summer on a free from Ipswich but has impressed this season, performing a respectful **1.6 tackles** and **1 interception** per game whilst only getting **dribbled past 0.3 times** per game, the second best for right backs in the league. *Emmanuel* doesn‚Äôt only excel defensively though, he has completed **2.4 dribbles** per game, the most for a right back in league one and also carries out a decent **0.7 key passes per game**.

&amp;#x200B;

*Callum Brittain* (22) ‚Äì MK Dons ‚Äì Valued at around **¬£250k** with contract expiring in **June**

&gt;Another low risk transfer as he is young and would be a free transfer, *Brittain* is a better passer of the ball than *Emmanuel*, providing **1 key pass per game** with an overall pass success of 77.5%, he also completes a great **1.6 dribbles** per game. However, *Brittain* isn‚Äôt as good defensively, only putting out **1 tackle** and **0.5 interceptions** per game, this may be due to him playing various positions on the pitch however.

&amp;#x200B;

*Moses Odubajo* (26) ‚Äì Sheffield Wednesday ‚Äì Valued at around **¬£1m** with contract ending in **June**

&gt;*Odubajo* has been **unlucky with injuries** throughout his career, he was arguably the best Championship right back in the league in his promotion season with Hull City and, was also one of the best upcoming youth talents in the league with Brentford in the 14/15 season under Warburton. This season he has been great defensively with **2.5 tackles** and **1.1 interceptions** per game, going forward however *Odubajo* has struggled, only producing **0.3 key passes** and only completing **0.5 dribbles per game**. *Odubajo* would be a risky transfer due to his injury history, but with his past relationship with Warburton and the fact that this would be a free transfer could make this a worthwhile deal.

&amp;#x200B;

*Perry Ng* (23) ‚Äì Crewe Alexandra ‚Äì Valued at around **¬£500k** with contract ending in **2021**

&gt;By far the best Right back in League Two this season, *Ng* has been brilliant defensively, executing **2.3 tackles (most in league)** and **1.2 interceptions** per game (3rd most in league). He has also been great going forward, providing **2 goals** and **6 assists**, aswell as providing **1.3 key passes (most in league)** and **1.9 dribbles per game (most in league)**. The fact that he has is playing in League Two may bring suspension as to whether he could make the jump up two levels to the Championship, however there have been many players that have adapted to this jump in recent years, these include Adam Webster, Matt Grimes and Ollie Watkins.

&amp;#x200B;

**My ranking of potential transfer targets:**

1. Joshua Emmanuel
2. Moses Odubajo
3. Perry Ng
4. Callum Brittain

&amp;#x200B;

**Left Back**

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Squad depth**

*Ryan Manning* (23)

&gt;The makeshift Left back at the end of last season, *Manning* has performed well at his first full season at full back this season, he has been great going forward **scoring twice** and providing **5 assists**. He has produced the **highest amount of key passes in the league** from left back with **1.9 per game**, and also has completed **0.9 dribbles** per game, a respectable amount. However, despite stats suggesting Manning has been great defensively with **2.3 tackles** and **1.4 interceptions** per game, he has been **inconsistent defensively** in parts. *Manning* has been linked with moves away from the R‚Äôs to Premier League teams, but I feel unless we can get a decent fee above the reported ¬£5m we should keep him.

**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, first choice Left Back**

&amp;#x200B;

*Lee Wallace* (32)

&gt;Due to injuries *Wallace* didn‚Äôt make his league debut at left back until **mid-December**, this had led to him falling behind Manning in the pecking order. Despite this *Wallace* has been consistent at Left back and a decent left sided Centre back in a back 3, defensively he has made **1.6 tackles**, **1.5 interceptions** and **2 clearances** per game. However, going forward *Wallace* has struggled only producing **0.6 key passes** and completing **0.2 dribbles per game**. With his contract ending next summer we shouldn‚Äôt be rushing to give the aging, injury prone player a contract extension anytime soon.

**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, back up Left Back and Centre Back**

&amp;#x200B;

*Niko H√§m√§l√§inen* (23) ‚Äì Out on loan at Kilmarnock

&gt;*H√§m√§l√§inen* has been out on loan in Scotland this season and has seemingly **performed well according to the Kilmarnock fans** on social media. He has performed well going forward providing **2 assists** but there aren‚Äôt any stats available to analyse how he‚Äôs played defensively. With his **contract expiring in June** we should move fast to extend it to ensure we don‚Äôt lose a potential talent on a free. If we manage to get him to sign a new contract we can expect *H√§m√§l√§inen* to **play sporadically** throughout the season as he could fill in for *Manning* who can also play in the midfield and *Wallace* who is injury prone and can play at Centre Back.

**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, extend contract**",1,1410,0,2020-04-29,ga8vwc
superhoops,"**Introduction**

With football around the world being brought to a halt due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and the growing uncertainties about how this season will be played out, I have decided to take it upon myself to review the current squad and analyse how we may progress on in the next season with certain transfers.

I will try to keep possible transfer targets as realistic as possible, to do this I have attempted to adhere to what I believe is Mark Warburton‚Äôs transfer policies.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mark Warburton‚Äôs transfer policies**

* Tends to buy a mix of young players and older experienced players
* Often purchases players who he has previously managed (players from Brentford, Rangers &amp; Nottingham Forest)
* Often purchases players from Scotland, Premier League youth teams and Lower English leagues
* Favours players with resell value
* Signs a lot of players on free transfers

&amp;#x200B;

**Goalkeepers**

*Liam Kelly* (24)

&gt;Seems to have been an astute signing at around **¬£50,000**, *Kelly* has had a mixed season so far, the Scottish keeper had a slow start, failing to keep a clean sheet in 6 games, however following his penalty saving heroics against Leeds Kelly has kicked on and has shown how good he can actually be, keeping **3 clean sheets in the 10 games** following the initial drought. Although what makes *Kelly* stand out from the other keepers is his ball playing ability, he has an impressive **67% pass success** whilst accurately **playing 6.4 long passes per game**, this along with an impressive **1.5 saves in the penalty box per game** (which is the joint 5th best in the league) suggests that he has a successful future with the R‚Äôs.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, first choice keeper**

&amp;#x200B;

*Seny Dieng* (25)

&gt;Having signed for us back in 2016 *Dieng* has not yet appeared for the first team, however, I feel he may finally get a chance to get some game time next season as he has impressed on his loan out at Doncaster Rovers. He has kept a very impressive **9 clean sheets in 27 appearances** in League One, this along with a great **pass success rate of 70.4%** suggests that he can fit straight into a Warburton passing style of play.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict ‚Äì Keep, back-up keeper**

&amp;#x200B;

*Joe Lumley* (25)

&gt;Having joined the club as a youth player at 16 *Lumley* has had a very mixed career so far at the club, having impressed last season, keeping an imposing **14 clean sheets** in his first full season as the main goalkeeper, this form lead to him being rumoured to be joining either Bristol City or Aston Villa, but of course these moves never came to fruition and Lumley stayed. This season has been a polar opposite of the last though, Lumley has costed us on multiple occasions, suffering a huge **6 errors leading to goals**. This along with his failure to adapt to a passing style of play leads me to believe that *Lumley* could be on his way out.

As far as the wage bill goes you can see we start off relatively modestly, then balloon into an unsustainable mess as soon as we made it to the Premier League.  At the end of the 2014/2015 season, when we were relegated, we dropped the wage bill by almost 30 million by the start of the 2015/2016 season.  We have since spent the last three years reducing the wage bill even further.  At the end of the day, we are only a few million over from where we started almost a decade ago.

Next up we have a graph that I think corroborates Ferdinand's line that the club is heading in the right direction. Basically this graph is saying: How efficient are we with our wage bill in relation to where we finished in the table.  The higher the value the better.  In 2010/2011 we were very efficient, ultimately achieving promotion on a modest 20 million.  In our Premier League days our efficiency takes a turn for the worst.  Our wage bill balloons by 4x but our place in the table is rooted squarely in the relegation zone.  Since our return to the Championship we have trended towards up in our efficiency, making headway on becoming the club we were a decade ago.

I think we've really made significant strides towards becoming a sustainable club since our messy days in the Premier League.",14,269,4,2020-03-05,fe2q6q

superhoops,"Hi all,

I'm from Italy and I was in London travelling for business this weekend.

So, I had a free Saturday and decided to go watch a QPR game.

Stopped at Queens Tavern for a couple of ales, meet some incredibly nice people, and then straight into Loftus Road stadium.

The game and and the atmosphere were AMAZING. Got a scarf, sweater and home kit from the store. These memories will last forever, it was such an amazing experience. And I mean all of it, even if I was soaked in rain, it was one of the most fun things I did in a while.

So that's it. You've got a new fan.

Thank you to all of you fans and the team for the amazing performances!!

I was thinking of buying tickets to one of the stands that the biggest fans like to inhabit (according to the internet), most likely the Ellerslie Road Stand R-block.

I just think it might be an even better experience to watch the game with people who really love the club. I‚Äôm sorry if this is a strange question, I‚Äôm just not that familiar with English football culture on any deeper level.

superhoops,"So having watched every available pre season friendly from the R's I thought I'd make a post on some patterns I personally noticed about how Mark wants us to kick the ball about, as I thought it might be useful if someone hasn't been able to watch the matches.

**Formation**

We've mostly played a 4-1-4-1, 4-3-3 or whatever you like to call it. A back four, midfield three including one mid sitting just in front of the back four, one box to box midfielder a bit further forward and one more attacking mid who still drops quite deep when needed. Two wingers and a striker obviously. 

[A example lineup](https://i.redd.it/kjjdeqxwwvc31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Attacking play**

Probably the most noticeable aspect is the very high tempo, whether it means running down the wing like a madman or passing the ball about in a quick fashion. Much emphasis on wingers to take their man on, but also on fullbacks to overlap to provide a safe secondary option for the winger. The high tempo applies also to aggressive pressing immediately after losing possession, where furthest midfield two join in as well. I'd imagine a important form of scoring goals this season will be getting on the end of crosses, whether it is by shooting or heading the ball into the net. 

**Keeping possession**

I can't be the only one who gets shivers down their spine when they hear ""playing from the back"" combined with QPR. Anyway, that's what Mark's trying to do, and it has looked okay IMO. Get used to our GK rolling the ball out quite a lot instead of trying to thump it for a opposition goal kick. The key will be whether Barbet, Hall, and Leistner (if he stays) are good enough on the ball. Barbet has seemed very confident, but Hall, having been out for so long, has understandably looked a bit off the pace here and there. Leistner is our best defender in terms of pure defending IMO, but hard to tell if he'll fit into Mark's system. 

**Defending**

Keeping possession is very closely knitted to this section. The style Mark apparently wants is that the first though will be to try to work our way out of the situation by keeping the ball on the ground and potentially starting a quick attack. Otherwise, defending is defending and there's no much more I can say about this matter.

**Potential issues**

There's no doubt that when Mark's tactics work it will look very pleasing on the eye and be effective on the pitch. But what are the main points where this style has a chance of coming short with the players we have?

1. Counter attacks. Everyone who has watched even one of the friendlies must have seen this. The flip side of having overlapping full backs is the huge space they leave behind them, which has been utilised by nearly all of our oppositions resulting in several 2v3 or 2v4 situations. The key here is to have proper knowledge of what the other 10 players have to do when a fullback goes on a run so that you can have even a partial coverage of the defensive third.
2. Situational knowledge. In other words, when to clear the ball to row Z and when to keep it on the ground for a potential counter attacking chance? Whether to pass the ball back in order to retain possession or to attempt a cross that might result in a attack your way? There have been a few occasions, just the latest one today, when we've attempted to play ourselves out of a too tricky situation, which for example resulted today in giving possession away in our own box in a very dangerous position. This will probably take some time to get properly fixed, but hoping that it doesn't lead to too many opposition goals. 
3. Reliance on crosses. What if the opposition has such a good backline that our wingers can't get into good crossing positions or our forwards just can't get into end of the crosses? Can't say we've passed our way through the middle too many times yet, but hoping that if it is needed they can do it. 

All of this being said, Pugh, Kane and Hugill are very good signings who will surely come in handy and can't wait to get ourselves a winning start at Stoke on Saturday! You R'ss!!",21,733,4,2019-07-27,cikmhz

superhoops,"**Right back:**

With the loss of Furlong it is clear that Rangel is our starting RB.  We had hoped to get Sterling on loan but that move is now reportedly off.  Rangel, at 36, is unlikely to last the season.  Loanee Matthew Smith and Dominic Ball can both play right back but it isn't even close to their natural position.  Playing either of these two at right back will leave a gap in midfield.  We need to sign someone at right back, loan or otherwise.  Could get Baptiste back on a 1-year contract.

**Midfield:**

Let's get in Judge and Cameron.  We need to sell Luongo to recoup some of the 4 million we spent on him.  Our only senior team midfielder left is Scowen.  Smith is already dealing with an injury.  Amos and Ball have looked good in preseason so far.  Regardless, we still lack depth and experience.  The addition of Judge and Cameron will round out our midfield options.

**Attacker:**

Mlaka and Oteh are the only two recognized strikers in the team.  Neither are likely going to be sufficient to lead the line week-in week-out.  Need to bring in an experienced striker.  Bony and Hooper are available on a free, or we go down the loanee route again looking for someone similar to Wells or Hemed.

&amp;#x200B;

superhoops,"I've decided to do a write up looking in to the current depth of positions and where I feel we can strengthen and who can come in to fill these gaps. In this specific write up I'm going to be looking at the position of Centre-backs.

&amp;#x200B;

# Current depth:

***Toni Leistner*** **(28)** \- Current captain at the club I feel Leistner's first season in English football was a partial success, standing at 6'3"" he was a decent threat in the air at corners, winning 4.2 aerials per game, this threat in the box was displayed in our home 0-0 draw with Reading where he hit the crossbar twice. From a defensive stand point Leistner was decent, winning 1.4 tackles and interceptions per game. However, where he excelled was in the clearance department where he made 6.7 clearances per game (5th in the league). Overall, Leistner looked a solid addition to the squad, and was proven to be our best defender in the squad.

&amp;#x200B;

***Yoann Barbet*** **(26)** \- New signing from rivals Brenford, Barbet looks to be a great coup on a free transfer due to his versatility and consistency at Centre half for Brentford over the last four years, where he made 107 appearances in the league. Barbet is up there with the best ball playing Centre-backs in the league, Barbet played 0.4 key passes per game season whereas Adam Webster played 0.5 per game. However, despite being  6'2"" he isn't as great in the air as you'd want in a Centre half, only winning 2.3 aerial duels per game.

&amp;#x200B;

***Grant Hall*** **(27)** \- Having struggled with a knee injury over the last two seasons Hall will be looking to come back into the first team this coming season. Hall seemed to be one of the best defenders at the club before his injury and he had some decent performances in the closing stages of last year including his composed performance against Watford in the 5th round of the FA cup. It will be interesting to see if Hall can return to full fitness and in turn become a key figure in the team again.

&amp;#x200B;

***Darnell Furlong*** **(23)** did feature at Centre-back last season but I still feel his best position is at Right Back.

Additionally one of our U23 players could fill in at Centre-back if need be, ***Giles Phillips*** **(22)** was on the bench when we lost 2-0 to Derby last season, whereas ***Charlie Rowan*** **(21)** and ***Ben Wells*** **(19)** have both came for respected Premier league academies in Watford and West Ham. However, I do still feel there is room for an additional Centre half and so I looked up some potential transfers.

superhoops,"**Loans exiting**: Wells, Cameron, Hemed.  

**Analysis**: Wells would be the only player worth looking at signing permanently.  With a market value of ¬£4.05m, is likely to be out of our league financially speaking.

**Players out of contract**: Bidwell, Lynch, Hall, Wszolek, Cousins, Rangel, Shodipo, Baptiste.

**Depth Chart**:

GK: Lumley, Ingram.

LB: (Bidwell), Manning.

CB: Leistner, (Hall), (Baptiste), (Lynch).

RB: Furlong, Kakay, (Rangel).

LM: Osayi-Samuel, Manning, (Shodipo).

CM: Luongo, Scowen, Goss, (Cousins).

RM: Smyth, (Wszolek).

AM: Freeman, Eze, Chair.

ST: Smith, Oteh, Smyth.

**Analysis**:

**Defense**: Left back has no cover and thus we should prioritize re-signing Bidwell.  He is reliable and rarely injured.  At centre back we also run into problems if we do not re-sign Hall and Baptiste.  Hall seems to be past his extensive knee problems and both have performed consistently well in recent years.  Not only that but Baptiste can provide cover anywhere across the back line.  Lynch should be let go.  Between his constant injury problems and lack of quality, he is simply not good enough.  It is worth considering retaining Rangel if the price is right.  He can provide good experience to Furlong but he is getting up there in age and there are questions around whether he can stay fit.  If we can keep Bidwell, Hall, and Baptiste we should still consider signing another CB/LB.

**Potential Signings (criteria being out of contract, under 30, likely improvement):** 

**LB:** Jonas Knudsen (Ipswich, Out of Contract), Martin Olsson (Swansea, Out of Contract), Joe Mattock (Rotherham, Out of Contract).

**CB:** Mike van der Hoorn (Swansea, Out of Contract), Yoann Barbet (Brentford, Out of Contract), Mark Beevers (Bolton, Out of Contract), Michael Ihiekwe (Rotherham, Out of Contract)

**Midfield**: Both wings seem in good hands, especially if we prioritize signing Wszolek with the option for another year on his contract.  We lack depth at central midfield.  Goss returns from his loan but there is little confidence he is worth a spot in the first team.  Cousins has been injury prone and also lacking in quality in his time with QPR and should be released.  We will likely need two new players to be confident in our depth at this position.  There is talk that Freeman could be sold off to a Premier League club next season and we could definitely use that transfer fee to finance the purchase of several players.  What is more is that even if Freeman was to go, we would still have plenty of depth at attacking midfield.

**Potential Signings CM:** Markus Henriksen (Hull, Out of Contract), Alan Browne (Preston, Out of Contract), Lewis Wing (Middlesbrough, Out of Contract), Lewis Macleod (Brentford, Out of Contract), 

**Striker**: If we do not sign Wells permanently, and it is very unlikely that we will, we will surely need to bring another striker into the team.  We should definitely work Oteh into the team off the bench, but as a team we still struggle to find a true striker since Austin left the team many years ago.

**Potential Signings ST (going over 30 years old here):** Fraizer Campbell (Hull, Out of Contract), David McGoldrick (Sheffield United, Out of Contract), Lee Gregory (Millwall, Out of Contract), Freddie Sears (Ipswich, Out of Contract).

superhoops,"So, as our championship status is practically confirmed for the next season I thought I'd make a round-up on some matters such as the ever present talking point of our expiring contracts and offer some of my thoughts. Brace yourself, this might be long-ish.

**Outgoings**

Before I get to our expiring contracts I'd just like to make a point on our wage structure. A small detail that amazed me was when Millwall was interested in loaning Smith but staggeringly weren't able to afford his wages. Just let that sink in. Millwall, like it or not a club in very similar situation to us, can't afford to loan in our reserve striker. That made me wonder what are we paying to other players, especially those that we signed shortly after our relegation in 15/16 and 16/17 seasons? I'm completely fine with Luongo potentially being one of our high earners since he's a top player but the thought that Joel Lynch could well be the best paid defender in our books really makes you think.

That said, the **following players are out of contract this summer**:

(Loans of Wells, Cameron and Hemed end)

**Jake Bidwell**. A decent championship left back in my opinion, aged only 26. Transferred in from Brentford, where he was a regular starter. From a wage perspective, surely there must have been a financial factor in play to abandon a regular starter position just to switch to a rival club? Obviously not sure what we're actually paying him but from all the players out of contract I feel he might be the one with finances playing a big part in renewing.

**Joel Lynch**. Such a strange defender. One moment he's dancing ""take the L"" with Toni after popping in our second goal past Ipswich, the next he's making the same schoolboy errors again and again in our end resulting in conceding goals. Hate to say this but he's 31, which should be the age in which defenders are in their prime, and Joel's prime is not really convincing if I'm being honest. Probably on a expensive contract as well as he was signed during our first season back in the champ. Wouldn't renew.

**Grant Hall** and **Jordan Cousins**. Very similar players with a horrendous injury history but both with potential to be good championship players. Jordan only 25 years old, Grant 27. Tricky to say if we should or shouldn't renew. Again will depend on wages but honestly have no idea. Both have seemed like class players if they are anything like the short glimpses they've offered us so far but really can't blame the club if they don't renew either.

**Pawel Wszolek**. Transfermarkt says that we have a option for a further year in his contract, a very average winger in attacking sense with excellent workrate defensively which is definitely his strong point. Would renew unless a good alternative appears.

**Angel Rangel**. Stay. Please. If it's not for a playing role then I think we need a good seasoned pro who's been there and done that in the Premier League. If we renew Darnell's contract I'd imagine Angel would be really helpful for him with his experience.

**Darnell Furlong**. A decent enough young right back with a wealth of championship experience for his age. Can't imagine him being paid a fortune, would renew.

**Potential transfers out:**

I'd say our most sellable player would be (obviously) Freeman. A good player no doubt but I'd say we're out of options if a PL club comes calling with a decent bid and wages combination from both players and clubs point of view. Hard to tell who's actually good in this current form we're in. Doubt Eze will go anywhere in the summer after his dip in form.

I've been reading about Joe Lumley being linked with Bristol City. In my opinion he's a excellent player who's not being really talked about, especially as there seem to be not that many young English goalkeepers around in the Championship. Wouldn't sell, I think he's played a major part in our improved clean sheet amount even if he's been exposed to highly questionable defensive work at times.

Potential loans depend highly on players we manage to bring in so I'm not going to write about those.

**Potential transfers in:**

A striker. Probably almost a certainty we bring a striker in for next season. Can't see us relying on Oteh and Smith, with the former being really inexperienced to be the number one striker and the latter being rather one dimensional even if he's a good goalscorer. As any Championship strikers seem to be valued on a basis of 1m / 1 goal scored I don't think we'll be able to bring in anyone from the championship. I'd like to see us go for strikers outside the UK, also considering that championship clubs can offer decent wages compared to many other smaller European first tier leagues.

Defenders, based highly on whose contracts we renew. This is a area I'd like a good experienced championship centerback to play with Leistner. Also maybe slightly more attacking alternatives to fullback areas as especially Bidwell isn't excactly lightning fast.

We're definitely fine on the midfield area, can't see any movement there unless someone is sold.

Wingers, maybe? When the loan players return there is Smyth, Wszolek, BOS, Freeman, Shodipo (and Wheeler?). That's a decent amount, but might need to strengthen if Luke is sold.

I understand that the Prem's parachute payments will no longer be in effect. But I don't know where we'll generate the money to continue paying the fine (as I was under the impression it must be paid off with revenue generated by the club).

superhoops,"What we need in the summer, id say is a pacey and prolific striker from a lower league (a modern day Les Ferdinand) or a young striker who‚Äôs proven himself in U-23 Premier League football ie Eddie Nketiah. Someone who is capable of scoring 20+ in the championship or League 1 if worse comes to worst. Liverpool and Spurs have a few strikers who are scoring ridiculous amounts of goals in youth football. A loan deal with the option to buy would be a brilliant piece of business.

Giles Phillips deserves a chance this season over lynch and Niko Hamalainen deserves a chance at left back. Ilias Chair should be given as much of an opportunity as Eze was last season and maybe Osayi-Samuel and Shodipo as wingers. 

Furthermore, with the impending departure of Freeman in the summer we need a midfielder capable of creating chances and scaring the opposition. As much as I‚Äôd love to see a return of Adel I doubt that would happen, so I‚Äôd say a Mason Greenwood/Angel Gomes type of top 6 club youth prospect would be a brilliant investment, even if they‚Äôre just on loan.

Under the right manager this QPR side - on paper- should be capable of at least a play off finish.

superhoops,"Im rarely an advocate of a manager losing their job - I think that people tend to overvalue the difference that a manager can make, and as such are quick to call for a change when one isn't always needed. That being said, having watched the game at home to Bolton on Saturday, I think it was about time for MacClaren to go. I had never before seen a team with as little tactical direction or want to play for the badge as on Saturday. It speaks volumes that the Bolton team beat us fairly comfortably, whilst also showing us exactly why they are relegation favourites, and this is before we consider the fact that they seemed to want it more despite not knowing when they'll next be paid! 

&amp;#x200B;

I never rated the appointment of MacClaren in the first place, I think that Holloway should have been given an extra season to help develop some of the youth players that he was working so well with before making way for a more modern, tactically astute manager. But that's neither here nor there - the fact of the matter is that we are now managerless, precariously close to relegation and with some of our key youth players low on confidence or loaned out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, the odds on favourite for the job is Tim Sherwood ([https://www.thesackrace.com/teams/queens-park-rangers](https://www.thesackrace.com/teams/queens-park-rangers)), but I don't think that the club could make a worse decision. Graduating from the Harry Redknapp school of football, his philosophy is to buy as many big name players as he can, with the hope that 11 of them might play well together, something that QPR simply cannot afford to do. Other favourites includeGareth Ainsworth, Mark Warburton and the recently sacked Darren Moore. Of these three, I'd quite like either to see either Darren Moore or Mark Warburton appointed. Ainsworth hasn't done enough tactically for me to believe he's capable of any upward motion and him coming back to QPR would realistically only tarnish his image at the club. Darren Moore was unjustly sacked by WBA, and although he's not exceeded expectations there, he will now a point to prove and it could work out quite well for us. Mark Warburton did a great job while at Brentford, and played the type of football that I would like to see at Loftus Road, not least because I believe that players like Freeman, Eze, Manning and Chair (when he returns) would play the better because of it.

superhoops,"So as you can tell from this post I have a quiet week and I noticed that we don't currently have a banner image for this sub. If it's okay for u/peetss I'd like to at least try to create one. I figured I'd ask here if you can think of any nice pictures of emotional/important moments for our club you'd like to see featured. I was thinking of something like in the linked picture, with probably 4-6 pictures like the 1967 cup win photo already included in the banner. The background is still also undecided, I'll probably try to see how it'd look if every picture was inside a vertical blue and white hoop. Also any other ideas are welcome! Feel free to link (preferrably high quality versions) of the pictures you may find!

&amp;#x200B;

Just bare in mind that the included banner is just a early edit and nothing is decided as of yet!

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:

Alternative designs added, no hoops or yes hoops? If I wanted the no hoops option would allow me to fit a couple more photos if necessary since the pictures wouldn't need to be so far apart from each other.

I'll probably do some actual work now and will probably finish by tomorrow so please suggest any photos :)

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE #2:

Added a version of just a picture of Loftus Road in the background, it's quite hard to make a entire picture look nice on the banner since the banner is so thin.

UPDATE #3:

Added a possible final version of the no hoops-option which turned out pretty well in my opinion. If there are any changes you'd like it's not hard at all to e.g. swap pictures etc. Hope you like it, and also Peetss if you try to add that banner please tell me if it doesn't fit properly!

superhoops,"Joel Lynch - Not good enough for QPR and never has been. Played his best football when he had Cameron sitting in front of him, aside from that awful. Makes a mistake every game, costs us points.  


Jake Bidwell - Overated. Consistently average is the best compliment i'll give him. Offers nothing but a good cross every now and then going forward, doesnt offer anything defensively. Not good enough.  


Midfield - Mass, Cousins and Scowen are all decent championship midfielders individually but we massively lack an experienced head in the middle of the park. Unsuprising that our best run of form this season was when we had Cameron sitting in front of the back 4. Strong, great interceptions, experienced, can pick a pass.  


Lumley and Eze - Fans expecting too much too soon. Lumley a great prospect, fantastic shot stopper but needs to work on distribution and aerial ability. Eze fantastic on the ball, has the ability to glide past players and create space but needs to work on defensive discipline - he's only 20 years old. Give these 2 a break!  


Matt Smith - Undeniably great in the air and a good asset to have in the squad. For me you just cant start him, we are a much better side when we get the ball down and play football. Its a shame as he's got goals in him, it just becomes very predictable and cant be done week in week out.  


Wells and Hemed - We have 2 proven championship strikers in our squad, play them both while we can! Admittedly Hemed has been injured, but was initially dropped to accomodate Eze. They've both got goals in them, why not play them together while we have can? I honestly dont know what the plan is for next season but its worrying times with Matt Smith looking like our only striker next season.  


Pawel - Not a wing-back, hes a right winger. He causes every team problems running down the right flank when hes sat higher up. Got a good cross on him and the odd goal. Tracks back well and helps out his full-back but hes not a wing-back. Playing him in that role massively holds him back and you can see his frustration. ",18,376,3,2019-02-19,asga44

superhoops,"So in the light of the loss to Swansea, I don't like the use of the current 4-4-2 with Eze and Freeman on the wings; this is a tricky one as we aren't having a fantastic season and some of our ""best"" players are being played out of position. I have tried to look at how a couple of our best creative outlets have been playing and how we could slot them in better.

**Ebere Eze:**    
He has looked great when played in a number 10 role when in behind a striker (Nakhi Wells or Tomer Hemed) but he's been put on the right wing a lot which has left our right back exposed in a 4-4-2. Often drifts inside with Freeman doing the same on the left which makes us look like a 4-2-2-2 and vulnerable on the counter. That said, he's a young player who has recently gotten a full run of games so he has a lot to learn.

**Nakhi Wells and Tomer Hemed**    
Really have made a difference for us, although they haven't been banging them in they have been putting other players into dangerous positions. With a little bit more luck things could have gone our way a little more recently. 

**Luke Freeman**    
He has looked OK, but definitely not at his best of late in my opinion. Often runs into dead ends and the final ball isn't always great, although his through balls with Wells' pace have been very good and they have looked dangerous playing off of one another.

**General Tactics**

I think tactically we struggle in a 4-4-2, square pegs round holes type of deal, Luongo has been having a *very* poor season in central midfield (has not had a single good game recently imo) and paired up with Geoff Cameron there is no real creativity in the centre of midfield.

I think a change in formation may do us some good, a 4-1-2-1-2 would allow Cameron (or Scowen) to drop in to the defensive line making it easier for the right and left backs to close down the wide areas. It would also put Eze in behind the 2 strikers where he thrives. The midfield 2 would be Freeman and Luongo with Freeman playing the ball to either the strikers or Eze in the hole. Wells has shown a really incredible workrate in getting back from what I have seen, so if he is dropping deep to get the ball then we still have Hemed as a long ball option and Eze to start a counter attack higher up the pitch, thus:

-------------Lumley---------------      
Rangel--Lynch--Leistner--Bidwell     
-------------Cameron--------------     
--Luongo--------------Freeman--    
----------------Eze----------------     
-------Hemed------Wells---------


The other option would be to play a 4-4-2 but with an out an out winger on the right (Pawel Wszolek or Bright Osayi-Samuel) and Eze in behind the striker up top. Either way, the experimentation couldn't really hurt as the current 4-4-2 system with both Hemed and Wells hasn't been getting goals for either of them (1 goal in 6 games between them). I feel like this addresses our lack of creativity in midfield - Eze can drop a bit deeper and look for through balls to Freeman and Wszolek, thus:

----------------Lumley---------------      
Rangel---Lynch---Leistner---Bidwell     
Wszolek--Luongo--Cameron--Freeman    
------------------Eze-------------------      
-----------------Wells---------------

We've now signed:

**Luke Freeman**, 12 assist 5 goals last season, need I say more?

**Josh Scowen**, all-round solid midfielder who was wanted by PL clubs but decided to join us

**Paul Smyth**, really exciting prospect and a full Northern Ireland international at the age of 20

**Bright Osayi-Samuel**, another exciting prospect who was part of winning promotion to L1 with Blackpool

**Toni Leistner**, statistically one of the best defenders you can find in 2. Bundesliga, wanted by Norwich, Villa and Fulham but decided to join us.

All five for a combined sum of 549k ¬£ (no official fees, used the reported approx fees from [transfermarkt.co.uk](https://transfermarkt.co.uk))

I think we should really appreciate the work being done by our scouting staff, somehow the FFP has led us to signing bargains I really struggle to think we'd have found if there was no 40 million pound fine hanging above our heads.",19,180,0,2018-07-13,8ymdsb
superhoops,"I already posted about some advice regarding the WBA away match 18.8, but now me and my friends decided to extend our stay to wednesday so that I could see our home match against Bristol City as well!

Which leads to my actual questions: As my friend who is primarily a CP fan wanted (quite suprisingly, probably wants to see some real football) to come to the Bristol City match with me, what is the best pub around LR for a pre-match pint? The Springbok aka Queens Tavern is the closest but are there any other good options? There is little room to sit at the Queens Tavern as much as I've seen which is something we'd appreciate since I'll probably drag him to the ground so early that I can get an autograph in my matchday programme. Also since we'd like to watch some PL on Sunday do you have any suggestions for good, tourist friendly pubs around London, perhaps in a nice location or something? Our hotel is located near Regents Park if that matters.

Also a bit off-topic but figured out this would probably be a good place to ask since there are probably many people with similiar interests here: As there are a few days without football in the friday-wednesday period, do you (especially londoners) have any suggestions for things to do in London for a band of four male football fans apart from watching football in a pub?

Sorry for a long post, tl;dr:

1. Good pubs near LR?
2. Things to do in London for four male football fans apart from football?

Sylla is arguably a better finisher than Matt Smith but offers little else.  He's scored 4 goals in 10 appearances (4 of those are starts) which is a good return but can't hold up play like Smith can and often goes missing for most of the game.

Smith is much better in the air but is so immobile that starting him means we are resigned to playing a direct style of play for the entirety he is on.  He has 4 goals in 11 but 9 of those are off the bench.

I guess it comes down to how you want to see rangers play.  Would you rather see Smith the starter and we play a more direct or Sylla and a more possession based system?",3,151,4,2017-10-31,79sli1

I've been a supporter of QPR now for at least 5 years and can say with certainty that regardless of our shaky last decade, I am proud to support his club. Efforts like these don't go unnoticed and it is beyond humbling to be part of a smaller club like QPR. I say 'smaller' in the midst of the Manchester, Liverpool and dare I say it Chelsea supporters, ever prominent in Melbourne.

A friend of mine asked me last night whether I still go for QPR. That is a question that needs no answer. I cannot imagine supporting any other club.

In the large scheme of things, banning a single newspaper, or reporter from the club won't make a big difference, but it shows our support for a fellow team who was lied about, had racist articles written about their players. Doesn't that ring true for us?

superhoops,"So basically I don't usually give much attention to e-mails from EFL, but recently I had a survey for international EFL-team supporters (like me) sent and just for curiosity I proceeded to take the survey. There were questions like ''If EFL were to broadcast  *insert your EFL team here* matches live online, how much would you be willing to pay to watch them?'' and some follow-up questions about the broadcasts.

Has this happened previously or are they actually planning to perhaps give the clubs permission to broadcast their matches live in the future? I just remembered that we changed our media partner for the next season to ''provide better live-streaming capabilities'', coincidence?

If this would happen I think it would be absolutely fantastic for international supporters and the popularity of the whole league abroad because at least for me basically the only reason I really would like QPR to get promoted again is that I would be able to watch them play live more often (well obviously I would like to get us promoted anyway but you get the point). I honestly wouldn't mind that much if I could watch QPR v Arsenal or QPR v Barnsley at saturday 15pm kickoff as long as it's on the telly.

There'll be a bit of formatting stuff so ignore that!

As with the previous couple of events, there wasn‚Äôt any groundbreaking news, but it was a very interesting evening with an excellent insight into the future plans for the club‚Ä¶ The evening was very heavily focused on the finance side, with a deluge of questions being fired at Lee Hoos on the subject, but there were some fascinating little snippets, particularly with regard to Gary Penrice re-joining QPR, along with a squad update and news on the Stan Bowles benefit game.

In total, the question and answer lasted almost bang on two hours. Some of the questions were bounced back a couple of times during the evening, so for the sake of clarity I‚Äôve compiled everything discussed under each header. Holloway apologised on a number of occasions for ""rattling off"" which made this a bit difficult to structure, but the below covers everything discussed.

The evening started by Paul Morrisey (PM) welcoming Lee Hoos (LH) and Ian Holloway (IH) to the room. Les Ferdinand was originally supposed to be in attendance, and whilst nobody at the club confirmed the exact reason why he wasn‚Äôt able to come, there was a lot of talk that it was due to a charity event that he needed to attend in Newcastle.

Paul Morrisey opened by asking Ollie how it felt being back at QPR.

**IH -** Going by championship sackings I might have another 5 months go go! Listen, I‚Äôm privileged and delighted to be back. On the way here, I was listening to a song ‚Äúback together again‚Äù in the car. That‚Äôs how it feels for me. There‚Äôs been lots of changes compared to when I was last here. After those six defeats in a row everyone stuck with me, let‚Äôs see where we can go from here.

I want some proper hero‚Äôs at QPR again... People who will wear that shirt in the same way that all of us would. Ferdinand is a prime example of what we‚Äôre after, loads of potential and the right attitude. QPR gave him the platform to go on and do great things. I want to do the same for some of our youngsters here too.[/i]

**LH -**We‚Äôve made good progress in the 2 years since I‚Äôve been here. The average age has decreased considerably. We‚Äôve re-balanced the squad really well and I‚Äôm pleased with where we are heading.[/i]

**TRAINING GROUND**
**Q: The judicial review found in favour of the council, so what‚Äôs the next steps?**

**LH -**We have won every legal battle that has been put in front of us. This review was in our favour, but this could still be appealed. The difference now is any appeal would only be an option on a point of law. This is very unlikely. 

As we mentioned previously, there has been an application for a public foot path going straight across the training ground, which is due to be reviewed in September.

This is something that we really want over the line. In amongst these appeals and legal processes, it seems to have been forgotten that we are putting things in place for the local community. We aren‚Äôt developing the land to build a load of property - we will be providing pitches that the local children and youngsters can go and play on. 

It‚Äôs unfortunate that so much money has been spent on legal fees. 

On the timescales, this has been going on for two years, just to get to this stage. I can‚Äôt put a definitive timeframe on it, but as long as foot path goes in our favour, then we are pretty much there. As has been the case previously, they may appeal again in September on the foot path, which would again lengthen the time until we can start work. Providing we overcome those hurdles, the first step would be to level off the site, and we have the license pretty much granted for that. So we will be able to start work as soon as it‚Äôs signed off. It‚Äôs looking good. [/i]

**NEW STADIUM**

**Q: Can‚Äôt we just develop Loftus Road?**

**LH-**This site is less than 5 acres. The sites we are looking at are already quite tight, and even then we are looking at 9/10 acres. Double what Loftus Road is. 

Aside from that, planning permission would never be granted on this site. The restricted light and other factors make is a non-starter. No matter how hard you try, we simply can‚Äôt do anything at Loftus Road. 

It‚Äôs extremely important for us to remain in the borough. A stones through from Loftus Road ideally.

**Q: What‚Äôs the latest on Old Oak Common?**

**LH-**It‚Äôs looking increasingly difficult, but it is still possible.

**Q: And what about the report on the Linford Christie site?**

**LH-**The Linford Christie site is very early doors. At the moment we have been going round and talking with people in the community and starting genuine consultation. We need to find out what people‚Äôs issues are and what they want for the area. If we got Linford Christie, the track would not go around the pitch. The facilities on the site are very poor, if it was possible to get a new ground here it would be mutually beneficial - we could give them far better facilities than they have now. 

QPR is the bedrock of the community. It‚Äôs an asset and should be viewed that way. We want the local people to be proud and want ground there.

**TEAM FOR NEXT SEASON**

**Q: What‚Äôs the plan on the playing side next season?**

**IH -**Wow. Togetherness is so, so important. We‚Äôve had so much change over the last few years, and players haven‚Äôt been given a fair crack of the whip to build themselves.

January was a great month for us, it really was. We got rid of people who didn‚Äôt want to be here. I tried to get some of them on board, but that mentality wasn‚Äôt changing so we needed to get rid. 

The young kids have great attitudes, there‚Äôs real promise for the future now. We‚Äôre always looking at who we bring here, or should I say, who we allow to come here. 
It‚Äôs not about ability, you need to be worthy as a person first. I think that‚Äôs what we got wrong over the past few years.

Your favourite player‚Ä¶ I would have fallen out with him. You HAVE to be a good person FIRST, respect the group FIRST. It‚Äôs a team game, selfishness has NO part to play in my squad. This is my house, you have to have manners. 

Some of our players over past few years didn‚Äôt deserve to wear the shirt. But they did a trick and everyone would say how amazing they are. Not for me.

It‚Äôs natural that some players you will get right, some you will get wrong. But the character of the person? You have to be right. Every time.

It‚Äôs difficult here at QPR because we all like a bit of flair don‚Äôt we? Les had flair - and heart. That‚Äôs the characters you need. 

You‚Äôve got to get that blend right. Look at Connor Washington, the best thing that I could do for him was getting someone in who can win a header. He knew it, the squad knew it. He‚Äôs not a winger; he‚Äôs not a lone-striker either. Now he has partner, he believes he can score goals. And he‚Äôs showing it. 

Listen‚Ä¶ Coming here and wearing that badge isn‚Äôt easy. If you aren‚Äôt scoring, or hitting that ground running some fans get on your back. 

‚ÄúCOME ON HOLLOWAY ‚Äì GIVE IT TO WILKINS!‚Äù

*laughter*

You need a blend; I was a midfielder with Wilkins. That‚Äôs the bit you need to get right.

We could easily have panicked in January but we didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a terrible time to buy and sell. It‚Äôs tough when players are telling you that they want to leave. It‚Äôs not professional for me to speak on certain positions for next season, right now everyone is doing what‚Äôs asked. 

But I‚Äôm pleased how things are going. I would like us to score more goals, but I can‚Äôt complain. 

Long term, our scouting network is on the march. I won‚Äôt name names, but we are making massive progress. Everyone that‚Äôs good is ahead of the game. You need eyes on everyone in Europe. We need to find your Kante‚Äôs. What did he cost?

We aren‚Äôt gonna throw it around like we used to, but that didn‚Äôt do us any good anyway, did it? 

Whether you‚Äôre a tackler, a passer, a flair player, there‚Äôs never an excuse for not trying. And you‚Äôve seen enough of those haven‚Äôt you? 

You might not like everyone that I bring in, but you won‚Äôt say aren‚Äôt trying!

**FAMILY STAND**

**Q: Can we move the family stand? What about putting them in the Paddocks? It‚Äôs ruining the atmosphere‚Ä¶**

**LH -**Move the kids along to the Paddock area? Firstly, the Paddocks are mostly season ticket holders, so I‚Äôm not sure how they would feel about this. If you want these kids to grow to love the club, sticking them out in paddocks probably isn‚Äôt the best way to go about it. People talk of atmosphere, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad. Last year against Brighton the place was rocking. Against Norwich it was superb too, for me the atmosphere is very heavily linked to what‚Äôs happening on pitch‚Ä¶

**IH-**You saying it‚Äôs my fault?!

*LAUGHTER*

**LH -**In a new stadium we could put the family stand in a better position. But at Loftus Road we are stuck with where it is.

**Q: It‚Äôs quite common for fans to be hit by the ball in the warm up, can this be addressed?**

**IH-**That is my fault, I do the shooting practice!

*MORE LAUGHTER*

**LH -**Next season that will be eliminated. We will have nets in front of where players warm up, we already have the footings in place.

**TARGETS FOR NEXT SEASON**

**Q: What‚Äôs the target for next season Ollie?**

**IH-**To be better than we were this year. Let‚Äôs target the top half of the table, if not playoffs. Everyone wants to be there, but let‚Äôs have a go. I touched on it earlier, but our scouting network needs to be better, we want better players here don‚Äôt we?

I visited Real Madrid when I was out of work - as I normally am! 

*LAUGHTER*

I was shown around by a little man called Paco. He didn‚Äôt speak a word of English. The facilities were absolutely stunning, beautiful. They had a surgical operating theatre by the training ground. It was unbelievable. A palace. 

We had lunch and watched them all train train. Through the interpreter, Paco turned and said to me‚Ä¶ all you really need is one pitch, one ball, and bloody good players!

*LAUGHTER*

**BURTON FIXTURE**

**Q: Moving forward the Burton game looked a good idea‚Ä¶ But why rest the players?**

**IH-**I hold my hands up to that one, that was my fault. Speaking to Birch quickly, he‚Äôs saying we should bring it forward. I didn‚Äôt realise it was so close to the window and had I known I would have left it as it was. We would have been stronger playing them on the Tuesday. Okay, we lost, so what? Would we lose if we played them again? I don‚Äôt think so. I was wrong in my management. I should have looked at it properly, but I take full responsibility on that one.[/i]

**ACCOUNTS**

**Q: How are things looking on the finances? We‚Äôve cut the losses from ¬£44m to ¬£11m, that‚Äôs good news, right?**

**LH -**It‚Äôs the first time for me that an ¬£11m loss has been celebrated as a success. Make no mistake; we have a very tough job ahead of us. In the future, it will be hard to sustain even this amount, and the parachute payments will be cut in half next season too. Then they totally stop shortly after that, so to keep even this level of loss is very difficult. We need to be faster and work smarter than other clubs. 

It comes back to what Ollie said, the importance of our scouting is critical. Other clubs can afford to make mistakes with transfers. We can‚Äôt. On that side, this January was probably the best transfer window I‚Äôve ever been involved with since I‚Äôve been in football.

**IH -**January was very good. We have some very big shoes to fill. We lost Charlie Austin and apart from, only Chery was getting any goals. Nobody else was scoring. It again comes back to balance and blend of experience and youth. Some of the young lads have been sensational, Manning and Furlong. Wow. This is what we all want.

United built an era on youth. I want to see the same here. Maybe I can manage young Furlong‚Äôs son one day. He hasn‚Äôt had him yet, but that‚Äôs what I want. 
*LAUGHTER*

We need to get the signings right. At Palace I paid ¬£6m for Dwight Gayle. I‚Äôll tell you, I was worried; he had only played for Peterborough. Fortunately, it worked out well. 

But I‚Äôm putting things in place that will keep you all happy for a long, long time. If you have that top, top knowledge you don‚Äôt have too much to worry about. 

I didn‚Äôt like the flashiness, that‚Äôs never been us. I‚Äôm told we need to move, but I don‚Äôt particularly want to leave Loftus Road, this place is special. Let‚Äôs make sure that we nurture the right kind of people to play for us. It‚Äôs already happening. Right now.

Some of them before weren‚Äôt here for the right reasons. The deals weren‚Äôt right. We don‚Äôt have that in us anymore, to make deals like that. 

The lower league scouting here was amazing once upon a time. I see Andy Sinton at the back there‚Ä¶ Where did we get you from? Cambridge wasn‚Äôt it?
*Shouts of ""Brentford"" from various people*

**IH -**WHAT?! 

*laughter*

**IH -**Good old Brentford. I‚Äôll tell you one thing about them though, their scouting network isn‚Äôt bad is it? We need to do the same.

**Q: Sticking with the accounts, can you give a forecast of how the next set will look?**
**LH -**I can‚Äôt give you a forecast, but I would say it will be roughly the same next year. It is harder though, as touched on with the parachute payments etc. We are showing foresight and looking ahead on all aspects at QPR.

**Q: Why is Reuben charging interest on money he has loaned to the club?**
**LH -**The loans that he puts in is open to anyone else that wants to contribute on the same basis. The interest is converted into shares in the club 

**STAN BOWLES BENEFIT MATCH**

**LH -**There‚Äôs a long and short answer here. Let me explain my job. Picture me as being employed to drive the van from one destination to another. I need to avoid hazards and make sure we are going on the right route. The passengers can look out the window and what is going on outside. I need to focus on keeping the club on the right line.

So far the GoFundMe page has raised ¬£35,000 for Stan and his family. What is the objective of this benefit match? Is it financial? Is it recognition? 

We did the day for Stan / Alzheimer‚Äôs Society which was a great success and great for him. He got his acknowledgement and recognition. 

I‚Äôm not sure that the original group really knew what they were aiming for. Personally, I don‚Äôt believe Loftus Road is the right venue for the day. At these kind of events, they notoriously don‚Äôt have anywhere near the level of support they think they‚Äôll get when the days comes. 

It‚Äôs not unfair to say that the previous committee didn‚Äôt gel together. I tried to get the right people that had experience in organising these kinds of events. We now have a superb team together doing this. 

One of the members organised a previous testimonial. There were massive tax implication to this, and one of them suggested doing it through the QPR Community Trust. This makes it VAT exempt, which automatically increased takings by 20%. 

I‚Äôm working 70 hours per week, trying to organise this kind of thing isn‚Äôt easy. We now have a structure; and I think we will have a date within the next 10/14 days.

**FFP**

**LH -**I‚Äôm hoping for this to be resolved by start of the season or just after the start of next season. I‚Äôm limited in what I can say, as they keep reminding me‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs going at real pace now, and will be resolved soon.

**TRANSFER BUDGET FOR NEXT SEASON**

**Q: What‚Äôs the transfer budget for next season?**

**LH -**No club in their right mind would disclose that kind of information! We don‚Äôt want to tell every club how much we have to spend!
*laughter*

**INJURY UPDATES**

**Q: Can you keep us more updated on player‚Äôs injuries?**

**IH -**I hear what you‚Äôre saying, but things aren‚Äôt always clear cut on injuries. Jordan Cousins was close to coming back, and then he complained of a bit of pain, and turned out he had ripped the muscle right off the bone. Jack Robinson is still struggling with some older injuries that keep niggling him. It‚Äôs very difficult to know day to day how long each will take.

LuaLua we thought was going to be out for weeks. I can tell you he will be out training with us in a couple of days time and be back way ahead of schedule. 

The other thing is that I don‚Äôt want to help the opposition prepare by saying who may or may not be available. That does us a disservice. 

I‚Äôll tell you one thing though, this team is as sharp as any that I‚Äôve managed over the past 10 years. The confidence is flowing and the belief is building all the time. It‚Äôs amazing. 

Against Norwich we had them down to 10 men, we‚Äôve scored two goals and we‚Äôre absolutely terrified. If we went any deeper we would have been in the main road!

It took time to get that mentality out. Players need results and rules, when that blend is right they all believe in what we‚Äôre doing. We‚Äôre getting there.

**[b][u]TRAVEL &amp; SUPPORT AT AWAY GAMES**

**Q: Official coaches are very expensive; can‚Äôt the club arrange train travel for supporters? It more comfortable and it‚Äôs cheaper for supporters.**

**LH -**We already lose money on coach travel. Rail companies were previously offering deals to clubs where you could offer discounted travel to supporters, but they have stopped doing it now. We aren‚Äôt trying to make money on this; just covering the costs would be great.**

[b]Q: Could we get players to acknowledge fans more when getting off the coach at away games?**

**IH -**Personally, I‚Äôll always stop and talk to anyone. But I don‚Äôt want to change the player‚Äôs pre-match routine. Each of them is different. Connor wants to get in the zone; he has his headphones on up until kick off. You wouldn‚Äôt believe how superstitious they are. We will do all we can for you, but changing things pre-match is something I‚Äôm not prepared to do. At any club events, believe me, they will chat and mix with everyone. But on a match day, players need to focus in their own individual way and I would never get in the way of that.

For me, when the game ends it‚Äôs absolutely vital to acknowledge the support. But sometimes when you lose you feel you have let everyone down. It hurts. 

Speaking personally, when we lost up at Rotherham a few weeks back, I didn‚Äôt want to go over and clap everyone. I was fuming. 

But I do want a group of people that feel like you do, for us to all be one. This group care, I know they do. They care about you. We need that message going through to everyone. When you have that you can achieve unbelievable things. 

‚ÄúThis is the best trip, I‚Äôve ever been on‚Ä¶ Do do dooo‚Äù

That‚Äôs what I want to hear the QPR fans singing. I want you to be proud. I want you to enjoy it. It won‚Äôt always go right, sometimes it will go wrong. The beauty with this league is you can lose a third of your games and still get promoted.[/i] 

**SCOUTING STRUCTURE**

**]Q: You‚Äôve both mentioned a lot about the scouting, can you give us anymore info?**

**IH -**It‚Äôs expanding. I can‚Äôt tell you who‚Äôs coming because he‚Äôs working elsewhere, but he‚Äôs definitely coming. He has loads of experience and we‚Äôve worked together for a long time. He‚Äôs never given me a bad character. He knows a lot of people, veey well connected‚Ä¶ People in France, Spain, Portugal‚Ä¶. We will know everyone, everywhere. 

The investment needs be right here. Luckily for me the board have put this in place for us. It‚Äôs better for the club that he is here, than I‚Äôm here. Long term you will be thinking, wow, look at him. 

This particular person recommended that I signed Luke Freeman for ¬£500k. He knew his contract situation and that he was under 24. We knew everything about him, he‚Äôs a fantastic addition. 

The club have been after this individual for about 3 or 4 years now. He wants to work with me again, so he‚Äôs going to come. 

I guarantee to you, if he tells me to sign someone, I wouldn‚Äôt need to see him myself. He will be the right sort. If you don‚Äôt play him he will work harder, play harder. We need saleable assets. I‚Äôve never been so confident in my life. 

Watford spend ¬£2m a year just on scouts wages. Benatia, who‚Äôs now playing at Juventus, they paid ¬£400k for him. I could have had him at Blackpool for ¬£4,000 per week but they wouldn‚Äôt pay the wages. That was nothing for a player like him. He was then sold later on for ¬£25,000,000! 

Every time I see him playing for Bayern I call Mr Oysten and say ‚ÄúYou seen who‚Äôs playing?‚Äù

*LAUGHTER*

This same individual recommended that I sign him. That same person was involved with Kante and Mahrez. He found them. We won‚Äôt be too far off the pace.

It all feels right. I know how to do it. We have had some adversity. 2007 was excellent, because we came through a lot of crap didn‚Äôt we? It was horrendous, but we got there in the end. Then unfortunately I was put on gardening leave by a very unsavoury character... I can‚Äôt name names, but *cough* Paladini *cough*

Oh, did I just say that?

*HEAVY LAUGHTER*

**OTHER QUESTIONS**

**Q: What reservations did you have about returning to QPR?**

**IH -**The only reservation I had was whether my wife would let me! I had to sit down and ask her if she would let me come. When you take over as a manager, it takes over everything, your whole life. It‚Äôs a big thing to give up. But Kim feels about QPR the same as I do. Fortunately. 

I almost had my time, but thank you, thanks to Kim, thanks to the club, it feels fantastic for me. Even in the bad moments I feel you trust me. 

We all want to get back in that top flight. But the top four keep getting all the money, keep growing, keep building. When you go up, you‚Äôre in danger of wrecking yourself by trying to stay there. It needs to be small steps, and for us to always think about the club first. We need to do it a bit at a time. 

You‚Äôve put up with enough here haven‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs not about where someone comes from; it‚Äôs about where they want to go. What might Manning be worth in the future?

**Q: Can we have the ‚Äòdennis the mennis‚Äô kit back next year?**

**LH -**We can‚Äôt have it every single year, but it will come back at some point. Interestingly, the feedback on this year‚Äôs kit was amazing. Hoops all the way round, finally! We actually sold more the previous year with the hoops not going all the way round. I still can‚Äôt get my head around that following the reaction we received to it.

**Q: There‚Äôs still confusion over LF‚Äôs role, can you confirm what he does?**

**LH -**Oh, I wish LF was here! 

He ties all of the footballing departments together. He‚Äôs the first point of contact with agents. He‚Äôs a great person to have around the club, he‚Äôs a gem of a man to have on board. And it‚Äôs all done with a smile and no arrogance. Perhaps next time we do one of these we can get Les to run through a typical day of his to explain how his role works.

**IH -**Management is evolving. It used to be that the managers did everything, from the signings of the players to writing up the contracts. The amounts of money involved are enormous now, you can‚Äôt possibly do all these things yourself. Without Les I would have struggled to come back. 

It‚Äôs impossible for me to do my job properly if I was dealing with agents and all of the signings. His role is absolutely invaluable to me. He is vital in allowing me to organise my group. The other bonus for me is that he can be ‚Äúbad cop‚Äù sometimes. If someone wants to sort contract they can go talk to Les - not me. He has huge role in what club will turn into. 

The deals here used to run out of control. Now we will go for the best option, if the deal isn‚Äôt right to for the club, then we move on to target 2,3,4. 

I also want Les on the training pitch, just half hour would benefit some of our lads no end.

**Q: With every referee against QPR, how do you feel about video assistance coming in?**

**IH -**This is a long time coming. It was the first time I‚Äôve ever lost 1-0 after scoring a legitimate goal (Blackburn). The lino said it was impossible to see the header and be absolutely sure it crossed the line, so he didn‚Äôt give it. Our analyst knew straight away, it was mad! Referees should be able to have a personality, but the way I see it they are all turning into robots. They have a tough job, but with video replays it will at least be fair.[/i]

**Q: The ‚ÄúStars of 67‚Äù Q&amp;A was a great evening. Can we do this more regularly please?**

**LH -**We will try and do more events. There is plenty going on behind the scenes. Problem is, if you have too many of these events it goes from being special to being the norm. We are very pleased with how many fans said that they enjoyed it.

**Q: Ollie, how much do you change tactics depending on who we play?**

**IH -**Yeah I change it a lot, I realised it wasn‚Äôt working when we lost 6 games in a row! We were too open, we couldn‚Äôt score, and we couldn‚Äôt defend. The lads weren‚Äôt comfortable with it, and we aren‚Äôt at a level where we can impose our game on any opposition and go and win.

At Leeds I totally changed it to nullify Wood. We shackled them and we should have won it. Before the lads couldn‚Äôt deal with changes, now we are winning they can switch it up and they‚Äôre comfortable with a few different systems. 

If teams start pressing and cutting out our passing, we can go straight to Smith and play from there. It‚Äôs a dying art, players like that. The players knew we needed it. Having him here lets the others grow. 

The foreign players are settling in now. Sylla, Yeni, Pawel‚Ä¶ They haven‚Äôt been here long, two of them barely speak any English‚Ä¶ Which is a good job because I don‚Äôt either! 

Some players have issues, if they aren‚Äôt on it I send them home to think about it and tell them to come back a different person tomorrow. Players can be spoilt, but that ain‚Äôt happening here. Not anymore. And we will benefit from it eventually. 

Look at Lukaku‚Ä¶ Yeah he‚Äôs signing a new deal. Oh no, he isn‚Äôt. Everton don‚Äôt have any ambition, I‚Äôm not signing. It‚Äôs a selfish attitude and I don‚Äôt put up with that

**Q: Could the Blue and White bar be utilised better? Having Sky game on? Have a player in there after the game?**

**LH -**It‚Äôs difficult with players, they normally want to do their own thing after the game‚Ä¶

**IH -**I can force them to go in if you want? 

*laughter*

**IH -**Let‚Äôs have a look at this, it‚Äôs a really important part of things.
**LH -**A lot of the time those available players are over in the family zone, but we can see.

**Q: What are the club doing to encourage new fans to QPR?**

**LH -**Well the family zone has been a real success. A lot of kids are coming to the club. New season tickets holders is up to 78 this year, compared to just 3 last year. That‚Äôs not returning fans or lapsed ST holders. That‚Äôs 78 NEW fans. The interest free DD scheme has been taken up, and made it more affordable for a lot of fans to come back to Loftus Road.

**Q: What‚Äôs happening with Ravel Morrison?**

**IH -**I have 4 kids and they all needed to earn their ice cream. Ravel‚Äôs ice cream is that he just wants to play. His training isn‚Äôt always what it should be, and his timing isn‚Äôt always what it should be. 

He needs to earn his team mates respect and work hard as them. That wouldn‚Äôt have been hard few months ago, let‚Äôs be honest. But when Ryan Manning is running 14 km ‚Äì 1,800 of it flat out. And then Pawel beats that‚Ä¶ Poor old Rav has a way to go hasn‚Äôt he? 

I know his game isn‚Äôt all about running, but we need to hold the ball better for him to be effective. He‚Äôs gradually getting there. I looked into his eyes and thought I could help him, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do. He still has a contract at Lazio for another 2 years. But we have a clause to take him. It‚Äôs all about him proving he wants to do what he says. I want talented people around me and I want my work ethic to rub off on him. I‚Äôm sure he will do it, lots of other people have been sure and they haven‚Äôt been right. 

At the minute I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever worked so hard. He‚Äôs training 3 times a day and he hasn‚Äôt let us down for‚Ä¶ 3 or 4 days! 

*HUGE LAUGHTER*

**IH -**Deep down it ain‚Äôt funny though. You have to earn what you get. You want respect, you have to earn it. Other managers get sacked left, right and centre. They may not have those principles - and good luck to them. But you can‚Äôt run after these players wiping their backside. But I hope more than anything that I can see him play for proper. I promised his mum I would do my best to help him. I‚Äôve only had one player before I couldn‚Äôt help and that was Clark Carlisle, and boy did I try. 

What a brilliant player Ravel could be. I love his ability. He might be in and around it on Saturday. We‚Äôll see.

**Q: Who are the most exciting youth players coming through?**

**IH -**It‚Äôs hard to say individuals. I loaned out Shodipo, I want him to learn a bit more, make a few mistakes for someone else then come back. Just like Furlong has done. He has a serious chance though. He‚Äôs great with the ball at his feet and running at people. 

Grego-Cox and Petrasso have really impressed me. Doughty has stacks of ability; I just struggle to find a position for him. Lumley has been outstanding; they‚Äôre waxing lyrical about him down at Bristol Rovers. Furlong and Manning have been amazing. Everyone behind the scenes are working so hard, it‚Äôs fantastic. There‚Äôs others I really like the look of, but they aren‚Äôt physically there yet.

**Q: Where does the club stand with on the discipline of Steven Caulker?**

**LH -**Not an employer in the world that would comment on that. It‚Äôs internal and ongoing process. No further comment.

**IH -**He seems to get in trouble when he‚Äôs not fit. I would love to be able to pick him, he‚Äôs a brilliant player. He started the season on fire.

**Q: What‚Äôs happening with the outstanding bank loan?**

**LH -**It‚Äôs being repaid monthly and finishes in August.

**Q: The interest rate seems quite high on what Reuben has paid into the club. With parachute payments reducing, why is he taking money out of the club?**

**LH -**As I said earlier, we will give you the same deal if you want?

**IH -**I think this is a trust thing. They‚Äôve had their hands burnt, let‚Äôs be honest. They‚Äôre now running QPR how they run their own businesses. I trust them. Les does. Lee does. These are nice people. They got caught up in it before and thought that‚Äôs the way football was. Reuben is a quiet man who‚Äôs determined to do well. He doesn‚Äôt go into this to ‚Äúdo‚Äù people. He‚Äôs a man of his word, and I want us to build a relationship, and for us to be proud. 

It‚Äôs not about what you spend, you can go and have a lovely meal in a caf√©, right? If you choose it well. Some are minging, but some are nice!

I know what you have here, and in time this will give you what you want. But we need trust. They‚Äôve lost millions on millions. My goal is to make them feel happy and good, who knows what comes then?

**Q: Could the club give up free tickets to local schools / the community for cup games? It would help boost attendance and atmosphere**

**LH -**The FA give you very few tickets to give away free. 45% of the revenue goes to us, 45% goes to the opposition and 10% to the FA. It‚Äôs crazy, but even if you give the ticket away, whether they show up or not we then have to pay the opposition and the league - even if you aren‚Äôt getting any money for the tickets. That‚Äôs why clubs don‚Äôt do it anymore, where in the past they included it in the ST price.

**Q: How good is Smithies?**

**IH -**WOW. I‚Äôve played with some good goalkeepers, but Smithies is phenomenal. Ingram is excellent and never complains about lack of game time. The way that they work is incredible. We‚Äôre blessed with great goalkeepers here. Lumley as I mentioned is doing very well, and we have a beast of a lad in the youth team who looks a real prospect. Smithies signed a new deal recently... I imagine there will be offers for him this summer. Gilks was outstanding for me at Blackpool, but Smithies is topping him, and he‚Äôs younger. Good job too because I‚Äôve never seen so many one on ones since I‚Äôve been here!

*laughter*

**Q: Have you worked much on the fitness? The players looked noticeably sharper against Leeds?**

**IH -**Not so much, but we have more desire now. I did some running drills here, and I was shocked. Pawel got in the team because of how well he did - the best I‚Äôve ever seen. Young Manning was the second best I‚Äôve ever seen, so in he went too. It‚Äôs quite simple really. You need to be able to run when playing counter-attacking football. 

Some people didn‚Äôt want to run, some people couldn‚Äôt run. Sandro hadn‚Äôt run for ages. You can‚Äôt play counter-attacking football with that. But now they believe. Luke Freeman blitzes what we had before. All these elements come together and you get more energetic performances as a result. We go long to Smith far too often for me, but the players know he‚Äôs there as an option.

Birmingham away was the best I‚Äôve seen from any team of mine. That was the day that the new boys came of age for us. The pressing, the desire, the quality. The free kick from Yeni, unbelievable. 

On Yeni, I found out what weight he was before he came to us. My fella who I‚Äôm bringing in on the scouting knew his ex-manager at Metz. So I knew he put on a lot of weight. He had a bereavement, he lost his father. He missed his flight, and by the time he got there his dad had passed away. How can you judge him on that?

I knew his body fat was nowhere near right. I showed him the calendar and said look at you there. Is that your twin brother? You eating his biscuits? He came my way, and he‚Äôs worked ever so hard.

*laughter*

No game in this league is easy. If you think we will just show up on Saturday and win, then don‚Äôt come. If they start moaning, shut them up. 

I lost to Vauxhall Motors, a terrible car I lost too! I never forget that. We‚Äôre on a mission to get you what you want. 

Against Huddersfield I was sat there waiting for someone to do something, then Freeman smashed that one in and we almost got back into it. I want those moments of magic more.

**LH -**Can someone tell our commercial man to cancel the Vauxhall sponsorship that we had lined up?

*laughter*

Paul Morrisey then presented a couple of fans signed ball and another with ¬£100 of Rangers cash.

Holloway went totally off-piste and said we should do more QPR cash. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all home made. Wouldn‚Äôt that be great! I want ¬£2,000 of Rangers cash please? U R‚Äôss.‚Äù

Paul Morrisey then went back to Holloway to sign off the evening.

Thanks for who you are.

superhoops,"Hello,

So I have been planning to finally travel to London from Finland to watch a actual live match(es) at Loftus Road. I was thinking of 4th of March vs Cardiff and 7th of March vs Barnsley, this is basically the only way i could see two matches (in which we have quite good chances of winning) within one reasonably long/short visit. Do you guys think it is worth staying the 3 extra nights (costs about 300-400‚Ç¨ more staying in a hotel) to see a midweek fixture? I don't really mind that extra time since there is quite a lot of stuff to do in London. I have seen different opinions of those midweek fixtures, some saying they have a good and different atmosphere and some saying the stadium is quite empty. If you think the midweek game isn't worth the extra money, is the match vs Cardiff the one I should be looking at or are there some other fixtures (vs Brighton perhaps?) I should consider?

Which are the go-to seats I should be looking at when booking the seats? My main priority would be a good view at the middle-ish areas of the stands, so that would narrow the choices to the seats at Ellerslie rd or South Africa rd. Since it will likely be another 2-3 years when I come and see a match again I don't mind possibly spending money on those platinum-graded seats at South Africa rd stand, but are they worth the money compared to the middle seats of Ellerslie rd? I have heard some horror stories about the huge pillars supporting the roof blocking the view, which are the seats to avoid these?

Is it allowed to have a small, pocket sized camera with me at the matches? I have seen quite a few vlogs filmed with those but I just wanted to make sure if any of you guys have any experience with this stuff.

And finally, if I stay that 5-night period, is the stadium tour worth considering?

For those too lazy to read:

Are QPR v Cardiff and QPR v Barnsley good games to watch, if not, which are? Is it worth spending extra 400‚Ç¨ on hotel to see a midweek fixture?

Which are the go-to seats positioned at the middle-ish area of the pitch?

Is it allowed to bring a pocket sized camera?

Opinions on the stadium tour?

superhoops,"So far we've managed to capture a winger and midfielder.  We've brought back Furlong and Doughty from loan and immediately put them into the team.  Unlikely now that we'll be pursuing a right back.  Polter is gone, leaving us with just two first-team strikers.  Another striker needs to be top priority.  I'm amazed we let Polter go without a replacement waiting in the wings.  One injury and our options get limited fast.

It's not just that though, one injury anywhere and we face a similar situation.  With Hall and Caulker both out we have no cover at CB if either Onuoha or Lynch go down.  What's worse is Lynch, in his relatively short time with us, has a history of minor injuries that have kept him out of the team. I'd expect loaning in a CB to be a priority as well.

Even our midfield is potentially fragile.  Luckily, even with Cousins out injured and Borysiuk loaned away we still have some depth.  We are really lacking experience though in Manning, Doughty and new signing Goss. An injury to Luongo would be all that is needed to throw the midfield into disarray.  You might be thinking, well Mackie can pitch in where needed.  That is true, and even though he's had a run of games for the first time in a long time, his rampant injury history cannot be overlooked.  A loan signing of a certain Morrison would be a smart move.

With the actual threat of relegation from the Championship looming, our current position seems somewhat precipitous.",10,258,1,2017-01-29,5qugd0

superhoops,"Seems sufficiently close enough to January to start talking about this.

First of all I just want to discuss our summer transfers, how they are getting on, and whether they have a long-term place in the team.

Ariel Borysuik.  Niggling injuries have largely kept him away from the first team with any sort of consistency.  A change in manager seems to have lost him some favour as well.  However, during his spells across Luongo in the midfield he showed the necessary quality to cement a place in the first-team.  Shows good positional awareness, physicality, tackling and is known for his ability to hit them from afar.  To me, Borysuik was always the next iteration of Henry and that type of player pairs well with Luongo.

Joel Lynch.  Has had his own fair share of niggling injuries and didn't do enough to supplant Onuoha or Hall as a starting CB.  Has seen time in the team due to injuries, but those often meant playing in an unnatural position.  Has shown flashes of ability and is worthy of a spot on the bench for now until an injury to Hall or Onuoha gives him the opportunity to stake his claim in the starting XI.

Jake Bidwell.  Can you believe he is only 23?  Probably the best addition of the entire window.  Was kept out with a shoulder injury but has otherwise been a lock in the first team and a pleasure to watch at LB.

Jordan Cousins.  Another one who has dealt with injury since his arrival at the club.  Was unfortunately situated on the wing for a majority of his apps but when played in the middle seems a different player entirely.  Has an abundance of energy and arguably played his best game for us in our most recent loss to Derby.  Is developing well as a player and will continue to feature in the squad.

Yeni N'Gbakoto.  Started off well in the squad but was sidelined for a considerable time due to a personal issue.  A niggling injury kept him sidelined as well.  Both issues since resolved he is making his way back into the squad and put in arguably his best performance in a Hooped jersey against Derby.  The unfortunate lack of wingers in the team, now provided by wing backs under Holloway, could diminish his usefulness in the squad.

Idrissa Sylla.  Striker is a position we are poor in and Sylla possesses the best scoring record at the club.  Deserves more of a run in the first team.  Neither Washington or Polter are in any sort of form currently.

Pawel Wszolek.  Was likely added for depth at the winger position after the loss of Hoilett and Phillips in the summer.  Given the absence of N'Gbakoto was gifted a chance with the first team.  Is part of the Polish national team and has done well in his appearances with us so far.  Has competition with N'Gbakoto who also plays on the right and a lack of wingers in the midfield further diminish his chances of breaking into the first team once again.

The last one is not an addition but rather a youth player who has come onto the scene with QPR in a big way this season.  Olamide Shodipo.  Plays on the left and has shown genuine hunger for the game.  It is nice to finally see us not having to go into the transfer market to replace a player.  Has not benefitted from Holloway's insistence of playing with a midfield three but occasionally makes an appearance off the bench.

I'm really pleased with the transfers we made in the summer and think they all still have a chance to come good.  Although our formation inhibits the wingers specifically, there may still be hope yet.  With that out of the way, let's talk about January.

Sandro and Henry need to go.  In addition to that both of their contracts end come the summer.  If we are going to get anything for them January is our last chance.  Gladwin should go out on loan.  Simply put he is not yet at the level required to be a Championship player.  In this scenario we would look to acquire another midfielder to go with Luongo, Cousins and Borysuik.  We also need to pursue a RB at a similar level of Bidwell.  This RB should also be able to cover at LB if possible.  Perch just doesn't cut it.  He can provide cover at RB but he really doesn't do enough game-in game-out for us to challenge promotion.  So, three out and two in, simple.

superhoops,"Hey guys, Mintyfresh here. 

As some of you guys may know from seeing me post around here occasionally, I am an American university student that has followed the club for the last 6-7 years now.   

I recently found out I will be coming to London for 5-6 months of study, starting in January (unfortunately I'll be in the east of the city and its about a 40 min tube ride to LR)

I had few questions about seeing the R's play, and was wondering if anyone had any thoughts

First, how easy is it to get tickets?  I think I remember seeing the Newcastle game was sold out, could I reasonably expect to get tickets for most home games without a season ticket or membership?  

Also, what games do you guys recommend going to?  Right now I like the look of Fulham on Jan 21, Huddersfield on Feb. 11 and Brighton on Apr 8 (although I will probably end up going to as many home games as possible).  I also imagine I'll sample some prem games if I can tickets.  I'll be right near the Olympic stadium so maybe I'll see a West Ham game or two (although I've heard its not that enjoyable an experience)

Other than football, do you guys have any suggestions of fun things to do both in the city and elsewhere in the country?  I'll be traveling quite a bit with other friends around Europe, but I'd love to spend a lot of time really getting to know the UK.

Phillips is still working out on the wing, creating chances as irregularly as he did when he was with us.

Austin though, has really hit form again with Southampton.  Scoring with regularity once again, both domestically and in Europe. Showing his natural goal scoring talent, really proud he's finally broken into the first team.

superhoops,"I was there. It was terrible. But I think it's worth trying to dissect the match from last night. Were we just unlucky to catch Newcastle in great form? Or were we set up badly? I think it's a bit of both, with the added caveat that we were missing our two key players - Luongo and Polter.

The statistics make horrendous viewing




Statistic | QPR | Newcastle
---|---|----
Shots | 7 | 29
Shots on target | 3 | 12
Pass success % | 76% | 80%
Aerial Duel Success % | 39% | 61%
Dribbles won | 4 | 1
Tackles | 16 | 14
Possession | 50 | 50

Some of those are even very misleading, the possession statistic doesn't do justice to what Newcastle did to us and how poor we were. A lot of our possession was between the backline, without any real aim. This is where Luongo would have been very useful, he's the engine that drives us forward, without him, Cousins and Henry just look awful. Lots of side to side passing with no aim. I also have to admit that the ball found itself at the feet of Onuoha and Caulker far too often... Our best passing defenders are both Bidwell and Hall. 

The shot disparity pretty much sums up the game for those of you who weren't actually there, we were on the back foot after the first 5 minutes and never really recovered. We were facing a shot pretty much every 3 minutes (nearly). Our whole line-up had a very defensive sound to it, with 5 defenders starting, but we were more open tonight than against any other team we have faced this season and it showed. We lined up in a 4-4-1-1, a lot of our problems started with the midfield and forward line being miles apart - leaving Shelvey - totally free to dominate us. I think the first time we fouled him was in the 83rd minute. This was borne out in the statistics, with Newcastle having committed 15 fouls to our 6. Very poor - we just didn't disrupt their flow. Our aerial % is also miles off from the usual, and that's because Newcastle ran at us time and time again. They also had a big strong presence up top with Mitrovic - not too far from what we try to do with Polter. 

We were also poor defending set pieces as well, both Hanley and Clark, two CBs, scored. 

**(Some) Analysis**

There are no good statistics to pick out here at all. But I think JFH got it very wrong with his tactics. We set up in a formation we haven't really utilised and had Washington playing in a Polter like fashion, with no success whatsoever. He was slow to react to changing the system, with Sylla only coming on when we were 4-0 down. Polter is key to the manner in which we play as he throws his body around and works like a 'first' defender. Washington just doesn't have the same presence, and cannot compete for the high balls or hold up play as well, he's much better to us out wide or running behind the defence, something that wasn't going to happen with that tall physical Newcastle back line. 

Second, the midfield seems listless and too far from the forward players, and it has for a couple of games. Luongo has been the midfielder we have been relying on to battle, win back the ball and run at the opposing team. Henry and Cousins aren't as assertive and that's really showed in the last couple of games, Blackburn was just as bad. 

I'm not saying that we would have won 3-0 with those two in the side, but I think they're the ones who play with real fire in their belly and get players involved. Chery was totally isolated and ineffective, and that's because he didn't have that forward/midfield support from Polter and Luongo, who complement Chery so well. #NoPolterNoParty

We were also unlucky to face a fully realised Newcastle team that had won 5 on the bounce before last night. Mitrovic and Perez form a partnership that is way too good for this league. Mitrovic twice beat Onuoha at RB (I keep tearing my hair out when he's played at RB) with pace to cause havoc in our box, resulting in two goals, with Shelvey burying one and Perez the other on the second chance. Perez himself tortured us all game long and Shelvey was the MOTM capped with that fantastic goal (no one in a country mile to put any pressure on him though). They seem to be clicking on all cylinders and are simply too big a club for this league. 

Worst league defeat in our history and the first time we have shipped six in the league since 1963 v Coventry (6-3)! I think there is no way but up from here, and I still have some faith in JFH as long as he learns from this. We need a huge huge reaction against Huddersfield, but that will be a tough ask with them full of confidence even after losing to Brighton. Does anyone else have any thoughts? 

Onwards and upwards I guess!

Aerial Duel Success % | 49 | 51
Dribbles won | 2 | 2

Overall, the stats suggest that the match was much closer than the Leeds game. From what I've read and heard, we were set up in a much more compact shape, happy to absorb the pressure. 

This is borne out in the number of clearances that our CB pairing made in the match, 18 in total, with Caulker (pretty much a unanimous man of the match) making 14 of those. We managed to deal with their crosses very very well and didn't seem to be too flustered. I think this is also reflected in the relatively low number of tackles that we made in the match, 6, with the majority coming in midfield, with Luongo yet again leading the team, this time with 4 completed tackles. Luongo also lead the team in passes, at 52, so he does seem to be growing in importance and works well beside a midfielder like Henry who just presses. He wasn't the most accurate player however, with that honour going to Henry, who made 51 passes at an 86.3% clip! 

Picking up on what was written up on [LFW](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/news/43530/qprs-golden-start-continues-in-cardiff--report), we also registered 11 blocks, with our guys getting in the way of shots, which is great to hear and see! 

On a slightly more worrying note, we lost possession a lot more than our opponents, losing it 28 times to their 17. I think this may be more to do with our shape and style of play away from home, where we will be set up to be difficult to beat, if not to win the game by playing really attractive football. If we keep picking up points though, I'm not going to complain! 

Our trend of being dangerous off of set pieces carried on this match, with us generating 5 attempts from set pieces. Having been relatively ineffectual over the last couple of seasons, this is also a nice positive change. 

Caulker netted our goal obviously, from a lovely delivery from Bidwell, and hopefully we will see him score at least a couple more from those situations. We also saw Polter earn us a penalty, and Chery convert. Chery and Caulker both paced the side with 3 shots each, and it's good to see Chery be involved. 

Overall, a good team performance, and an aggressive one, with our team picking up 4 cautions, but it's early days and nothing to be too unduly worried about. 

Finally, despite mentioning that we were set up in a deep formation, the heatmap shows us being all over the pitch and just outside of our [box](https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1084879/Live/England-Championship-2016-2017-Cardiff-Queens-Park-Rangers).

Onwards to Barnsley, a team we've beaten in our last 6 encounters in all league competitions!

superhoops,"Hello!

So I've had some free time today and did a statistical digging on our win over Leeds! I picked these stats from WhoScored again. 

The match stats were as follows:


Stats | QPR | Leeds
---|---|----
Shots | 15 | 8
Shots on target | 8 | 0
Pass % success | 70% | 74%
Aerial Duel success | 50% | 50%
Succesful dribbles | 4 | 8
Tackles | 17 | 14
Possession | 44% | 56%

I found it a little surprising that outside of the shots and shots on target, we seem to have been level pegging with Leeds throughout the match. Happy with the tackles as well, especially as our top tackler was Massimo Luongo with 6. 

The whole team chipped in defensively, which fits with the idea that we're working more like a unit and that JFH's tactics are paying off. Nedum led the team with 5 interceptions with Karl Henry just behind with 4. Caulker had 4 clearances to pace us , and shows a nice balance between the central defence and full backs. 

What was also interesting was that we created 7 attempts on goal from set pieces, something that I feel we've been a little poor on in the past couple of seasons. And it was even more pleasing to get that goal in the 4th minutes off of a corner. It's nice not having to deal with Matty Phillips' delivery! We also had 17 interceptions and hopefully that sort of number carries on over the season! 

What was also somewhat interesting was the difference in passes attempted, our 317-409. However, we pumped in 21 crosses to their 22, something that I feel really showed on the day, especially with Shomide who had 6 attempts and Chery who had 10. What is also very promising is that we seem to have cut reliance on the long ball, only attempting 75 over the course of the 90 minutes. 

A final note, we seemed to have preferred attacking down the left, the heat map on the WhoScored website bears this [out](https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1084872/Live/England-Championship-2016-2017-Queens-Park-Rangers-Leeds#heatmaps).

And on a final note, a light hearted Rob Green [Stat!](https://twitter.com/QPR_Stats/status/762398340189487104) 

Again, I don't know if anyone will find this useful/interesting, but I'm happy to look over these things! I find them weirdly fun! 

Hope that we carry on our early season form!  ",10,391,3,2016-08-09,4wy4ry

superhoops,"The new season will be upon on in less than a week and I thought I would do a bit of digging to see what the differences are between Alex Smithies and Matt Ingram. For the purposes of comparison I also threw in Rob Green to give some indication of the differences that do exist. 

All of the statistics that I have used are from [WhoScored.com](https://www.whoscored.com/) and their 15/16 database, which I think is a great website to use. 

To start the comparison off, I looked at the saves that the three keepers made (per game)



Name| Apps | Mins | Total Saves | 6 yard box saves| Pen. Box Saves| Out of Box saves | Rating | Clean Sheets |
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Smithies | 18(1) | 1547 | 3.5 | 0.3 | 2 | 1.2 | 6.95 | 7 (39%)
Ingram | 4 | 360 | 2 | 0 | 1.8 | 0.3 | 6.84 | 2 (50%)
Green| 24 | 2142 | 1.9 | 0| 0.9 | 1 | 6.24 | 7 (29%)

Overall, it seems pretty clear cut that the goalkeeping improved Green being dropped. He seems to have had a rough time of it during his half season in goal. Both Smithies and Ingram seem to have been better at total number of saves and being more confident in the box (going by the number of penalty box saves). They also seemed to have a much higher rating as well. In part I think they benefited from a more stable back line, but the number of clean sheets that Smithies had really works in his favour. Smithies would appear to come out on top of the pile by quite a margin, with Ingram a little behind. 

Looking at the other side of the spectrum, passing! This is where things got a lot more interesting. I used the per 90 stat for these! 



Name | Total Passes | Accurate Long | Inaccurate Long | Accurate Short | Inaccurate short
---|---|----|----|----|----
Smithies | 30.6 | 8.2 | 21 | 1.4 | 0
Ingram | 34.8 | 9.3 | 24 | 1.5 | 0
Green | 31.4 | 10.5 | 19.2 | 1.6 | 0

Surprisingly here, Green seems to have the most accurate long kicks per game! (I still do not miss his horrible short kicks). Smithies and Ingram seem to be similar enough when you take in to account the difference in the number of kicks that they take (4.2 per game) and that's something that the stats don't explain.

What the stats don't show are some of the more intangible features, such as commanding the box and collecting crosses/corners. However, I think that the reason that Smithies saves more shots, is because he is better at organising the players in front of him. 

I guess I wrote this to get peoples thoughts heading in to the new season. I think Smithis is the clear number 1 for Leeds, but Ingram is young and hungry, and I'm happy that we have options at goalkeeper, so even with a long term injury, we should be covered.

Why do the FFP and the financial restrictions not seem to apply to Newcastle ? Is it that they are just going to send millions more paying the fines ?

Who do you want to see relegated ? I mean this in both from the Premier league down into the Championship and from the Championship to League 1.

Here are my picks

Premier League:- 

Newcastle because of Mike Ashley, Steve McClaren and how poorly they are being run. Shows that it isn't just us who gets done-over by big names on big wages that don't care. (Might not be good for us next year because I'm sure they would go straight back up).

Sunderland because of the Adam Johnson (he should not have been playing - how many games did his performance produce a  win or draw for them - what would the league table have looked like last year if he wasn't playing - would they have been relegated ?) and having the Gerodie/Mackem derby in the Championship.

Villa - cause they are going down... and I think the way they are at the moment they could drop down two leagues before they get it together.

Championship:-

Fulham because it would be funny and TBH it might destroy the club in the short term.... it's not like they have a dedicated following...

MK Dons because it never sat well with me the whole Wimbledon thing.

Bolton because we could raid them for all their youth players.",4,248,2,2016-03-09,49nlbl

superhoops,"Hi everyone!

     I'm a student at a college in the states and I'm currently taking a class on the political economy of world football.  I was assigned to study QPR as my team for the semester and I was wondering if you QPR fans could help me answer some questions about the club and its history (I'm a lifelong Arsenal fan, but I don't really know too much about QPR).  I'm currently enjoying reading about the artificial turf at Loftus Road in the 80s and the teams success under Terry Venables. However, I still need some sort of ""insider"" information, if you will, about the club.

   Firstly, I was wondering that for those of you who have been lifelong fans and live in the West London area, what is the area like in terms of demographics (race, gender, ethnicity) and how has it changed in the past couple of years? 

 I was also wondering about QPR fan culture as a whole... What would you guys describe yourselves if you had to generalize yourselves (and has it changed over the years)?  I.e, Newcastle fans are working class coal miners, Aston Villa fans extremely white vs. Birmingham fans etc.

Any help you guys could give me is much appreciated and I hope y'all make it to the Premiership soon! the more London teams the better! Cheers!",9,224,6,2016-02-20,46ocvx

superhoops,"For me what was really surprising in yesterdays game was that the ex premier league players that supposedly are our 'best', were our worst performers. 

Matt Phillips - Maybe it was because we didn't want to sell him to someone else in the championship but please if someone bids anymore than 5 million again take the money and run away before they find out hes not worth it.  The one thing I will give to him is that he can cross a ball, and its the only reason he's still in the side. When you look at someone like Van La Parra in yesterdays game it really puts into perspective how lazy Matt Phillips is. He had a good run of form in the 2nd half of last season and somehow managed to see his valuation double. If I was JFH I'd sell Matty and be straight on the phone to Van La Parra's agent. Thats 2 times I've seen him this season (when he was on loan at brighton) and both times he's outshined matty phillips - the winger supposedly worth 10 million. 

Leroy Fer - Worst player on the pitch yesterday. Apart from scoring a few tap ins, he has been awful all season. When you play him in a 4-2-3-1 where the midfield plays such an important part you cant be expecting to take anything from the game. Lazy, Slow, sell him ASAP.

Karl Henry - Dont think I need to write anything. How this man gets in the team over Faurlin, Luongo, Sandro and Doughty when he was here really does confuse me. Once again another goal conceded that started from his error.

Full Backs - We need new full backs. Konchesky got embarrased yesterday. Hes 34, Slow, cant cross a ball and is going in the different direction of our club. I would like to see Yun play but god knows where he is so it would be nice to see us buy a young energetic left back. Perch does a job at right back but I still think we need someone else there. If Perch gets injured and forces chief to play RB, we are asking to concede goals.  

Some positives - Thought Polter was outstanding in the first half yesterday. He may not have the technical ability but he does not stop working and thats exactly the type of player you want in the championship. From the small time that Washington was on the pitch he did look promising, I'm looking forward to the future with this kid. Chery's miss really was a shame but I cannot help but feel sorry for him. Had a great first couple of starts and has suddenly been dropped for his dutch colleague leroy who again contributed nothing. I think he should be given a consistent run in the side before he is judged. Massimo Luongo should be playing every game. He wins balls that he has no right to win and really doesnt stop working, I can really see him having a bright future as long as he is not dropped. Finally Alex Smithies... Given the number 1 shirt and he stepped up big time. A trio of outstanding saves and a generally good performance was very pleasing. Oh.. and it was nice to see a goalkeeper kick past the half way line for once. 

With a bit more luck I do see a bright future under Jimmy. The majority seem to have accepted now that its a rebuilding process and the performances are getting better. Some may disagree but for me we cash in on Phillips and Fer, bring in some more young talent and then think about competing next year. COYR'S.",7,617,6,2016-01-24,42fi4y
superhoops,Austin came on in the 79th minute for Southampton and has just scored in the 87th,15,16,9,2016-01-23,42bjte
superhoops,"First half was bang average, second half was poor. Second best all over the pitch today. Couldn't string three passes together. How on earth Boro thinks Phillips is wort ¬£6m I will never know. What baffles me even more is how Fernandes appears to think he is worth even more. 

And Chery, you gotta score there, not matter how little match fitness you've got or how out of form you are. We were lucky to get a point, three would be a miracle, and today, you cost us a miracle, Tjaronn. Brilliant first touch by Washington, great work and great cross. Can't wait for him to get a start now.

We may have been very unfortunate to concede the way we did, but the defence is just inviting the shot. They're just watching him, allowing him all the time and space, and Henry doesn't let that fo unpunished. Someone needs to take charge. Onuoha needs to step up. You can't really rely on Onuoha - one minute he'll make a goalsaving tackle, the next, he'll cost us a goal. 

Van La Parra looked like Ronaldo out there. Hasselbaink needed to get Hoilett on him when he was charging down that left hand side with his superior pace, but each time it was either Henry or Konchesky who took chase. On another day that would have easily cost us a goal. Nearly did, had it not been for the Chief.

Sell Leroy Fer. Sell Matt Phillips. Bench Karl Henry (no way anyone would buy/take him on loan) and get Faurlin in. Get Mackie in on the wing. 1 win in 10. Relegation form.",3,272,10,2016-01-23,42b1zg

superhoops,"Already after a mere six games in charge, QPR ""supporters"" are already calling for the sacking of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. My response to that, is ""you can not be serious...""

Fair enough, he has not won any of the six games and some seriously poor football have been displayed, but what were you expecting? Six straight 4-0 wins?

Forget promotion. Forget the fucking play-offs even. This is the time needed for JFH to figure out what needs to be done, who needs to find the exit door and who needs to be signed. Everybody spoke about taking a couple seasons in the lower leagues, only to return stronger. But then, we kept Austin, Phillips, Sandro and Fer, and all of a sudden, not getting promoted would be a disaster. Ridiculous. Sell Austin in January, get a striker in (Dwight Gayle?), maybe two, and for the love of God, find a replacement for Robert Green. He's been costing us too many points through personal errors. Dan Bentley was reportedly upset when Southend United wouldn't let him join QPR in the summer, get in a bid for him ASAP.

And what the actual fuck does Massimo Luongo have to do to get a game? Karl Henry contributions are next to nothing, yet he's in the starting XI week in, week out. In the few nr of games Luongo has played, he has impressed me at least. He runs for hours on end, he fights and scraps like few others, and he is still young and very hungry for success. 

Would like to see Leroy Fer sold in the January transfer window as well. Spoke with a football commentator who is also a Norwich City supporter, and he told me when things aren't going Leroy's way, he has no motivation, and it shows. When he goes to ground, he doesn't jump up, he pulls himself up slowly, doesn't look interested. Can't blame him though. Going from playing and scoring in the Premier League and World Cup, to be playing Rotherham away. He's just not at all worth his wage, has scored one goal this season and that was a bloody tap-in.

A note on Polter; Apart from the 1 minute he set up Phillips and converted the following cross, he was rubbish last night - again. He has the techical ability of a donkey, and his passing accuracy can't be higher than 38%. Ramsey was banging on about his physique when he signed him, but tbh, he's not looking particularly physically superior to anyone. I've been way more impressed with JET, would also like to see Mackie up top again, let's not forget he scored 8 goals in his first 7 games for us when he signed in 2010. Polter may work his socks off, but frankly, that's not enough.

**Players I would like to see signed:**

**Josh Meekings (23):** Young, English centre back who's been Mr. Reliable for Iverness in the Scottish top flight. Last season he even booked himself a place in the ""Team of the Year"", and for a centre back he's got really good pace, and also, physique. He has much of the same problem as Polter; his physique and defending is very much up to scratch, but his technical abilities is nowhere to be seen. But let's be honest, who needs it more - a striker or a centre half?


**Tom Bradshaw (23):** Already a Wales international, Tom scored 17 goals from 29 league appearances last season, and so far this season he has got 9 from 20 appearances. Not nr 1 material for a Championship side pushing for promotion, but good back-up and one for the future.


**Daniel Bentley (22):** Despite his young age, Dan has already got over 100 professional appearances to his name. With an aging Robert Green and an unconvincing Alex Smithies, Dan might just be what we need.",13,645,9,2016-01-02,3z5agz

superhoops,"I wanted to give my opinion on who I think should leave the club in January and some players we should look to bring in. 

Out:

- Austin - Done a great job for the club but getting ¬£10+million would be great to be reinvested into the club. Even with Austin staying I don't see a strong enough side to push for promotion.

- Fer - Fer has been an on/off player since his arrival. Some days he is a game winner, other days he seems invisible on the pitch. Get some cash for him and allow Luongo and Doughty some time on the pitch. 

- Traore - What has even happened to him?

- Karl Henry - Maybe keep as a squad player, but I just don't see this love affair managers seem to have with him?

- Caulker - Reported interest from Palace, recall and sell him. Doesn't seem to have a future at the club.


In:

- Dwight Gayle - Palace looking to offload, with joint interest in Caulker perhaps a straight swap is something both clubs would be interested in. Would be a good pacey replacement for Austin.

- Damien McCrory - Hasselbaink knows him from Burton. Hopefully would get Konchesky out of the team as Yun seems to be forgotten about.

- Bradley Dack - Young, scoring goals and would be a great fit for our midfield. 

These are a few transfers I'd like to see in January. Who would you like to see come and go?",10,252,7,2015-12-30,3ysua8

superhoops,"With the exception of Charlie Austin and Sandro, I would like to see the back of some of our ex players this window. Leroy Fer's time is up for me, he's had a run in the side these past few weeks and for me he just hasn't cut it. I'd like to see young hungry Massimo Luongo take his place in the starting line up.

Steven Caulker. I've heard the rumours of palace interested in buying him permanently due to him being surplus to requirements at southampton after the van dijk deal. Rumours state that he would be involved in a swap deal with Dwight Gayle + they give some ¬£¬£¬£. I really do hope these rumours are true, gayle would produce a solid replacement/partner for Austin who possesses great pace, something we lack this year. 

Sandro. For me on a good day this guy is the best defensive midfielder in the league. Him and Faurlin together are easily our best midfield partnership (doesnt help that they are the 2 most injury prone players at the club). I've heard rumours of clubs coming in for him this window and I'd really like him to stay. If worst comes to worst and he does leave I'd like to see Michael Doughty back in the side.

Hoilett. This is a strange one for me. For someone thats sat on his ass enjoying his 50k a week for the past season or 2 this guy has impressed in recent weeks and looked like our biggest threat. Do we keep him based on his recent form or do we get rid of him as hes a liability? I think he's got to be kept as he is the only one that actually takes a man on in our side. 

Matt Phillips. Although he had a great run of form towards the end of last season and the beginning of this season, I think hes the most overrated player in our football club. His talent is undeniable but hes so lazy and unfit its unreal. He barely ever takes his man on and never jumps for the ball with any desire. 

I think the squad as a whole is highly overrated. Without Austin this squad is nothing but a championship side, our midfield depth isnt of the quality it needs to be, we NEED full backs and I cant express how badly we need a decent winger (adomah cries out to me). Anyway thats my thoughts, Id like to hear yours so please leave any comments below!!!

If Ramsey had put that team out today, he'd have needed private security to get him out of the stadium.

From early on, many of the players had their heads down. There was no energy or desire in their game, with the rare exception of Hoilett, Sandro and Poulter.

The board has stated, this season's aim is promotion and that is what Hasselbaink has been brought in to achieve.

Performances have repeatedly shown us, we are a mid table Championship club. If we want to be more than that, we have to build for the long-term, which is what Ramsey was brought in to do.

JFH has only had 1 week in charge, he's still trying to implement his style of football and probably doesn't even know his best 11 yet. To come up against a team like Burnley who are one of the hot favourites for promotion this year and outplay them in the first half as well as consistently staying tight at the back, I think thats a pretty solid first result. Grant and Ned had Andre Gray in their back pocket, someone thats scored 11 goals this season and the only thing we were lacking was some quality in the final third. All I ask is that instead of moaning after his first game in charge, lets give the guy a chance and try and bring some stability to the football club, something that we've been lacking for a very long time.

superhoops,"With JFH in, there's a new-found excitement amongst the Rangers fans, or so I feel at least, but also some nerves. At 43 and with no more experience than a champion season in League Two and half a season in League One, albeit a first place on the table after 20 games, he's not exactly massively experienced. Still has a lot to learn in terms of management.

But, to my point; do we really want promotion this season? I for one would rather take another season in the Championship, rather than yet another Premier League relegation after yet another abysmal season packed full of bad signings and ""unlucky"" losses. I think goal nr. 1 for now is to reach stability.

Junior Hoilett, Armand Traor√©, Samba Diakit√©, Rob Green (getting old, big wage, and has been shaky these last couple of months) and Karl Henry all have contracts expiring at the end of the season. Getting those offloaded would be a massive weight off all of our shoulders. Would also like to see Leroy Fer find his way out. Going from the World Cup and Premier League to the Championship, he just can't find any motivation. Not at all worth his wage, would rather see young talents such as Luongo and Gladwin get those chances, young hungry players fighting their nuts off.

Now I know what you're saying; not achieving promotion will certainly see the end of Austin and Phillips' QPR careers. Yes, it probably will, but I'm still adament stability should be our nr. 1 target now NO MATTER WHAT. Fernandes keeps saying he's learnt, but has he really? Had we been in the Premier League in the 13/14 season with the same wage, we would've been 8th on the ""wage-table"". Though this season and last seasons numbers haven't been released, I'm not expecting them to be massively reduced. A bit, probably.

Smithies have been dead awful in the few chances he's got, he conceded 6 goals for the U21's. Greeno nearing the end of his career, probably has a couple of years left though, just look at Jussi J√§√§skel√§inen (or whatever) and Shay Given. Would love to see Dan Bentley enter the doors at Loftus Road, massive talent and reportedly a bit upset he wasn't allowed by Southend United to join QPR in the summer.

Other than that, it looks like we've got ourselves a robust midfield pair in Faurlin and Sandro. Gotta love Faurlin, and Sandro is a proper warrior. Grant Hall started the season shaky, but man, he's really grown into his role. Looks solid and consistent. Though I like Onuoha, you just can't rely 100% at all times I feel. James Perch is rubbish, makes too many mistakes, and never really makes up for any of it with like a brilliant assist/goal or a 90th minute goalline clearance when we're 1-0 up away from home. 

Can't wait to get Mackie back. My favourite QPR player, but not far ahead of Faurlin and Hill. Hall and Luongo growing on me.

If you disagree or I've left something out, please call me out on it.

EDIT: Yeah one thing; would like to see Tom Bradshaw of Walsall replace Austin when he leaves. 22 years of age, scored 17 goals in League One last season, and has got 9 goals so far. Man's got pace and stamina, real talent, and has been called up to the Wales senior squad already, but has yet to feature in a game though.",9,580,8,2015-12-04,3vgi5r

*  Fer and Sandro.  I just don't feel like they play for the badge.  I mean, they can work but only when they feel like it.  Luongo was in decent form and should've played.  In his 13 appearances he has looked more determined than either Fer or Sandro.

* On the topic of midfielders, Doughty should be playing.  He had a great game against Huddersfield and was then promptly dropped from the starting XI.  Great clubs are made on homegrown talent, players who have been at the club since their youth and bleed hoops.  They have the heart that is required to achieve success.

superhoops,"Hi everyone,

TL;DR: Get latest QPR football news headlines at http://footyfeeds.net/news/team/qpr and let me know what you think of it.

I'm a QPR fan/computer science student and I've been working on a football news website. FootyFeeds (http://footyfeeds.net) is a football news aggregator - every half hour it checks for new news articles from a database of RSS feeds for the most popular football news sources around the web.

The aim of the site is provide a place for fans to quickly get all the latest headlines from all their favourite sources, and you have the option of 'Managing sources' allowing you to select the sources you want to see news from. The website should also work pretty well on mobile and I am working on an iOS/Android app.

You can see the latest QPR headlines at http://footyfeeds.net/news/team/qpr - I hope some of you find this useful. If you do or don't I was hoping to get some feedback on what could be improved.

In terms of QPR sources I think I have the majority of the most popular sources (West London Sport, LoftForWords, BBC, etc), however I want to get as many RSS feeds as possible - especially fan run websites. I've created a simple form to allow people to submit feeds to me (http://footyfeeds.net/add) or you can also just message me on here or leave a comment.

I've got a lot of ideas for the future, with the functionality at the moment being quite basic - managing sources and commenting on articles are the few currently implemented features. I'm interested in adding some sort of upvote/downvote system and possibly using social media references to determine which articles are more popular. If you have time to have a look and have any ideas it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time!
- Alex O'Callaghan

Why did it take Fernandes 6 weeks to tell Ferdinand of his revised expectation of promotion? 

[It has been 6 weeks since the window closed] 

Why did Fernandes speak to Ferdinand and not Ruben or the new CEO?

[Surely he has spoken to those two between now and the window] 

Why is Fernandes not in regular contact with the new CEO and why doesn't he know what the club's objective is? 

[He must figure in this management debacle somewhere, so where does he feature exactly] 

Given the above, who is approving all these back room hires if Fernandes isn't happy with the progress of the club? 

[At the last count we have taken on three additional salaries since the window closed] 

Why are we employing these people, like the new CEO, if they have nothing to do with the objectives of the club?

superhoops,"I want to make the following personal statement, for the record...

I'm as frustrated as the next supporter by Ramsey's amateurish substitutions, stubborn refusal to introduce competition for places in the 1st 11, occasional mind-boggling team selections and his inevitable default to fielding players at the end of their careers before youth, which goes against what we were promised. Above all, the current lack of team cohesion and the low self-confidence mean we are under-performing.

But I don't want Ramsey out, yet.

I could go back a season,  two seasons, three and copy and paste our valid criticisms; replace the names with contemporary players and management and my points would be just as relevant.

Changing managers makes no difference at QPR. We've done that and, as one recent article pointed out, QPR don't get the new manager bounce.

Under Ramsey we've seen 1 or 2 good games. QPR now play open and occasionally flowing football. A big change from the get-it-up-to-bobby, root one football we saw under Harry, or the LSD trip under Hughes.

QPR are a work in progress. The deal is that QPR is being rebuilt; manager and all.

We will not be relegated this season.

If we somehow did get promoted, I expect we'd be relegation fodder, again.

After spending more than half a ¬£billion in 4 years, the problems at QPR stem from Fernandes, who has created a club culture that tolerates failure. And what do we have to show for it, new infrastructure? We're ¬£200m in debt, with by far the highest running costs and wage bill in the league, in the mid-table of the Championship, worse off than when he arrived and we can't get rid of him. The club is sick. If Fernandes were a man of his word he'd have left a season or two ago.

The team and the manager will improve. We will finish about 8th in the table. Austin and 1 or 2 others will leave in the summer.

We got our hopes up a bit after Fer, Austin and Philips stayed on. But the club has not changed,  yet.

I'd like us to break the habit of 20 years and pursue a long-term plan, which means dropping our very high expectations and watching some dire football for a while.

Am I crazy in thinking we've only got one senior right-back at the club at the moment ? I know we've got about 4 or 5 left-backs at the club. Why are we not loaning out a few of them ?

I think Perch is okay but what about an injury (he is 30 now) or if his form dips. I know Furlong is young but I don't rate Perch as that much better than him (and I think Harriman would be fine as a 1st team backup.)

I know you can use a Left-back as a right-back if you have too (or even a Centre-back) but that shouldn't be plan B.

superhoops,"We've had a great start to the season, no question. With a bit of the rub of the green we're flying high in the league, and we've kept our best players in the transfer window. There's a feeling of quiet excitement around the club.

The really exciting part, however, isn't that we boast one of the best squads in the division. Nor should it be the promise of success just around the corner. If we're to learn our lesson from the recent past, success is as much about unity, leadership, teamwork, communication and a clear tactical style as it is about talented individuals. After all, our Premier League squad last year was technically good enough to survive. 

The exciting part is that we now finally have the platform on which to build something that the club has been lacking for the past few years. We've had to drop down a league to do it, but now we can construct something consistent, lasting and strong. It's been a soft landing into the Championship and it looks like we're on our way to balancing the books. We've got a core of players who can together be worth more than the sum of their individual values. The foundations are set.

The questions that will determine whether we're a mid-table side or a promotion chasing side will be ones like, can Ned step up and be the Chief? Will our individually talented midfielders blend into a unit that dominates teams? When we're on a bad run of form and we've got a tricky mid-week mid-winter fixture in some godforsaken corner of Northern England, will we bind closer together or split apart? Since Derry (both the on-field leader and the glue of the midfield) left we've struggled in each of these departments. 

The omens are good. But we should also remind ourselves that the kind of unity and team spirit that we need to rekindle at QPR does not emerge overnight. This is a transition period in which we change the whole ethos of the club, from chasing riches and splashing cash to growing success. We must be prepared for it to take time, and show our patience and continued support even if we don't rocket back up to the big time. No more fixing problems with expensive imports. No more turning on each other. This is our team now. Chris Ramsey is our manager. Solidity first; success second.",9,404,14,2015-09-02,3jcchy

Apparently we used to be able to get streams because the games were being shown in Malaysia (the stream was then replicated most weekends and available). While there is the off chance that during the season the opposition may have games up online, like QPR, most clubs bought into lengthy deals with Perform Group for the substandard 'player' platform many years ago. So we shouldn't expect any changes until that contract expires, which according to the club is next year. Even so, that in itself may not bring about season long live coverage, but I certainly hope so. I live in hope. In a hotter country at least.

superhoops,"I think this game is worthy of a post-match thread given its exposure on Sky, as well as it being an interesting game overall.


Lets start with the line-up:

Greeno:

Did well when rushing forward to put pressure on Cardiff, although clearly handling the ball outside his box. However, i have to consider the fact that we are likely to lose possession whenever there is a pass back or a goal kick. Bit ridiculous given his experience. Honestly thinking that we will be alright if we cash him in for the likes of Bentley or Smithies.

Konchesky:

Slow. Did his job and dove into tackles. He did make Noone look faster than Usain Bolt, but nonetheless he had composure and did his job.

Onuoha:

Had a great game in my opinion. He provided the only pace in a really slow backline. His last ditch tackle later in the game prevented us from losing and he utilised his strength when one on one just before the half.

Hill:

MOTM if we were to have won, and frankly he probably is. He was the man responsible for conceding the first goal, but he did score and assist using his fine left arm. I noticed that he was the only player on the pitch that i could hear on TV out of both teams. True leader.

Perch:

Did well in some areas, and got ripped in some instances for pace. It does seem that we have been exploited down our right side from the last two games. He or Phillips may be to blame.

Gladwin:

Great potential and gives 100%. Quite nimble for his stature and is an arial threat that we need.

Luongo:

My Australian bias is in full force. He is great. He runs and runs, whilst providing supply and opening the game up. Both he and Gladwin were great signings.

Henry:

I would rather see Faurlin next week instead. He just lacks a bit of life and vibrancy, although that isn't necessarily needed when you sit just in front of the back four. Faurlin should be able to open the game up from deep without slinging those long balls to Polter/Austin.

Phillips:

Was in glimpses the player that is worth 10m. He really needs to sort out his confidence in taking on the half-backs. Can create the cross that will win us games.

Chery:

How the hell did he keep the ball when it was lobbed to him just before or after half time. He whipped in three or four crosses right into the danger zone. Hopefully with time we will see Polter sitting there to pick them off. Decent game although he is lacking match fitness.

Austin:

Lacked fitness and obviously isn't a lone striker. Did well to get some shots off and could have ended up with a brace.

Polter:

Doesn't have great dribbling at all. He is a work horse though, getting intercepts and setting up other player onto goal. Time will help him, but i am quite optimistic.

Doughty:

Did well. Quite composed given his lack of playing time. Good player to have on the bench at the moment. His time will come when he breaks into the starting 11.

JET:

Seems like another confidence player. Doesn't mind a shot on goal, and he has flair when need be. Another decent substitute to have.

Cardiff have some decent players. Noone, Whittingham, Jones and a couple others are threatening. I think Jones was pivotal in the second half. A really good replacement for Zamora if we were to have kept the same tactics.

Overall, a fair result. We were extremely lucky and somewhat unfortunate. A much needed improvement from last week. We need a CB, a Keeper and frankly, another striker ASAP. ",9,625,7,2015-08-16,3h6ekv

superhoops,"This is a post on a [moaning thread on LFW](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/forum/150519/ramsey-satisfied-after-newport-game/#25). I think it deserves to be posted here. The guy in question's credentials are pretty good, ranking up there with most others who cover QPR (has coached QPR ladies, works for SI (Football Manager) and is one of the Loft for Words mob who follow the club all over and can be found in the Crown and Sceptre on matchdays).

&gt;I'm reasonably satisfied by what I've seen so far and there's plenty to be encouraged about. 

&gt;Here's why. 

&gt;It's the small details that matter, not the overall performances or results. Yes there will be some problems that need addressing ‚Äì but that's normal. 

&gt;You have to first look at the football you see before you consider the performance and results, or the personnel, and then you have to get an idea about the personnel and how they will come together to form a core nucleus of players that make up the starting squad. 

&gt;I've watched a couple of matches on a stream and have been to see us play against Dundee United and Newport County. 

&gt;I'm only interested in the small details, so I'll focus on those, because these are the things that give you the clues on what's going on behind the scenes. 

&gt;Let's take Tjarron Chery as an example. He took a free-kick in the first-half against Newport, a poor one, that struck the wall and then we were suddenly being hit on the counter attack. 

&gt;The free-kick was to the right of the penalty box, but the resulting play materialised quickly down our left side, with Darnell Furlong and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas nowhere to be seen on our right as they were lagging behind having been so far forward for the free-kick. 

&gt;Chery sprinted quietly back into position and filled in for them. He took responsibility for team shape and waited until the danger averted and cover arrived before heading back into position. 

&gt;How often could you say that last season when it came to the likes of Junior Hoilett or Leroy Fer, for example? Even some of our central midfield players wouldn't have done that for the team. 

&gt;That's just one of many small examples I've seen from things we've worked on. 

&gt;Against Newport, the deepest lying central midfielder often dropped back on top of his centre-back when the opposition had the ball, creating a sandwich between them and the opposing striker and freeing up the other central defender to sweep in behind if necessary or pick up someone else who might be lurking. That is something I haven't seen Rangers do for years. 

&gt;I've seen much better build up play from the back and more intelligent passing into corridors of space, that they've clearly worked on. Against Dundee United, I saw Nedum Onouha make far better passes than I've actually really ever seen him play. He wasn't on the ball, nervously waving his hands around ""jazz hands"" style like he can do, he simply knew what runs were going to be made and where to slot his pass. 

&gt;Across the last two matches, I've seen balls sprayed into wide areas, intelligent switches and passages of play designed to encourage the full-backs to attack and overlap and provide additional support to attacks. 

&gt;We've got into great positions out wide and have clearly worked on trying to put balls into the box with players supporting quickly from behind or the other flank to get into the penalty area. Sure, the quality of delivery isn't quite there yet, but the potential most certainly is. 

&gt;But more importantly. Whenever the play has broken down, we've worked hard to get back into shape and pick up in the event of being hit on the counter. The legs and pace of the team have allowed us to be a lot more dynamic in our response to defence and attack. 

&gt;Yes we have weaknesses. And the set up has provided a much clearer separation at this point between roles and who is supposed to do what in defence and attack, therefore, there are occasions where we're asking particular units to deal with particular scenarios. Some of that we've done well with and some of that we haven't, however, we've also not played our strongest side in these games, so you have to balance both the good and bad elements in your mind with what it looks like and will be like when the best team is available. 

&gt;I like that we've looked fast and incisive on the counter attack ourselves, with several occasions where we moved up the pitch quickly after winning the ball. 

&gt;We've also worked on some passages of play that allow the reverse through ball to be played to runners from deep, as we saw with Matt Phillips' goal against Dundee, as well as numerous nearly there opportunities across both games, and again, the pace and legs of the side allow us to play this way now ‚Äì it's not something we could have done with just Bobby Zamora or Charlie Austin leading the line. 

&gt;We've worked on picking up the ball from deep and playing it around comfortably at the back, but to open our lines of attack and not just willy nilly kicking the ball up field, which is a huge bonus if they can maintain that going forward, especially if they don't dally around there too long. 

&gt;The triangle in midfield was nicely set up and positioned across both games. It wasn't two sitting deep with one in front, it was more of a rotated triangle, with one deep to protect the defence, one further forward to the right and one even further forward to apply pressure on opposing players on the ball. The balance of this triangle makes for good pressing in zones, but also really good options to pass and move the ball quickly. 

&gt;So there are lots of positives. 

&gt;Yes we could have looked a little sharper in front of goal in these games, yes we do need some additional players, particularly in defensive areas, but with what they're trying to do ‚Äì there's things there that will hopefully fall into place either way. 

&gt;There are always going to be concerns and unknowns, particularly with a new team. I wasn't impressed, for example, with how Emmanuel-Thomas berated the kids all the time when they didn't do something he wanted from them, or to the level he wanted. It lacked a bit of sensitive encouragement, but that might have just been one game, it doesn't make it terrible and the kids do need to learn. 

&gt;The second half the match petered out, but we had a lot of youngsters on the pitch and some of their play was youthful. 

&gt;Across the two matches so far, I'd say Massimo Luongo is crucial to the way we want to maintain possession and attack ‚Äì we tried him in two different roles across both games ‚Äì which again is sensible to see how that works and when he went off, Alejandro Faurlin didn't quite have the same style or range of passing so wasn't as effective.",4,1188,5,2015-07-27,3erl8p

Then you look at Austin, he's easily good enough to continue in the Premier League and a number of clubs are obviously interested in him, yet he has consistently stated that he's a QPR player and will only leave if he's told too, if not he's fine with playing in the Championship next season despite the damage it might do to his England hopes and that fact that another year in the Championship would make him 27 when going back into the prem.

The Mariners Trust launched Operation Promotion on 1 June with the aim of boosting Paul Hurst‚Äôs (Our manager) transfer kitty for next season. The plan was to raise ¬£20,000 in eight weeks with all proceeds raised added into Hurst‚Äôs existing budget for the Mariners‚Äô 2015/16 Conference assault. The intention was for this money to be used to fund a new, key player for next season.

The Mariners Trust will donate ¬£5,000 to the fund. What's more, Grimsby Town-supporting Euromillions winners Lee and Susan Mullen generously pledged to match the fans‚Äô total with their own donation to a maximum of ¬£20,000.

Within just a few hours of the launch, we'd managed to meet our ¬£20,000 target. By the end of day 1, we'd raised ¬£25,000 - and that didn't include the extra cash promised by the Trust or the Mullen family.

By the end of day 3 we'd hit ¬£34,000. And by the end of the first week we homed in on ¬£40,000. After two and a half weeks we'd nailed ¬£50,000.

Our efforts attracted some fantastic media coverage. We've made the Grimsby Telegraph, Cleethorpes Chronicle, BBC Radio Humberside, BBC Look North, BBC.co.uk and the Non League Paper. We were even featured on Talksport Radio and Colin Murray was so impressed he featured our plight in The Metro.

The current total on the crowdfunder can be seen [here.](http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/gtfc) At the time of posting we're standing at ¬£60k (And that still doesn't include the extra money from the trust + Lee).

superhoops,"I know it's early days, but I'm eager to put this season behind us and start thinking for the future. 

I think even without the fine, we are going to struggle in the bottom half of the table if we keep moving in this direction, we are going to lose the players who have been able to bail us out. With the fine or any transfer embargoes, I see us in a relegation fight. I've said this before but I don't think Ramsey is the right man for the job and I certainly can't see TF successfully repealing the fine given his track record of negotiation and promises he hasn't followed through with.

But the last time we went down we were inexplicably favourites to go back up, so perhaps we might fare a bit better than that. 

I don't think Liverpool will sell Sterling, so unfortunately we will miss out on the 20% of his fee, however I can see us fetching 25M in transfer fees in the summer. 

I'm encouraged by the new shift of focus on youth, but I don't think the right people are in place to implement it - from top to bottom. 

I can see us really struggling next year, and predict we won't finish any higher than 10th, with a real possibility of a relegation scrap if we're not careful.  ",5,227,4,2015-05-25,376wki

superhoops,"Yesterday the board issued a statement, committing to the club for the short-, medium- and long-term. 

I've been considering our situation. The following summarises my thoughts...

**Positives**

* Likely revenue from selling players this summer: ¬£25-30m.
* Parachute payments: ~¬£60m over 4  years.
* We are about to lose several high salary players, eg: Barton, SWP.
* Les Ferdinand is a football person and so we likely have a more appropriate plan from now on.
* If we are to have a new focus on youth, Ramsey is ideal if he remains 1st team coach.

**Negatives**

* We are about to lose most of our first eleven.
* The perception of QPR, inside football, has been seriously damaged over the past 8 years.
* Loftus road generates low gate revenues.
* We likely still have some high-salary players (eg: Onuoha, Hoilett, Caulker, Taarabt, Traor√© and Sandro).
* The club does not have a developed scouting network.
* Many of our best youth players left the club, due to a lack of first team opportunities and mismanagement of the youth academy. 
* The club is over ¬£200m in debt.
* We may face a &gt;¬£57m fine from the FA.
* We may face a transfer embargo from the FA.

**Our main challenges**

* Acquiring players for salaries &gt;¬£15k per week.
* Enticing players away from other offers, to take a risk at QPR, despite our reputation.
* Competing in the Championship against clubs that are executing well-developed long-term plans.
* Staying in the Championship - It is not too pessimistic to anticipate League 1 football in the 2016/17 season.

It is wise to prepare ourselves, as fans, for a few seasons of rebuilding at QPR. We are almost starting with a blank slate; albeit with an extreme level of debt. We will need the board's ongoing commitment while hoping their business interests continue to do well.

Fantastic to see Hill scoring. Seeing him point to the badge like that made my evening. Love the guy. So glad he's finally got his first EPL goal, but it should really be his second.

Unless Sandro was injured I thought bringing Doughty on for him was one of those youthful substitutions that was typical of Ramsey. Sandro was doing fine. I can't comment with certainty on the point as I know Sandro has only been able to play up to an hour lately but Hoilett would have been an ideal sub to bring on. 

I'm worried about our prospects because we've blown it far too many times as far as I'm concerned. Swansea, Everton, Hull, Hull again... The list goes on. I'm not sure where these performances have been but this could be too little too late. Is 4 points enough from our last 2 games? I'm not sure.

We all know how vital a win is tomorrow, and despite some crushing injuries it's definitely a winnable game. 

With Vargas and Yun out, we'll need two different players on the left and with Hill probably in the squad I'd hope we stick someone capable of defending with him. As I've said before the players can't be afraid to shoot, just look at Bobby's and Vargas's goals against West Brom and you'll see why these risks are important.

But, and this is where it gets devious.  Do we have a chance?  Is there any hope left to cling to?

Let us peer into history.

In 2002/2003, relegation threatened Bolton Wanderers took 15 points out of their remaining 8 fixtures and finished 17th with 44 points, 2 points above safety.

In 2005/2006, Portsmouth was in a similar position to us, sitting at 24 points in 17th place.  In their last 8 fixtures they managed to scrape together 14 points, finishing in 17th place with 38.

In 2006/2007, West Ham made a miraculous recovery in their last 8 fixtures.  Tumbling to 18th in the table on a meager 23 points, West Ham won 6 of their last 8 fixtures coming out with 18 points and finished safely in 15th position.

In 2011/2012, Wigan made a similarly astounding recovery.  Winning 6 of their last 8, ascending from 18th to a comfortable 15th by the end of the season.

So, in the last 15 years there have been four occurrences of teams that have saved themselves from relegation with just 8 fixtures remaining.

So you are saying there is a chance.

Additionally, the team has been too reliant on him this season, we need to rebuild and create a team capable of scoring goals without passing to a certain player and hoping for the best, Charlie's scored nearly half our goals which is far too much especially when we're playing two strikers. Finally, he won't go cheap and we'll make a decent profit on him which will help us rebuild the team, something I'm hoping whoever the new manager is will be keen to do.

superhoops,"I occasionally have some access to information from inside the QPR camp. This info' is from a conversation after the Palace game:

**Confidence**

Player confidence is at an extreme low - at least one first 11 player questions whether they are up to the standard required of the PL. ""We keep getting overrun"" is a phrase that's used.

**Factions remain in the camp**

There are a group of approximately 6 players who do not train with the bulk of the team (do not adhere to the main training regime). This group includes 2 of the usual suspects and some of our most experienced stalwarts, who feel they know better- The likes of SWP and Taarabt are laws unto themselves.

**Training/Coaching methods**

This was highlighted as the most important factor in our under performance. We have inherited Harry's training approach, which has changed little in style since the 1990's.
If you look at the likes of Mourhino and other elite team managers and their coaching staff, they make notes during  games - they are writing down player names and the minute of the game that player makes a mistake. They then use that information to coach the mistake out of the player. Allegedly modern techniques like this are not used at QPR and haven't been, at least since Harry started with us. 

We have the same coaching staff as under Harry, senior players are having trouble respecting the training techniques being used. The brief honeymoon period under Ramsey is long over.

**The ¬£60m write-off**

It's not expected the FA will allow that money to be written off, meaning we are likely to see lengthy legal proceedings between QPR and the FA, should we go down this season.

**Conclusion**

Perhaps none of this tells us anything we didn't already know. What did make an impression on me is the very low self-confidence of the team, their apparent acceptance that we are relegated and the overriding dissatisfaction with the way things are being done at QPR - it is not felt we are a viable Premier League club.

NB: It should be noted that this was feedback on Saturday evening, after we'd been thumped by Palace.

-----------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I'm sorry it sounds so gloomy. It's worth remembering that the above issues are not really new to the club and were likely affected by Saturday's defeat in the telling.

All of our loanees will return leaving us with a core of players who took us up in the Championship.

Phillips-------Henry---------Barton---Traore/Hoilett

---Grego-Cox/Petrasso---Some Player from Eredivise ;)

Subs: Faurlin, Doughty, Robinson, Kpekwa, Ehmer

I'm not too sure that Zamora will still be with us due to retirement age. I think Dunne still has another 5 seasons with him, especially at Championship level. 

I would like to see Caulker and Fer loaned out, but i don't think that should be necessary unless we miraculously go straight back up. In terms of the subs, i don't know enough about our youth to be too decisive. I think we should try to offload Hoilett, just because i find him a bit of a waste of space. Honestly i think this would be a pretty decent starting 11, especially if the 6'8"" player we pick up from the Eredevisie is decent. 

Should be another interesting year for r/superhoops.

superhoops,"This guy is a poster on LFW who (apparently) works for SI and is beloved by some there for his analysis. [I think this post is worthy of being repeated]( http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/forum/140923/rio--woeful-performance-today./#7) here:

&gt;Part of the problem is that playing a high intensity and pressing game, especially against technically superior teams, is always hard work. It's difficult for sides who are in tip-top physical shape to maintain that for the entire 90 minutes, let alone a side like ours, which doesn't have the best fitness record or work ethic. 

&gt;It's that work ethic and desire to work hard that's the obvious problem. It has improved, but it's still not been enough yet. There were plenty of occasions, even when we were doing well, where I was yelling from the stands about the lack of speed they took to get back into shape for any turnover of possession. This affects everything and Spurs and Arsenal, Spurs particularly, had great depth and shape to their play. If you're not in the right position at all times, then you're going to make life difficult for yourself and in the moment you switch off, you're punished. 

&gt;The defence and attack are simply not always resetting their positions quickly enough, which means they're further apart from the next nearest unit, and which means if play breaks down or requires support, they're not in the right place to help sustain attacks or deal with impending danger. 

&gt;Take Spurs' second goal, for example, where we had Mauricio Isla play a silly ball down the line that he didn't need to make, and wasted possession. Charlie Austin chased after it, and was irritated by the ball, but then Austin decided to chase after it anyway when it was gone already and came well out of position. He looked dejected and annoyed, slowed down, then moaned (rightly so) at Isla for making such an impatient pass. Spurs took the ball, played it back inside where Austin should have been, but now he was out of play, and he signalled to Bobby Zamora and complained to Zamora that he wasn't filling in when he should and suddenly they were out of the game, Spurs had plenty of time on the ball... 

&gt;The rest of the units behind paused, not sure whether to sit and hold or press without those two in the picture and before you knew it, Ryan Mason was wondering around unopposed and picked out an easy ball over the top because the defence were now not in the right place either. And it's a goal and game over. 

&gt;Little details make a big difference. You can't afford to switch off for a moment and you've got to be prepared to work hard for every single minute of every single game. If they do that, they'll improve and see results improve. If they don't, then it's a much of a muchness and be reliant on people taking their chances when they come.",4,493,1,2015-03-08,2ybqc2

It seems pretty clear. Ow that Harry has absolutely no tricks left in the bag. Over the course of this month we haven't been close to bringing in someone who could solve our problems, and the team has been anything but an advertisement for someone to join the side. We've looked really uninspired in matches where we should do better, and can never seem capable of playing to the level we gave when we come up against some of the top sides.

I'm convinced Harry can't keep us up this season. We're better off with an interim manager who could inspire any kind of unity or excitement in this side, and bringing in someone real in the summer. This just isn't going to cut it though, and the longer we wait the more we are resigned to next season in the Championship.",10,146,10,2015-01-31,2ubg65

superhoops,"This is an important window for us.  The last chance to add quality to a team that is eye to eye with a real fight to stay in the Prem.  I think we have some areas that should be improved in these last few days.  

Back Four.  Thankfully, all but the LB position is taken care of.  It is by no means without its problem but it is competent.  Caulker has done really well for us since coming in at CB, probably the signing who we've gotten the most out of this year.  Dunne has also stepped up his game to Premier League level, something we weren't sure he'd be able to achieve at this stage in his career.  Onuoha, while not getting the first team run he had probably hoped for, has proved adequate and on occasions even creative. Isla, on a loan, has really developed into a decent RB which is lucky for us considering his usual position is up higher on the wing.  When it comes to LB, it looked as if Yun was the answer.  He put in a string of good performances but gradually tailed off until his recent injury.  Hill has come in and done a job but he is being played out of position and it shows.  Traore is not a Premier League LB.  Maybe he could do better up the wing but he is not a defensive player.  Yun looks to be ready to make a return but if we need anything on defense I think it is a proper LB.

Midfield.  I'd say we are worse off in midfield than defense honestly.  Fer has shown to be a competent midfielder and has in all fairness done well on the left wing.  Problem is, he is not a winger, and needs to be played more centrally.  Hoilett, the obvious choice on the left wing, lost his chance after several games of inaccurate crosses and less than impressive decision making.  He does have pace and the ability to score but he is a player who must be played to his strengths.  Henry has proven to be our most consistent midfielder this year, which came as even more of a surprise than Dunne's resurgence.   While not particularly creative every midfield needs a player who can deliver a good performance every time.  Barton, after a promising season last year in the Championship, has faded this year and in my opinion is under performing.  Sandro, Mutch and Kranjcar are all wild cards in the matter.  Sandro and Kranjcar have both shown quality this year but it has largely been hit and miss, and also marred with injury.  If these two, especially Sandro can see the season out injury-free it would at least give us more options centrally.  Mutch, who enjoyed a career best season at Cardiff last year, has been unable to achieve the same quality for us.  His form must improve before he will get a run in the first team.  On the right we have Vargas, another loan option who has done well for us considering he, like Fer, is playing out of position.  In a similar vein we will not get the best out of him unless we play him at striker or attacking midfield.  Phillips, in similar style to Hoilett, who we thought would be the natural selection for right midfielder also showed an inability to play at the standard required for Premier League level football.  We have to wonder about Hoilett and Phillips, can they make a comeback?  I think we need a proper winger in midfield, on the right.  If we picked up a right winger Vargas could move back to his natural position giving us more options up front.  Lastly on the midfield list is Taarabt.  Honestly I just want to see him leave.  He is a drama causing eyesore on a club whose only focus should be avoiding relegation.

Charlie Austin.  I could also say our strikers but the two are basically synonymous up to this point.  Without Charlie we'd be wrecked.  Bashed and battered on the rocks.  He's been a godsend for QPR and his goal scoring record alone has done nothing less than keep us in the thick of this relegation race.  Zamora has assisted with whatever he's been able to but his age is definitely showing on the pitch and he cannot last the entire 90 mins.  I'm real proud of Zamora, he's shown heart, but his time is winding down.  Zarate, our only loan signing this window, comes from West Ham having fallen out with manager Sam Allardyce.  Going through some match reports on the fixtures he did play in for West Ham, Zarate is known for changing a game and looking a threat.  While his fitness is questioned, he could pan out to be a good gamble.  I wouldn't be surprised if he started against Stoke.  Just based on the fact we've already acquired one striker on loan I don't think we will get another in.

The recent game against Millwall featured Mutch, Hoilett, Phillips and Zarate.  Redknapp is surely trying to get them playtime in hopes their form can improve and they can launch themselves into the first team but as of yet, they have all fizzled.  Time will tell if they can improve, but in these last few days of this last transfer window, we could do well for two more players on loan and I think that is all.",6,909,5,2015-01-27,2tsyvt

We could have easily got 4 points vs Liverpool and City and have come so close to getting points on innumerable other occasions.

We've got Sandro coming back, Taarabt might want to prove something, and Yun and Zarate will be starting soon. Let's try and get behind the team a little bit instead of calling for Harry's head as soon as we drop points, yeah? There's only 2 or 3 points between us and 15th if I remember correctly. 

If Heaton doesn't pull off that wondersave to stop Vargas scoring yesterday we could have won that game. Instead we lost due to silly mistakes. These things happen, you go through good patches and bad patches. 

If we lose the next few games and end up at the bottom of the table then we can start worrying but for fuck's sake let's try and keep the faith and support the team and not stop watching games until we start winning again. ",10,238,17,2015-01-11,2s3aq0
superhoops,"I'm at the end of my tether with this club. I'm sick of staying up until 2am to watch poor defending, inaccurate passes and half hearted efforts. So here are so thoughts that I have. 

In the post match press conference Redknapp claims that we don't have he quality on the pitch to compete at this level, this is utter bullshit. We have the third highest goal scorer in the league and I would argue that any player in our starting lineup against Burnley could be in the starting lineup of Crystal Palace who beat Tottenham whilst we were getting shafted at Turf Moor.

After the game Dunne got in the verbal stoush with the away R fans. The only thing that this shows me is that Redknapp has lost the respect of Dunne who is considered a leader of the club and should be leading by example. It shows such poor discipline that I struggle to think of any player that would show such a clear level of disrespect towards his fans, his manager and his club. It epitomises exactly what is wrong with this club.

Burnley away was our chance to get the season back on track by getting a much needed away win. But instead none of the players looked like they cared at all. Unfortunately, if we can't beat Burnley away then we can't beat anyone away.

I'm not writing this to say that I have given up on QPR because the sad truth is that I will always be the sucker that loves this club and is left disappointed. I am writing this to say that I am going on strike from this club. Until QPR get an away point, a single away point, I am not going to be back on this subreddit, I'm not going to look at QPR news, I'm not going to look at the QPR or any QPR players twitter. I will look at the QPR score after every game has finished in order to see if my strike can come to an end and that is it.

Let me make this perfectly clear, I'm not doing this because I think it will change anything or that it will help or do anything at all. I'm doing this for me and that is all.",6,384,11,2015-01-11,2s0wre

superhoops,"Hoilett - Hughes signing status is finally catching up to him. Useless on the gallop today.

Traor√© - looks out of sorts. Still think he should be ahead of Hoilett in the pecking order for the left wing, couple of tricky moves on the attack today, some of which worked, some didn't. I think he knows how to play as a leftback, it's just that he can't do it - same way that I know a few guitar chords, and how hey are put into sequence to make Runaway Train by Soul Asylum, but couldn't earn an apple core busking it out.

Onuoha - not sure if he's just very rusty, or not as good as we all want him to be. He's always had a rocky time under Redknapp. Didn't think there was much improvement when he swapped into Caulkers CB position either.

Ferdindand - as per usual, it was a nail-biter whenever he found himself one-on-one in a footrace.

Mutch, Phillips - thought they started quite brightly, running around nicely, nothing too technical but enthusiastic enough, getting into positions, harassing the ball carriers and there was a very nice early intercepted pass by young Jordon, which I thought he might storm forwards at their goal. Thought it fizzled out pretty quickly though, and as soon as we went down...pah. I don't think Mutch has any creativity to add to our midfield, and pairing him with Henry looks just as flat as most other matchdays.

Austin - all over the pitch today doing work, not sure that's best for the league form but hey, that's the measure of the guy. He looked very frustrated on a number of occasions.

Fer - sweet jesus when he made that final passback all I could see was his dumb face really leaning into that Merry Christmas lipsync video the club put out. Said passback was very ill-advised, and ended in a cruel, cruel goal against McCarthy, with Campbell-Rice dancing on the ball before slotting it home. Edit: [Here is said event.](https://vine.co/v/OdHTTI1VXtl)

Zamora - not today.

Vargas -  had some nice diagonal runs cutting inside, although ultimately futile...a bit like Townsend back in 2013, who similarly lacked supporting cast.

Sheffield United had loads of little guys, lots of pace and were ravenous. A lot less of the hoofball as well. Fully deserved the win.

A lot of away support will sing ""That's why you're going down"" this season. Today was the first time it actually made me wonder if they had it right. These weren't fringe players and they weren't kids. Beyond Austin's goal instincts, I don't think we have any individual magic that will change games outside of the tactics. Without the right tactics, I don't think we'll ever be more than the sum of our parts.",7,465,4,2015-01-04,2rbjqw

**Top players**: Austin, Dunne, Green, Henry.

**Honourable mentions**: Isla, Fer, Onuoha &amp; Caulker.

We are in 15th place purely on home form, (which I think is brilliant for reasons I will list below). Away form is terrible but (Tottenham, Man Utd, Southampton, West Ham, Chelsea, Newcastle, Swansea, Everton &amp; Arsenal) is a crazy run in and I would have only expected to pick up maybe 1 or 2 points from that run in (at most) and was not surprised when we didn't pick up anything.

We survived crunch-time Christmas and came out looking good. 3 massive home games; 2 wins and a draw (and frankly that West Brom game was a Christmas gift from Austin).

We have a reverse fixture list in the second half of the season. I.e Easier games away and Harder at home but if we can keep up our home form (like we did vs Liverpool and Man City) I can see us nicking a win or two and a few draws at home from here.

Are there 3 teams worse than us at the moment: Leicester, Burnley, Hull, Crystal Palace, West Brom &amp; Sunderland are all in the mix. We just need to be better than 3 of those six.

superhoops,"As the title says, I'm a Hoops supporter from the United States. I've played association football for as long as I can remember, and have relatively recently started to get into Premier League (in the past two seasons or so). Being American, most of the games televised hear are Chelsea and Arsenal, so most of my following of QPR has come in the form of checking scores online through BBC and ESPNFC. The match at Goodison was televised in the US, so that leads me to a few questions/observations:

1. The two first goals were both indirectly caused by Joey Barton, with his pass being intercepted at midfield and his foul. Is he usually that reckless? 
2. Who do you feel is the best players on the team?
3. What's everyone's opinion on Yun Suk-Young? I've mostly gotten positive feelings with how he plays defender.
4. What's everyone's opinion on Harry Redknapp? I liked the formation he went with yesterday, but there seemed to be a lack of vision in the attacking third.

In the end, it's a couple of incredibly fortunate goals that break us down, and however the ball finds it's way into the net it breaks up our game plan. We weren't set up to concede the first goal, we wanted to take them on the counter, the game gets stretched and that doesn't suit us at all. The manner of the goals they scored is the worst thing: all deflections, and the third reminding us that no matter how good a shot-stopper Green is, he's still prone to those mistakes. 

It's an aggravating defeat, but I wasn't expecting much more before the KO. Let's remember every team we've played away will almost certainly be finishing in the top 10. Harry knows what he's doing, have faith, let's just move onto the next one. ",11,169,4,2014-12-16,2pgo3f

Crystal game - 1st Row Z1 block. Simply because all other Ellerslie side blocks had been sold out. It also notified me that we may be exposed to the elements as the seating had no cover. Doesn't really concern me, my Australian heritage shall ward off any elemental damage.

superhoops,"We all know how important our run in around Christmas is but what about those around us.

***Hull***

After their cup heroics, I was surprised to see them enter the relegation zone but I have looked up their performances only 2 wins this season (which is quite bad for this time in the season). It's unfortunate that sports media seems to have a narrative they like to see and it's why IMO Hull haven't even been mentioned as relegation contenders by outlets like MOTD.

Hull have got a difficult run in; Chelsea **A** (lose IMO), Swansea **H** (lose IMO), Sunderland **A**  (either way) &amp; Leicester **H** (either way). They could come into January with not much more points than they have now.

My prediction: **3 points** from the next 4 games.

***Sunderland***

In a decent position they have West Ham **H**  (lose IMO), Newcastle  **A**  (Lose as it is a Debry and Newcastle are at home), then Hull (either way)**H**  and Villa (either way) **A**. I would think with Gus they should be okay. They have 2 relegation six-pointers of their own but if I was a betting man I would go for Sunderland. 

My prediction: **3 points** from the next 4 games.

***Crystal Palace***

Looking to me like the strongest out of the bunch. Stoke **H** (either way) Man City **A** (lost) Southampton **H** (lose IMO) QPR **A** (QPR win IMO). Hard games all, but they surprised everyone last year. Warnock has been doing okay so far but apart from the Liverpool game nothing special.

My Prediction: **4 points** from the next 4 games.

***West Bromwich Albion***

Another Team I'm surprised to see around us. Villa **H** (either way) QPR **A** (hopefully QPR) Man City **H** (lost) Stoke **A** (either way). Hard to predict them. A lot rides on what happens when we play them I think. Will decide whether they just romp on through to 2015 or get caught up in the battle.

My prediction: **4 points** from the next 4 games.

***Leicester City***

Very hard Christmas; coming into these games without a win since September, which is why it was so important that we beat them. I wouldn't like the look of any of these games. Man City **A** (lose) West Ham **H** (lose) Tottenham **A** (lose IMO) Hull **A** (either way). If Leicester aren't careful they could be cut adrift from the rest of the league by January.

My prediction: **1 point** from the next 4 games.

***Burnley***

Now that is a Christmas run in you don't want. Southampton **H** (lose) Tottenham **A** (lose) Liverpool **H**(lose) Man City **A** (lose)
Burnley are the draw masters of the league so far but I can't imagine them picking up point from these teams. Southampton will be looking for a win after last week. Maybe an out of form Tottenham but I think Palace was a blip. Liverpool no way and City. Like Leicester they have got a run in that'd frighten any manager. We stopped a 3 game undefeated run that might have got them through to January with their heads held high but I can't see where they will be getting points from now.

My prediction: **0 points** from the next 4 games.

***Queens Park Rangers***

Everton **A** (probably lose) West Brom **H** (either way) Arsenal **A** (probably lose) Crystal Palace **H** (either way). From my perspective I can see us getting something from those away games... maybe a point. Everton have got us after a mid-week Europa league game and Arsenal aren't in sparkling form at the moment. Hopefully we can avoid losing both of those home games but our luck will run out somewhere we may lose one of them.

My prediction: **4 points** from the next 4 games. Which would leave us at 18 coming into the next year. Which would be an okay position.


**Comments**

It is interesting to see that Leicester and Burnley have such tough run ins. If we can avoid losing to West Brom and Palace then things might be looking nice by January. I don't imagine many of the teams around us (barring a good run of form) will be coming out of Christmas with more than 17 points.

That being said, I can't see us maintaining our home form to January without even the slightest blip not matter how many virgins I sacrifice. Rob Green can't keep on saving the day like his alter-ego is Clark Kent. This is why our away form frustrates me so much. With a few away draws we would be several places above now and in a completely different mind-set.

There are a few other teams that could join this group. Even reaching as far as 11th place Aston Villa. I can see what Harry meant by Home-form being vital this Christmas. 

EDIT: One of the points I've forgotten to mention is although our away form is terrible. We have a lot more wins on the board than the teams around us and I think that the experience of regular wins is vital.",6,840,4,2014-12-08,2on1hf

superhoops,"Let's be honest, our away fixtures have been awful, and by the turn of the year we'd have played everybody in the top 10 apart from Liverpool and City. But at home, we've been winning all the games we have to win. And those away points are coming. The second half of the season makes great reading for us.

It's hard not to look back on those dropped points against Hull and Liverpool with regret, but we've really moved on since then. Another great performance again today, not entirely convincing but solid enough (had Green to thank for a great first half save, but even in spite of his great shot stopping he still makes me so nervous when he's got the ball because of his proneness to errors, he cleared a ball straight to Boyd (?) in the first half and almost gave Burnley the lead when he came to collect a cross).

Barton was great, Henry was very decent as well today, he's really growing on me. Krancjar was absolutely essential when he came on, he controlled the midfield and calmed the game down. Dunne, typically superb. A sensational CB, can't think of many better at 35, always steals the limelight from Caulker who was effective as well today. The full backs were excellent, Vargas had another quiet game, but we all know what he's capable of producing.

Does anybody else think Austin's red might not be too unfortunate an occurrence for the Everton game? We've been so ineffective away using the home set-up, so maybe a front two of Zamora and Vargas might offer us a different dynamic going forward. Krancjar should start as well.

**EDIT:** Also, Fer silenced his doubters once again with his performance again today, there's nobody else in the midfield who comes close to both creating and finding opportunities.",8,306,2,2014-12-06,2oh13t

After 12 years of waking up at 7 a.m. on the weekend to follow on television, I finally had the pleasure of going to Loftus Road for QPR vs. Leicester City last weekend. Most of my friends wondered why I didn't choose a bigger venue like the Emirates or Stamford Bridge. But I wanted to see a real club in a real ground. The experience at Loftus Road did not disappoint. 

All the Rs supporters were so nice to my family and I, and the experience was so refreshing compared to the corporatized experience of American sports venues. 

We happened to be sitting right below the traveling Leicester City supporters, who were riding high after the first goal from Cambiasso. Full credit to them for the ""You're SHIT .... Haaaaaa!"" chant every time Greeno hoofed the ball down the field. 

Despite some disappointing results this season, you shouldn't take for granted what a special club and community spirit you have at QPR. 

Thanks for making us feel at home.

______________________________________
Food for thought...

All 11 points have so far come from home games. That's a rate of 1.6 points per home game. We have 12 home games remaining. So we may expect to get (1.6 x 12 =)  19 points from the remaining home games, giving us (19 +11 =) 30 points. Meaning **we need to get a further 5 points from away games**. Where will those 5 away points come from?

Alternatively..

The more astute among you may already have noticed our home form has improved in recent weeks. In fact the past 4 home games (since our post-West Ham awakening) have earned us 7 points = 1.8 points per game. If we continue that home form, our remaining home games would earn us (12 x 1.8 =) 22 points. Leaving **just 2 away points needed for PL survival**.

______________________________________

**In conclusion**

To stay in the Premier league, we need to:

* Maintain our home form

* Win 2 away games

superhoops,"Next 3 home games are going to be vital (Burnley, West Brom &amp; Crystal Palace) Obviously we don't want to give away points to fellow strugglers but I think we can reduce their importance by improving away form (and there is nowhere to go but up). 

We are on 11 points (on just home form as things stand today - 01.12.14 we are 7th in the league) at the moment.Our away fixtures have also been very difficult at the start of the season: Spurs, Man Utd, Southampton (who we gave a run for their money), West Ham, Chelsea (Ditto like the saints) &amp; Newcastle have been tough as old boots. All bang in form teams (except for Spurs) and apart from Man City/Arsenal probably the best the league has to offer. 

I don't see it as impossible that we could get something from Swansea, Everton or Arsenal. Both Everton (Leicester) and Arsenal (Hull &amp; Leicester) have slipped up this season against teams like us and therefore we could pick up a few points.

After the Christmas period is over we have a string of quite average teams to play away, starting with Burnley,Stoke &amp; Sunderland and only occasionally coming across a top 7 side.

So what I'm trying to say is the Christmas period is very important (for points but also for who will come into the team in January and moral) but I think just as important is improving away form. 

If we can maintain home form, away form will be the decider of whether we stay in this league or are relegated. We have got all our points from home games this season and if we had drawn even two of those games instead of losing them we join 13th (on points) now and in the media's eyes that's a million miles away from 18th. 

Really to be on track by the new year we need to be on about 19 (round about half of 40 points, ie probably safe). So out of 6 games we've got to get 7 points.

TLDR: Our away form isn't as bad as it looks, all our away games have been against in-form teams (top 7). If we can improve this Christmas/and afterwards will look a lot easier. ",6,376,9,2014-12-01,2nxnx1

I am from America, Michigan to be more specific, I have come here to learn a bit more about my favorite Football team. A couple years ago my friends and I all picked a premier league team to follow, I picked QPR for obvious reasons, because they're badass and have the best kits in Europe. 
My fandom went from being pretty casual to more intense as I went out and bought FIFA the past couple seasons, this has helped me get to know who is on the team and what not. For Christmas I am asking for some QPR ""swag"" and I am totally hooked now on this team.

As a new fan I have some questions to help me get to know this team better. Adel Taarabt has been one of my favorite players on FIFA, but I've been doing some research on him and lately it seems he's not as cool as I thought, what are your opinions on him? Is he going to be out soon? Charlie Austin and Junior Hoilett are my current favorites. 

Now forgive me for not knowing the culture of English football as well, but are there team anthems or songs that I should know so that I cant chant or sing along while watching them on TV? 

Thanks guys, let me know if there is anything else I should know as a new fan, it seems the team has been playing better the past couple games, and have played well against some good teams, heartbreaker against Chelsea last week, hopefully the R's can stay up!",11,265,12,2014-11-07,2ljin1

Can we stay UP ? We need roughly 37 points (as is the benchmark from previous seasons).

I was disappointed in how we started the season (as I wanted to avoid being in the relegation zone for any period of time) but I have been impressed in recent weeks with our displays against top teams (Liverpool and Chelsea *who are going to win the league most likely by a 20 point gap come the end of the season*).

My vote is YES. But obviously we need to avoid injuries and get a decent striker come January - Not that Charlie isn't finding his feet but we need a backup other than Vargas. (I hope Defoe is still on the cards).

ALSO; REDKNAPP needs to stay. Regardless if we have a bad run of games. The teams that do the best stick with their management long-term (look at Fulham last season for example).

Here are the teams we potentially can beat (or at least pick up points) IMO (or have a chance too):

West Ham x 1
Swansea x 2 
West Brom x 2
Newcastle x 2
Stoke x 2
Hull x 1
Villa (again) x 1
Palace x 2
Sunderland (again) x 1
Leicester x 2
Burnley x 2

(probably about 50 points in there somewhere).

I think we could shock one or two of the big teams with a draw or a 90min winning goal as well but nothing to bank on.

Obviously we will have to get most points from Home but I'm not feeling as negative about this season as the last Premier League season we were involved in.

superhoops,"Kick-off: Saturday 3pm @ Stamford Bridge.

Last time we played them at the Bridge I went there expecting we'd do well to only get beaten 4-0 - we hadn't won an away game since they started making the ball round.

With a great strike from SWP and outstanding defensive performance from Onuoha, Derry, Hill and Nelsen, [we went on to win 0-1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20843072).

Just as few players from our 1-0 win over Chelsea were in the team, this Saturday we will field few from our win at Stamford Bridge.

Will Harry field a defensive line-up, that's designed to score on the break? - not a formation we've been used to this season. I'm not sure we even have the players for that.

Diego Costa and Ramires are reportedly back from injury and will be played on Saturday. I'd expect them to be subbed on. If we're going to face those players, now is a good time.

It's a Derby game and, due to our recent history, it's a game where anything can happen. The biggest thing in Chelsea's favour is Mourinho, he has a personality for high-pressure games and you'd expect he'll be well-prepared for Saturday. In addition Chelsea have invested in some very high quality players.

We are growing as a team, which is the most important factor. Our players seem to understand the importance of Saturday's game to the fans, there is a need to keep improving and there has been conversation among our defensive players about 'doing what it takes', implying the potential for employing 'dirty play' when required - I like to think we'll get something from this game.",7,272,2,2014-10-29,2knuyi

Points: 4

Goals scored: 5

Goals conceded: 5

Preferred formation: varies widely, but lately 4-1-4-1

It‚Äôs hard to know where Sunderland are *at*, as the Americans say, or what exactly to expect from them this year. They've barely kept a consistent formation, were uninspired when we met them at Loftus Road, but at home they have picked up impressive draws against Man Utd and Tottenham. 

Sunderland‚Äôs big goal in the transfer window was to pick up a striker. This was meant to be Borini, but as we all know, he would rather keep the bench warm as Liverpool‚Äôs 4th-choice striker than move to a team further down the table. 

This has rather landed Sunderland in the soup as they seriously lack firepower up front, and Poyet is left scrambling for a system that compensates for their weak strikeforce. Against WBA he tried playing Fletcher as a lone striker with Connor Wickham supporting from midfield; against Utd and us he played a 4-3-3 with Wickham, Fletcher and Buckley/Johnson; and in the last two games, played Wickham as a lone striker. 

Wickham starting every game might give the impression that he‚Äôs been playing well. But really, it‚Äôd be more accurate to describe him as the best of a bad bunch. From what I‚Äôve seen, when he has the ball he knows how to lash it, but generally speaking he is stationary and makes very few runs to look for the ball. Big guy, but a bit too soft and easy to push around. Danny Graham hardly looks convincing either, and will most likely be their cup-guy. Fletcher is a little past it, not having looked his previous quality in a fair while now. 

That in mind, I think it‚Äôs a safe bet that in January, Sunderland will seek to strengthen. Sunderland are the [22nd highest spending team](http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/wp82_eng.pdf) in the last five years in *all of Europe*, so don‚Äôt be surprised if they manage to conjure up another few million to drop on a quality player.

Until then though, Poyet should be grateful to his midfield for picking up the slack. Sunderland‚Äôs midfield ‚Äì usually some combination of Cattermole, Larsson, Rodwell and Johnson ‚Äì  is their biggest strength: robust and physical, high pass completion rate and retains possession like a mid-table team. Poyet has always been a ‚Äòsafety first‚Äô kinda guy, and just as was the case at Brighton, his Sunderland seeks first and foremost to be difficult to break down. Their forward-going threat comes from Johnson‚Äôs pace and Larsson‚Äôs crosses, as well as set pieces. Van Aanholt, the speedy left-wingback, has also actually been one of their best offensive assets. But with an ineffective striking force, it‚Äôs simultaneously alarming and impressive that all five of their goals have come from midfielders. 

Having said all that, aside from the striker situation, this Sunderland team actually looks pretty decent. They have two good goalkeepers in Mannone and Pantilimon and a pretty mean-looking defence. For that reason we should all keep our fingers crossed that Sunderland have very few points once January rolls around and they get a chance to buy a striker. 

However, their fixture list currently looks pretty sympathetic, having already drawn with Tottenham and Man Utd. Their first win of the season probably won't come against Arsenal or Southampton, but Swansea and Stoke at home as well as Crystal Palace away are points available for the taking. Once the 10th gameweek finishes, I‚Äôll expect Sunderland to have between 9 and 11 points.

Points: 3

Goals scored: 1 

Goals conceded: 4

Preferred formation: 4-4-2 (sometimes 4-4-1-1)

As of writing, Burnley haven‚Äôt scored a goal in more than seven hours of football. For a team that in the Championship depended on their goalscoring (72 goals, 3rd most), this has to be a concern. Their two prolific strikers from that season ‚Äì Ings and Vokes ‚Äì are both currently injured, Vokes having missed all season with a serious knee injury and Ings picking up a hamstring against Crystal Palace. Summer-signing Lukas Jutkiewicz is without a goal despite starting every game, but has nevertheless played well and is highly rated amongst the Burnley fans. Scott Arfield, the right-winger, in spite of a poor game against Sunderland, is a real handful, and has been Burnley‚Äôs best player so far. 

Burnley‚Äôs defence, however, is looking strong, having put up three clean sheets in a row. Their backline ‚Äì Trippier, Duff, Shackell, Mee ‚Äì have played consistently together since 2012. As a result the back four, despite having no ‚Äòstars‚Äô or household names, seem congruent, calm and confident. They aren‚Äôt what you‚Äôd call modern defenders, with adventurous wingers and ‚Äòplaying centrebacks‚Äô, but they‚Äôre quite happy to play deep all game, go narrow when the opposition attacks, and head away crosses all day long. This has worked a treat against teams who opt to play with a lot of long balls (the home draw to United being the most notable), but has been less efficient against teams who like to keep the ball on the ground and play with pace (Swansea and Chelsea).  

In spite of their inauspicious scoring habits and lack of points, Dyche urges calm. With two key strikers missing but the defence nevertheless functioning, the general mood around Burnley is that if they can remain resilient defensively, the points will come once they get some attacking prowess back.

Even though Burnley are pretty much universally considered relegation favourites, they have made a habit of exceeding expectations. Last season their bright start surprised many, and they were widely expected to be unable to keep up the pace due to the narrowness of their squad. But instead, they just kept getting stronger and stronger, and ended up earning automatic promotion comfortably. For that reason I would encourage everyone not to write them off, as they may yet become a team that punches above their weight. 

However, they are currently at a crucial stage of their season. If they start picking up points now, then the awkward start to the season will hardly have mattered; but if they don‚Äôt, they will soon find themselves in deep water. Since Everton and Arsenal are tough games to get points from, it‚Äôs the next couple of games which will prove most important. West Brom would be their best chance to pick up points, as Leicester and West Ham have both looked very strong. 

All in all, based on what I‚Äôve seen of Burnley, I think it‚Äôs probable that they‚Äôll finish their 10th gameweek with 5-8 points.

The other goals though, Rooney's in particular, should have been saved. But Greeno wasn't the reason we lost.
The whole approach to the game was a recipe for disaster. United have a pretty inconsistent backline, which we did not exploit, and the only reason as to why they haven't won beforehand. Playing Clint as LB was again not the right approach. Within minutes Traore made an impact and if he could shoot, then we probably would have tested De Gea. Phillips probably should have scored that scramble in the first half too.

I enjoyed a summer of being happy to be a QPR fan but I knew once we got a battering/beaten soundly some of the Bipolar QPR fans would be calling for ""Harry OUT"". This was generally not what happened last year in the Championship (probably because we won most games).

These are mostly the online fans I find (tweets and forum). 
An example is: http://www.wearetherangersboys.com/forum/showthread.php?182577-All-Aboard-The-Gravy-Train&amp;s=dd6e926e8c010147bc8d8155e0c9c2d7

The ones at the games are more realistic and this subreddit is more sane. But I was thinking why do we have fans like that ?

I think it comes from the years of being the so-called richest club in the football league. The expectations of some fans seems to be bizarre, when we sign someone like Ferdinand or Vargas we are going to be pushing for Europa league and when we lose 4-0 to Spurs (a team who collectively must be worth about 4 times more than ours and pushing for champions league and would have probably battered most teams on their first game at home) we are already relegated. We are not rivals to Spurs, we are not Arsenal. Maybe if we stay up for 3 years we can take a different view on a game like that.

I wish some people could have the perspective of nearly going into administration just over a decade ago. Here are the expectations we should have for this year: Try to stay up. This is the same for every promoted team and half the league. This season is a gift. We were one shot on target away from not making it. We are lucky to have the staff we have at the moment and we are lucky to have got rid of some of the horrid players we have signed over the past few years.

I thought I'd drag up a thread from 2 years ago too discuss our summer transfer window. (Not digging out doeboy at all) but you can see how much opinions change and how quickly. 

I remember that transfer window well because I remember being at a wedding saying to a friend (Norwich supporter, now in our position last season) that we had signed too many quality players to go down (Julio Cesar ! Remember when you heard we signed him !). I was also confident because of what Hughes said at the end of the Man City v QPR game ""We won't be in this position again"".

However we all know how that panned out.

I am feeling very positive at the start of this season but to be honest I was feeling that way at the start of that season. What do you guys reckon, are we heading for another nightmare Premier League campaign ? 

If we put a negative spin on our signing (instead of the positive one).

Caulker, Mutch and Fer were relegated with their teams. Caulker played every game of that season and Fer/Mutch was pretty close to all their games.

Ferdinand played 12 games last season (mostly as a sub) and is 35 years old. Quality is still there but I don't know if his legs are.

Isla and Vargas are totally untested in the Premier League. 

We have never played 3-5-2 and when Harry tried too last season we got spanked.

Don't get me wrong I think we have a lot of potential but there are also worrying signs there that remind me of that season. I never gave up on the team, but there were times I was embarrassed to be a QPR fan (Bosingwa for example) in that season. Seeing Wigan going down swinging and us limping to death in a corner.

However the major difference IMO is how much the lads seem to like each other this season. Steve Black and Hoddle should make the difference. ",9,336,4,2014-08-22,2e9kld

superhoops,"I was thinking about the signing we have made for our PL season and I am actually really impressed. I could be eating my words in 6 months but I believe the board and Harry have made incredible signings. 

Defenders: Caulker, Isla, Rio.
Midfielders: Fer and Mutch.
Forwards: Remy (maybe keeping)

IF Vargas (counting my chickens before they've hatched of course) comes in we have got 4 strikers.

Rio, Isla, Fer and Vargas all have experience playing 3-5-2. Isla and Vargas already know each other from the national team. Both set to be on loan and need to impress to be signed. 

Caulker (and has played for Harry) came in to play with Rio. Rio came for Harry like Fer. After the Liverpool transfer fell through it appears that Harry has been putting his arm around Remy to bring him back into the fold.

It looks like a well executed plan in the transfer market. A thousand miles away from Hughes bungling ""just buy whoever's good"" tactics.  Of course we need this to translate into a decent season for us but I am really impressed at the moment. 

If Vargas signs I am expecting probably an attacking midfielder (a true number 10) and another Central midfielder before the end of the transfer window (loan or buy, probably at least one of them a Spurs player) and honestly I couldn't have chosen better players myself (for us to sign I mean).

In most of the major positions we have got at least 2 choices (of which I rate both as good).

Am I just being to optimistic after years of being confused with our transfer policy ?",6,276,12,2014-08-21,2e5z41

superhoops,"Thought we should discuss whats going to happen with Remy. 

So what we know is that he's got a Relegation clause and a Champions League clause. 

Relegation Clause is void because we are in the same league now. We don't have to sell him.

With Liverpool backing out that's all the Champions league clubs out of the running IMO. Chelsea won't come for him, neither will City and Arsenal don't want to spend ¬£80k a week.

Next up are Europa league clubs. Tottenham, Everton and Hull. Spurs and Everton may come for him but he won't want to sign for Hull. Extra money for them, believe it's up to ¬£15m (he's worth ¬£20m-¬£25m in my books in Ulloa is worth ¬£7m now).

The other clubs not in European competitions have little to no chance of signing him. Newcastle fans think they are a shoe in to get him now but I really don't think Fernandes will sell to a club that will possibly be fighting relegation with us next season at some points and he's actually said he will refuse to sell to them at points last season. Further more to Remy playing for us or some mid-table club is totally irrelevant same amount of games... same football. Newcastle is historically a big club but right now it's just a mid-table contender no better than Sunderland or Stoke IMO.

So I believe we have a good chance of keeping him for at least another season as come January (unless we are looking safe by then which I doubt) we won't see in order to try and keep ourselves out of the relegation battle. Obviously Redknapp likes him and Tony likes him. 

With Deeney maybe coming in, it's the first time I can remember when we are looking at the start of the season with 4 fit strikers who can all score goals.

superhoops,"Alright everyone. Seeing as news is a bit dry on the ground at the moment. I thought we could play a game whilst we eagerly wait for transfer news. What's your unpopular QPR opinion ? Something other fans would slate you for if you voiced it.

Here's mine:

I don't like Taarabt, I think he's shit and that he was always shit. I'm not talking talent because that really would be stupid but I'm saying that he's not a good team-player. What I mean by that is that I believe any team that puts up with him will ultimately be weaker for the experience. 

He's like the kid who wants to watch the game when his team is winning but will turn it off when they are losing. He's not good enough to act that mental, he's not Balotelli.

You can see it in the ways he acted when he was with us and when he did stupid shit like not answering the phone when his national coach came calling for him.

He may have been the goal-scorer who got us to the PL (the first time round) but I think his belief that he is destined for bigger things will always be his downfall and he will never achieve those things because of his ego. I have always felt this even when he was banging in the goals for us.

Secretly I have always wanted us to sell him and it's the first thing I do when ever I play career mode on Fifa !

I know this is not as unpopular an opinion as it used to be (say 2 years ago) but there was a time when I dare not whisper this even on the internet.

I think in 20 years time the likes of Charlie Austin, Clint Hill and Joey Barton will bring back much fonder memories than the likes of Adel.",7,316,17,2014-07-01,29kmta

I realise that was his first year in the Premier League and he's used to having world-class defenders in front of him but what do we do with him for the next 3 years ?

He's not a fan favourite, I'm alright with Remy being on big wages (if he stays) because he's a striker (who by definition are normally on higher wages) and has proven his worth but Julio isn't that much better than Green and Green has just spent a year with us pulling off fantastic saves and being a big part of the club even after Mark Hughes treated him like a (pardon my french) c*nt. He deserves a new contract but I fear they will let him go in favour of C√©sar purely because of his length contract. If that happens I would question C√©sar's commitment to the club because he is clearly here for his pay check. I'm not saying he was as bad as Bosingwa but still.

As it turns out Google Maps says I'm a tiny bit closer to Loftus Road than to Craven Cottage so QPR it is.  

I watched the promotion match and also the Four Year Plan documentary and then read a few bits on Wikipedia and some articles on here but I'd love any recommendations on what to watch/read to get some more background on the team history and also on where they stand now (financially and play style and strengths/weaknesses).  

Some more specific questions:

*I know a tiny bit about Tony Fernandes because I love Caterham but not much about him as he relates to QPR.  How hands on is he?  I read about him feeling like he got burned a bit by agents and contracts in the past and that he plans to go about things differently this year.  What is the general expectation on how he will be going forward?

*I read something about potential fines from the Championship over going over budget?  Can anyone give me an explanation for dummies and also any potential implications going forward?

*I know very little about Harry Redknapp or his style.  Any particular games to watch that would give a good sense of it?

*Any players in particular who form the core of the team?

Mentality and what they would add to the team (also not impossible to shift/would play in the championship)

So for Goalkeepers - Keep Greeno and Murphy. Get rid of Cesar quick! (no business needed)

Defense - Steven Caulker - young, strong and is a good leader. Could poach him from Cardiff for about ¬£6 million potentially swap someone like Samba Diakit√© with a bit of cash. Family still in London. Also fuck Cardiff.

John Heitinga - Years of experience at Everton. Not too old. Thought he was actually alright a Fulham. Could get him on a free, wages would be average.

Younes Kaboul - He's actually out of contract this summer, probably will be retained but I think he's fantastic. And he's not actually that old. Fierce and a leader.

For LB and RB, I think we could do with a 2nd choice. Traroe will be played as a midfielder. So atm we only have 1st choice for both positions. RB; Adam Henley. I like the look of him, young and also great potential. LB Mitch Hancox. Similar to Henley. Fast and young good backup and potential for future.

Midfield - Robert snograss - Powerful and smart player - loyal, a leader. Wants out of Norwich ¬£5mill. Would work well with Joey in midfield. Great freekicks and corners. Star of a terrible Norwich team last year. ¬£5million probably.

Emmanuel Frimpong - Young and potentially a good player. Could get him with a years contract, low wages. Could be pretty good. Know he was shit at Barnsley but his heart wasn't in it, looked good at quite a few Aresnal games, is an idiot but would have a laugh with Charlie and Joey.

Steve Sidwell - Best Fulham player by a mile last year. A goal scorer even in that shocking team. Already in London. Free Transfer (maybe) average wages. Hard worker.

Frank Lampard - Anyone who says that he is too old hasn't been watching him last year. Made 39 appearances for Chelsea last year (with cups and Champions League) England vice-captain, fantastic fantastic footballer. Don't give a shit that he's Chelski we would be honoured to have him even on big wages. Reckon we could get him for a year contract anyway.

Andros Townsend - We know all about him and we love him ! Would give us the pace and directness I felt we lacked for a lot of last year.

Kim Bo-kyung - Cardiff. Korean. Young. Experience of the Premier League. Thought he looked great in a lot of Cardiff games. Also fuck Cardiff.

Strikers - Gary Hooper - Could get him on the cheap, didn't do great last year but has the potential to be a great mid-table striker. Know what he can do from Celtic. Only negative is he turned us down last year.

Harry Kane - Fantastic up and coming striker. Maybe only a loan but I think he would see this like Andros did 2 years ago. Do or Die moment of his career.

Peter Crouch - The Old boy and one who I know for a fact would play his socks off for us. Would be a fan favorite. Worked with Harry before and knows all about us. Was at Wembley cheering us on !

Championship strikers that would be cheap and good - Lewis Grabban, Troy Deeney, Ross McCormack. All of them have a shot of stepping up to the Premier League. Ross McCormack would be excellent and if we got relegated him and Charlie would fire us back to the Premier League in no time.

Not saying we should do all this business, but 2/3's of it would set us up nicely for a good challenge at staying up and would give us a team that would handle a relegation battle well. If we sold Remy, Tarrabt and Cesar We would have about ¬£20-¬£25 million to play with and I reckon we could get these players for this price.

PLEASE GOD NO - John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joleon Lescott, Rio Ferdinad, Joe Cole, Beno√Æt Assou-Ekotto. To old, would be in it for the money and wouldn't give a shit about us going down.

Despite what Onuoha, Fernandes etc. said about promotion not being imperative, this will allow us a great chance to keep some players who may have otherwise left e.g. Ravel, Kranjcar etc. and the money from this will allow us to make some quality signings. I'm predicting Rio Ferdinand to join, Joe Cole possibly and maybe even Ashley Cole (wouldn't be for these myself but they'd be classic Redknapp signings, especially Rio and Cole) and some other gems too.

Watch out for the Match Thread in /r/soccer, it's predictably a toxic environment right now - top comment is 'Fuck QPR'. Class.

**Match Updates: (will update when possible)**

0' Kick-off at Wembley. Come on you R's!!!

4' Free kick in dangerous place for Derby...

5' Straight into the wall.

6' Corner to Rangers.

8' Long-range effort goes wide from Austin.

15' Good free-kick opportunity here for QPR...

16' ...into the wall.

18' Lots of QPR long-range shots going nowhere at the moment. Derby 55% possession so far.

25' Corner for Derby produces nothing much. Derby have had more of the game so far.

28' Penalty shout for Derby. Looks like a dive after replays, 

33' Kranjcar goes off injured for Traore. Watching this right now is nervewracking, can't imagine what it's like being there. Derby having all the pressure, and when they attack it's with rapid pace. However neither team has created any clear-cut opportunities yet. Hoilett with a good run into the area loses the ball.

41' Great save from Rob Green from an in-swinging free kick that could have gone in had he not been so alert.

44' Traore makes a decent run after a great bit of work from Clint Hill, but his shot is way off-target.

45' Half-time and it's **0-0**. Cagey.

***

46' Back out then for the second half. Come on Rangers!

55' Lots of Derby pressure, corners and crosses. Bobby is preparing to come on.

57' Charlie Austin misses a cracking chance from about seven / eight yards out. Agonizingly close. Bobby now on for Doyle. Best chance of the tie goes begging.

60' O'Neil sent off for a challenge just outside the box. Straight red. In my opinion he was not the last man, Hill was, but we all know what Lee Mason's like. It'll be a shame if it comes down to a poor refereeing decision.

Derby had huge amounts of pressure for the whole game, and unbelievably Zamora snatched it with our only shot on target in injury time. These are the moments that make life worth living. Premier League again next year, hopefully we'll do a hell of a better job than we did last time. And make sure /r/soccer knows about it.

Just incredible. Derby were pressing so so hard, then away broke Hoilett and after Derby had a few great chances to clear it, he kept fighting, won the ball and crossed it where it found Bobby who curled it around the keeper into the top-left corner. Truly unbelievable.

And considering our ability to deal with pace has been a bit of a weakness for us this season, as we saw against Wigan when Dunne and Hill struggled to cope, I think we might have a bit more luck against Derby, especially if we start Suk-Young at LB.

A well organized approach to set ourselves up on the counter and I think we have a great chance. I genuinely hope Zamora plays a part as well.",4,158,6,2014-05-13,25fwn3

superhoops,"I was impressed by the commitment of our players, possibly the most effort I've seen all season. I can't think of a player that didn't give full effort - though Ravel looked frustrated.

Yesterday showed me the capacity of the team. We are limited, with lots of individual skill. We have problems trying to break defences down, connect up as a team and our passing can leave a lot to be desired.

**Dunne**

For me, Dunne is far too slow, I feel for the guy. His attitude is right; his mind is willing, yet his flesh is weak. He can often defend set pieces, yet can't catch forwards, so pulls them down or trips them. If Dunne is the last man, we are very vulnerable. 

**Hill**

By his own admission, Clint is not a left-back. He doesn't have the pace. However, he is an outstanding centre-back and should be played there.


**Our best back 4:**The back line should be: Simpson, Onuoha, Hill &amp; Suk-Young.

**Hoilett** 

I love Hoillett's attempts to take on the opposition in their own half. He can be direct and , along with Traore, is one of the few players who will run at the opposition with the ball. He's either going to win us free-kicks in adventageous positons or he's going to create chances.

**Traore**

I really like the guy, doesn't always click into a game, but offers speed and, potentialy, direct play. Super fast on the wing. A shame he couldn't hit a barn door...

His fort√© is crosses from the wing. I don't see why he doesn't just keep crossing into Austin. It's how Austin has scored a lot of the goals in his career.

**Ravel Morrisson**

I don't doubt he wanted to win last night. He just seemed stuck in treacle. Clearly Wigan picked him out and dealt with the threat. But it still feels like he has problems getting himself into the right positon. So little has come from his conribution in the last few games. If he wants my advice, he should take a leaf out of Hoillett's book and just run at the opposition with the ball - but please, without looking for a freekick all the time.

**Mid-field**

Kranjkar has had trouble getting into games for quite a while now, not sure what's up there. I want to see Benayoun start on Monday. I hope Harry's been savng him for that game.

**Our best mid-field:** Traor√©, Barton, Benayoun, Hoillett.

**Forwards**

Austin had a few goes last night, but not back to his prolific best yet. Hopefully Monday will see him shine. Ultimately he needs more service, which was lacking last night.
I thought Doyle did OK, helping keep the ball up the other end of the pitch - he's not scared of a bit of posession - some of our players feel they have to pass as soon as they receive the ball or are within 2 metres of the oppositon.

**QPR supporters**

3,500 R's fans went up to the DW. The best vocal support for a long time. Well done to them. Now, lets do even better on Monday. You R's!!!

**The result**

Whlst we'd all have loved a win, the draw was a better result for QPR than Wigan. Make no mistake, Wigan put everything they had and more into last night. We have to be even more up for Monday night to get that win.

Are we ready for the Premier League? No way. But I like seeing QPR win games, that's what it's all about.

superhoops,"So we don't know whether we are in the Premier league or Championship (Regardless I view this year as a decent season) because it is extremely hard to go down and get promoted/make it to the play offs straight away the next season.

In my view our greatest weakness this season is creativity, injuries and goal-scoring. (Apart from some boring play) Until Ravel came in Charlie was our only source of goals and when we picked up a few injuries mid-season our flying start to ground to a stutter. Many people claim Redknapp is guilty of not playing the same team week in and week out but he's had to juggle potential injuries all season long. So because 
our squad is getting a massive refresh next season with the below players all likely to leave:

Remy, Barton, Taarabt, Julio Cesar, Zamora, Stephane Mbia, Esteban Granero, Samba Diakite, Andy Johnson, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermaine Jenas and Park Ji-sung and a few of the smaller names. A few will be sold and I'm thinking we will make about ¬£20-¬£25 million from the sales.

If we get promoted, I have absolutely no idea who we'd be getting in (also don't want to jinx it).

If we are looking for promotion again next year;

IMO - Strikers - Charlie is great but he's had to play by himself for the whole season. Stevie May, Lewis Grabban would be the realistic options and would do well. (Someone like Jhordan Rhodes is the fantasy one). I still think that we need 4 decent Strikers that can be rotated with injury. Maybe pickup Kevin Doyle on a free.

Defenders - Need a RB (Alan Hutton could be picked up on loan or brought on the cheap I know he's got a tempter but I think he's alright) and a decent young CB like Rhys Williams.
Midfielders- Creativity (as we saw this season) Morrison is the dream choice. Looks like he doesn't want to be at West Ham, probably could get him for about ¬£5million but would he play championship football. If not Chris Eagles could be got on a free in the summer.

Anyone got any opinion on this. I am looking forward to the summer because I believe it will be the clear out that we should have done at the beginning of this season and we can concentrate of getting in players who work hard and will like playing for QPR.

superhoops,"A friend of mine works with 2 Premier football league clubs. Yesterday he explained what happens when a PL team loses a string of games and even moves into the relegation zone.

In his words ""The phones stop ringing and every day in the [football club's] office is a bad day.... modern football is absolutely ruthless""

Apparently potential and existing sponsors stop speaking to the club as they begin to distance themselves from the situation. He said there is a kind of silence, it's common for cracks to appear amongst the staff as the pressure increases and a kind of depression falls over the place, some in-fighting can occur. It's not a nice place to be.

All of this affects the club's management greatly.

I reflected on last season and the absolute mess QPR was in. It's likely difficult to imagine the chaos. I must say, I have a bit more respect for Harry since hearing my friends story. 

The pressure football managers are under is immense. Fans, the media, some players the owners and then the clubs staff; when times are tough all put pressure on the manager. It has to be one of the most high pressure, high profile jobs.

My friend does not support either of the clubs, he's a Spurs fan, yet at least one of the clubs have become his B team as he's gained so much respect for the clubs, he didn't have before.",10,240,6,2014-04-12,22uau7

superhoops,"Baring a complete QPR meltdown and a storming performance by Brighton, it looks like we will be in the play-offs.

Under the circumstances we found ourselves in last season, our current position in the Championship has to be considered something of an achievement for Redknapp.

Looking at the team we have and the state of our clubs finances, I think we are justified in questioning at what cost our current standing in the table has come at and if promotion to the Premier league would be of benefit to the club at this time.

I like to see QPR win games, I'll be cheering us on to win all our play-off games and I hope we make it to Wembley. My fear is that if we do win promotion, are we in a position to capitalise on the opportunity or are we more likely to see a repeat of the 2012/13 season?

I ask this as, although Harry has got us into the play-offs, I fear it's been at a long-term cost. With loan players, aging older signings at the heart of QPR's squad, on-gong injuries and young players sent out on loan, do QPR need another season or two in the Championship to build a team of players that can survive in the PL without completely bankrupting the club?

I think it's time to understand who we are. We're still a Championship club trying to become a Premier League club. I think we should do that one step at a time, with a plan, rather than a short-term smash and grab.

superhoops,"Yun, Onuoha, Hill, Simpson.  It is tough to argue against Yun joining the squad based on the pace and quality he brought to the squad against Boro a few weeks ago.   Hill, while older at 35, has been a star performer for us on a consistent basis.  Onuoha and Simpson, both aged 27, are in their prime and, like Hill, have been outstanding at the back.  The only issue with this is possibly the lack of a true RB.  I leave BAE and Dunne out for good reason.  BAE had a strong run at the start of the season but has lost his focus and motivation.  If any of the loanees feel like a mercenary at this point it is him.  Dunne is simply feeling the effects of the tail end of a long season.  His form has dipped as of late and frankly we have better options.

Barton, Morrison.  These two will feature in the midfield week-in week-out, without question.  It is the other two, or three, that is the question.  Traore/Benayoun/Hoilett/Jenas, in that order are probably our best options.  Traore, Benayoun and Hoilett are all capable of injecting pace into the squad, which we are often lacking.  Jenas on the other hand was in superb form before his injury and displaying good chemistry with Morrison.

Maiga/Keane.  Lets face it, if we could get Austin I'd send back all the loanees in a heartbeat.  As it is we have Zamora, Maiga and Keane, might as well just flip a coin.  Honestly though, just don't start Zamora.

Apparently Green saved it, I returned in time to see a free kick converted by McCormack. ('14) Couldn't have got off to a worse start (unless they'd scored the penalty). Seems like our early pressing has been reversed too. Doyle almost went off injured but he's staying on it seems. Before the game 'Arry said we had three more players injured with hamstring afflictions yesterday - but he didn't say who they were.

45' Jermaine Jenas levels just before the break, lovely finish from just inside the box, so controlled. Rangers starting to play again. Corner to QPR gives Hill a free header, puts it wide and is visibly disappointed. Very positive scenes just before the break here, some beautiful play just before the goal too - three consecutive backheels in the Leeds penalty box?

*HT* Watching the analysis of the penalty - at the time I was livid that it was given because I didn't feel it was a pen, and the footage shows that Dunne does just about touch the ball - the lino doesn't give it, instead follows the ball as it rolls out and signals a corner, it was only the referee that thought it was a penalty.

49' QPR playing a lot better, stroking the ball about masterfully.

60' JJ booked for a foul after a period of hard tackling, mainly from Leeds. Vocal support from the Leeds faithful so far, summed up in this tweet I found earlier: 'Any team that sings ""(manager) giz a wave"" does not deserve premier league football. #QPRvLEE #leeds #woolbehaviour' courtesy of @patto1878.

63' Will Keane replaces Junior Hoilett. Minutes later Wickham comes very, very close to putting Leeds in front after Onuoha misplaces his defensive header.

71' Will Keane gets a good chance on the edge of the six-yard box but fails to get the ball out from under his feet. Ross McCormack injured during the clearance - wouldn't be devastated if he has to leave the field. He does so and gets stick from QPR fans, which he almost retaliates to. Looks aggrieved at the injustice done. Him and Wickham limping around gingerly.

76' Traore with a great run, lacking in support however and loses the ball.

85' Morrison makes way for Benayoun.

88' Henry booked.

90' Five minutes added-on.

93' Onuoha with a saving challenge on the edge of the box.

94' Hill scores but it's ruled offside. Good call from the linesman, incredible finish though. **Heart-breaking.**

**FT** Final score: 1-1. Fair result in all, disappointing result perhaps but shows that we can play well. A result to build on for the trip to Birmingham next week.",8,850,7,2014-03-01,1z9bet

**Barnsley 2-2 Ipswich** - two late goals saw Ipswich get a point.

**Blackpool 1-1 Nottm Forest** - Blackpool's 86th minute equalizer went our way in denying Forest all three points.

**Bolton 2-2 Bournemouth**

**Brighton 1-0 Doncaster**

**Burnley 3-1 Millwall** - a win for Burnley today means they move above us into second place in the table.

**Charlton 0-2 Birmingham**

**Huddersfield 1-0 Wigan**

**Leicester 2-2 Watford** - injury time equalizer for Leicester meant they came from 2-0 down to grab a point. Still a good result for us in a game I thought Leicester would surely win.

Players Out:

Even prior to the season-ending injury to Charlie Austin, QPR was in dire need of options at the striker position.

A frantic last few days of the January transfer window proved fruitful as QPR landed four new strikers.  After failing to impress with only 3 goals in 31 games, Modibo Maiga, 26, comes in on loan from West Ham.  A Mali international player, Maiga experienced success for Le Mans early in his career, scoring 15 goals in 69 games.  His form continued following a ‚Ç¨3M transfer to Sochaux, where Maiga scored 24 goals in 59 for the French Ligue 1 side.

Kevin Doyle, 30, also finds himself on loan to QPR for the remainder of the season.  Kevin has varying levels of Premier league and Championship experience to his name as well as a decent scoring record, with 9 goals scored on average over his last 9 seasons.  Despite running into his thirties, Kevin is a long-time Ireland international with a Scottish Premier Division and English Championship trophy to his name.

Will Keane and Guilherme Dellatorre, both 21, come into the squad rather unproven.  Previously a Manchester United player, Redknapp had this to say about Keane, ""Will is a young player with fantastic potential. He‚Äôs got a good eye for goal, leads the line well and will provide us with good competition in the final third. We're looking forward to welcoming him into the squad.""  Dellatorre, a Brazilian, experienced brief success in the second league of Portuguese football and similarly in Brazil's top division.

On the defensive front, QPR welcomes Aaron Hughes and Coll Donaldson.  Donaldson, only 18, was signed after impressing for Scottish 2nd tier side Livingston.  While not expected to see first-team action for a few years, Redknapp is hopeful that Donaldson can develop into a solid defender.  Hughes on the other hand, seems poised for first team action as our primary right-back, Danny Simpson, is out for an extended period of time with a back injury.  Hughes, 34, has been a constant presence in the Premier League over the last decade.  Hughes has also amassed a vast amount of experience at the international level as well, playing for Northern Ireland, and should fit into the Championship with no problems.",6,397,3,2014-02-03,1ww7h6

They're fairly close to where I'll be going to school (UCL) and I think I could afford maybe an occasional game -- whereas, at the larger clubs, I probably couldn't afford to at all. Haha.

superhoops,"Many R's are left asking the same questions after today's embarrassing loss against an up-and-coming Everton side.  While most R's expected a loss, they half-hoped we'd be able to keep it interesting.  It was about as interesting for the R's as their attacking record as of late, a paltry 2 goals in 5 games.  I mean, Blackpool of all teams who sit at 12th in the table, were able to hold off the likes of Manchester City as they fought to a 1-1 draw.


If we consider ourselves Promotion contenders, then certainly being able to match up with and compete with PL clubs is the true goal.  We've barely looked as if we can compete with teams in our own division as of late.  Yet by some miracle we are only a single point off of an automatic promotion place.  That miracle however, has a real name, the back four.  Benoit Assou-Ekotto, Clint Hill, Richard Dunne, Danny Simpson, and more recently, Nedum Onouha.  With the exception of Hill and Dunne, now in their mid-thirties, I would have no concerns believing the others could compete in the Premiership.  


The problem has never been our defence though, it has always come from *higher* up the pitch.  Midfield, but more so attack, is where it all breaks down.  Playing up front with Charlie Austin is... you guessed it, nobody.  There is no one playing up front with Charlie Austin most of the time. Somehow Austin still finds a way to make a goal out of it and that has been our saving grace. On some days we can get Andy Johnson into the action for 45 minutes but thus far his fitness has been the real problem.  There's also Bobby Zam... oh never mind, there is no body else.  The addition of Hitchcock back into the side is positive but it will surely take at least one more from the transfer market to get us back in business.  Going forward with Charlie Austin, Tom Hitchcock, Andy Johnson and a January transfer, would surely be a step in the right direction.  And steps they must surely be, for if we take too big a step in too short a time, as we have in previous transfer windows, we will ruin our progress and fall off the ladder completely.

For this reason, the midfield can stay the same.  Between Joey Barton and Matt Phillips, the clear midfield core, we have enough other options to get by in the Championship.  The only other midfielder considered Premiership quality would be Junior Hoilett based on his sheer potential, even though his progress as of late has stalled.  Between the Summer transfer window and our returning loanees we will have more than enough options to hash out a midfield competitive at the highest level of English football.

Today's loss may have made us look a team not in any way deserving of a place in the Premier League but realistically, we are not that far off from being a team that can compete in the top tier. One solid striker in January will go a long way to helping us reach that goal.",2,524,12,2014-01-05,1ufdkr

**Head-to-head**

* QPR have never won at Nottingham Forest- this is their 30th visit in all competitions.

* Both fixtures ended in draws when the teams were last in the same division, the Championship, in 2010-11.

* Forest won this fixture 5-0 in January 2010, but two of the last three meetings at the City Ground have ended in draws.

Nottingham Forest:

* Forest have drawn four of their last six matches, including back-to-back goalless draws in their last two games - at home to Ipswich and away to Birmingham.

* Forest have not won any of their last five matches played at the City Ground, drawing three and losing two of those games.

* They have lost two of the 12 matches played in front of their own supporters this season.

QPR:

* Rangers lost their first home fixture of the season when they were beaten by Leicester on Saturday.

* But they have kept a clean sheet in three of their last four matches, only conceding to Leicester on Saturday.

* QPR's 2-0 win at Blackpool in their last away fixture ended a run of five away games without a win.

* In 10 Championship away matches so far this season they have only twice scored more than one goal.

* They have scored exactly one goal in six of their 10 Championship away matches so far this season. On three of those occasions it has been enough for a 1-0 victory.

There was some great connecting play in mid-field but the difference was that it lead to something, rather that the slow dying out we've recently been used to.

AJ was tenacious in his constant pushing forward. Bournemouth's backline had to keep a constant eye on him and it was AJ who set-up Austin for his goal.

In my opinion: Harry chooses formations based on his favorite 1st 11 players available to him for each game. So if Austin or AJ are injured soon, we will drop back to 4-5-1.

**That ref decision:** Austin was more than 1 meter inside the Bournemouth box when the ball was punched away from his feet, stopping him from shooting at their goal. That is a red card offense and penalty.

Instead, the ref consulted the linesman for 3 mins then took the ball back 10 yards and gave a simple freekick. I though QPR fans were likely to run on the pitch and assault him. I've never seen anything like it.

Where can goals come from?

superhoops,"Being a Devonshire based 'Hoop, I grab opportunities with both hands to see QPR live, so a trip to Yeovil today was a must-do.

First off, the stadium I would estimate to be full (over 9000 fans in total) and our fans sold our allowance of approximately 2000 tickets.

Unfortunately I bought my tickets late so I had to settle for a place in the crowded Yeovil fans's standing terrace, and being surrounded by livid Glovers for near-on ninety - especially the last thirty - minutes it was a great experience, although next time I'll definitely be booking early for the Rangers end!

The lineup was rather changed from the outfit we started against Brighton on Wednesday evening, eyebrows especially being raised over Barton starting on the bench, apparently he is one booking away from suspension, if true then it doesn't explain why he was brought on for the late minutes, so I can only presume 'Arry was resting him, as from what we have all seen so far, a player possessing Barton's (newfound) traits of fight and determination will be much-welcomed in our bid for promotion this season.

Another point, albeit probably influenced by the Yeovil supporters around me - I have never seen a game where nearly all of the decisions went our way, including the penalty that got us our win - a good decision from what I could see despite being at the far end of the pitch.

The pressure after our goal was intense and unrelenting, however despite Yeovil getting a sizeable number of chances I didn't ever feel that they looked particularly like scoring.

Standout players for me were Benoit, Traore Rob Green. BAE was pulling off a lot of intelligent tricks and skill moves to beat opposing wingers under pressure, and also made some pinpoint cross-pitch passes, all lofted which required very little movement from the recipient. Traore looked particularly dangerous moving forward, especially in the first half by being an attacker who isn't afraid to charge at defences and work the ball into the box. His second half game waned however Tom Carroll performed his role well enough to compensate. Facing a number of difficult curling shots and driven attempts to his bottom corner, Rob Green pulled off some fantastic saves. Had he not been on such great form we could have easily lost the game 3-1 when you compare our chances to Yeovil's.

Ultimately a hard-fought, arguably-deserved win and more importantly three points on the board, keeping us top of the Championship. I feel our goalscoring form will improve as the season goes on and we will beat weaker opposition like Yeovil by three or four perhaps, though some good deals in the late-end of the loan window wouldn't go amiss.

Up the R's!

With the turning circle of a London bus, Zamora hasn't been at his best. SWP is winning more in the air than Bobby and in general Zamora looks disinterested. 

From the outset his acquisition puzzled me. As a QPR player I'll cheer him on, but based on his recent performance and apparent lack of effort, I'm not sure he should be in the first team. It was apparent how much better we played without him on the pitch; with Bobby playing it looks like we have just 10 men.

The surprise at the team sheet and the expected 2 up-front formation was audible at the Crown and Sceptre before the game yesterday. Many have been saying we should be able to play 1 up front and 5 in mid-field, particularly with the 12 mid-field players we have on our books.

superhoops,"We had to slash our wage bill to Championship levels but also add depth and skill to the team, ensuring that the players we were bringing in have the right attitude for success in the Championship.


Let us talk about our transfers out.

D.Cisse - He was on loan last season and took a free to some club in Russia no one cares about. Not sure how much his wage was, but he was initially a ‚Ç¨5M signing.

C.Samba - Let's be honest, Samba was a last second prayer to keep us in the PL.  It didn't work and now he is gone, back to the same club he came.  We got ‚Ç¨14M for him, and he was on wages of 100k/week.  Good one to get off the books.

J.Mackie - I think a lot of people agree this transfer may not have been in our best interests.  Mackie was useful up front and more specifically, had heart.  Regardless, we sold him to Forest for ‚Ç¨1.2M.

J.Bosingwa - On a wage of 60-70k/week, we had to get him off the books.  He took a free to Trabzonspor and no one from QPR is looking back.

L.Remy - Another huge earner at around 60-70k/week, we needed to lose him as well.  Took a loan to Newcastle, it wouldn't have made much sense for him to play in the Championship anyway.

A.Taarabt - At about 50k/week, Taarabt was, yet another high earner that we needed to offload to stay afloat.  Took a loan to Fulham which seems to be a good move for both clubs.

J-S.Park - Another huge earner, taking in about 75k/week.  Took a loan to his previous club, PSV, and got him off our wage bill.

Granero - Initially a ‚Ç¨8M signing for QPR, Granero was a flop in the PL and has been loaned to Real Sociedad.  Expressed interest during the transfer window in staying with QPR but wage probably offloaded for wage purposes.

S.M'Bia - Initially a ‚Ç¨6M signing, M'Bia had the heart to play in the PL but not necessarily the skill.  M'Bia expressed interest in staying with QPR but has been loaned to Sevilla, most likely due to wage offloading purposes.


Overall, we offloaded about 300,000-400,000 in weekly wages which, for a Championship team, could mean the difference in keeping us afloat financially.  We still have some big earners on the wage bill, particularly N.Onuoha and a few others, but their ability and heart on the pitch justifies their wage.  It is interesting to note however that most of these transfers were season long loans which means all of these players will be returning next season.  This bodes well if we make it back to the PL but if we don't, we could be in some serious trouble financially.


Transfers In.
D.Simpson - Free transfer from Newcastle.  4 or so years of PL experience and at 26 years of age, Simpson has a real chance to solidify a first team place in the squad.

R.Dunne - Free transfer from Aston Villa.  Older at 33 but adds depth at the back with almost a decade of experience in the PL.  Has had some problems with fitness.

K. Henry - ‚Ç¨1.2M signing from Wolves.  Three years PL experience. Slightly old at 30 years of age.  One of the big reasons he decided to join was Harry Redknapp.  Interesting to note, he was part of the Wolves squad when they were promoted from the Championship to the PL.

C.Austin - ~‚Ç¨4M signing from Burnley.  40 goals in last two seasons in Championship.  24 years of age.  Austin can make a difference up front in the Championship and has proven it.  He has been sloppy for us so far but when he hits form, we won't be taking scrappy wins any longer.

G.O'Neil - Free transfer from West Ham.  Plethora of PL experience, previously played for Portsmouth.  Adds depth and experience to the midfield position.  Older, at 30 years of age.

M.Philips - ‚Ç¨5M transfer from Blackpool.  Young midfielder with one year PL experience.  Relishes the opportunity to play under Redknapp and to make it back to the PL.  Touted by Redknapp as a midfielder with a bright future.  Plays for Scottish national team.

N. Kranjƒçar - Loaned from Dynamo Kyiv.  Has played for Redknapp before.  Talented midfield with an eye for goal, scoring magnificently on many occasions.  Seven years PL experience.

B.Assou-Ekotto - Loaned from Tottenham.  Previously played under Redknapp.  Excellent defender at 29 years of age should be a wall at the back.

T.Carroll - Loaned from Tottenham.  With loads of potential, he has a real chance to make a difference at QPR.


The majority of our transfers in this summer window have been midfielders.  Two young middies with a lot of potential and three older middies with experience and determination.  We added three defenders who will add depth and experience, especially Assou-Ekotto and Simpson.  We only added a single player up front and I believe striker is the position where we lack the most depth and would be affected negatively the most by a single injury.  However, if the strikers we have can stay healthy I'd say we have a real shot at making it back to the PL next year.",11,875,9,2013-09-04,1lprba

Rather than clog up the subreddit please post and discuss them here.

To get us started, a bit of a shocker - Julio Caesar to West Brom: www.itv.com/news/london/update/2013-09-02/west-brom-target-qpr-keeper

More plausibly, we're being linked to Tom Carroll and Assou-Ekotto on loan. I bought Benoit A-S for QPR on the last Football Manager and he did great, so I'm right behind that one. I have concerns about playing Clint next to Dunne in defense - much as I like them, they must be the slowest defensive pairing in the league. I'd be happier with a back-line of BAS, Hill, Onouha, Simpson. http://www.givemesport.com/375053-redknapp-eyes-double-tottenham-loan?autoplay=on

Edit: The transfer window is now closed - 11:01pm. As things stand the Assou-Ekoto deal looks done. Palace have confirmed an offer for AJ, and the rumours are that we have striker(s) lined up to replace him if a deal for Johnson is reached. A loan for Tom Carroll looks a realistic possibility. We also seem to be after Nico Kranjar from Zenit St Petersburg.

Edit 2: Carroll is confirmed along with BA-S. Holloway has reportedly said that AJ won't be joining Palace.

Edit 3: Harry has confirmed the Kranjar signing on Sky Sports News!",3,246,28,2013-09-02,1lknlr

One of my friends and roommates in college was from Manchester and of course a United fan, so he always tried to make me root for them. I had never been to Manchester though, and didn't want to hop on the winning bandwagon, so I said to hell with ManU. So in choosing my EPL team, I decided it had to be a team based in London, since I had actually been there. Like I said before, I didn't want to jump on some bandwagon like most American fans do and just start rooting for Chelsea, Arsenal, or Tottenham. For some reason, I felt a connection with QPR. However, I fear I may not be a ""real fan"" because in all honesty the way I was introduced to QPR (and most EPL teams) was through FIFA (the game). I really liked QPR's logo, colors, kits, etc. And, I mean, the name QUEENS PARKS RANGERS is just so damn awesome. But I didn't really know much about the team and its history, nor did  I even know of the team's existence during my time visiting London. Can I be considered a real QPR fan?

superhoops,"*If I have missed something out here or you want to ask me a question about the game, feel free to.*

I was lucky enough to attend the game tonight, and this thread will outline my observations from the St James Road end.

**0-1** To be frank, my view of this was poor as it was scored in the Big Bank net (home terrace), from what I can gather, the ball deflected off Charlie Austin into the net. His first goal for the R's in the second minute.

**0-2** Quality goal scored by Danny Simpson in the 53rd minute, just inside the box at our end, if I remember correctly. His first goal for the 'Hoops and not a bad one either.

**Points of Interest**

* Joey Barton played (started).
* SWP hit the bar and then the post, within minutes of each other after coming on as a second-half substitute.
* We brought 792 fans, a very good showing.
* Barton took all corners, which is arguably questionable but not dissimilar to the norm.
* Murphy played the whole game (thanks to /u/theagitatist for pointing this out).

**My Personal Highlight**

One of our corners at the away end drew Andy Johnson into Krysiak's net, where he responded to some positive banter with our fans and then preceded to have a quick sip of the Exeter 'keeper's drink and then pour the rest out onto the grass whilst winking and smiling at us. All of this was unbeknownst to Krysiak, and the corner was taken as usual.

superhoops,"Hi All,

I'm interested in getting your opinions on where we are with our squad right now. 
Obviously the transfer window is not over until 31 August, which is about 4.5 weeks away.

**Squad as it stands:**

3 x Goal Keepers

10 x Defenders (11 with Traore)

14 x Midfielders (15 with Traore)

3 x Strikers

**Strikers:**

I'm not impressed by the make-up and shape of our squad. Right now we have 2 strikers who struggle with injury, to the point one of them only managed a few games during the whole of last season, whilst the other is long overdue a major hip operation that may finish his playing career.

Reminder: We let Campbell and Bothroyd go, both proven top Championship goal scorers.

**Acquisitions so far:**

I like the 3 acquisitions we made in, Simpson, Dunne and Henry, they seem sensible and appropriate.

**Leaving:**

It looks like Cezar will go to either Arsenal or a continental club.
Remy to Newcastle. Bossingwa to Turkey. Mackie's gone to Nottingham Forrest. Taarabt possibly to a continental or Arab club. Barton may return to Marseille, if he'll take a big pay cut.


**More acquisitions:**

The Hooper deal has fallen through, tomorrow he'll be announced as a Norwich player.

We will be playing more games than in the Premier League and the physical impact of this league will mean taking casualties along the way.

I think we need 2 new strikers to avoid a bad final position in the table, let alone to stand a chance of play-offs. Otherwise I just can't see where our goals are coming from.

**Team ethic:**

In addition to this worry we do not know if the team issues of last season have been resolved, we cannot blame Bossingwa for everything, there are issues in the squad that must be sorted to the point we are more together than the other Championship clubs.

Am I worrying too much?

superhoops,"I don't know how many of you guys went, but I for one was there to watch it.

First off, anyone wondering why the majority of the away end was closed - the wall at the back is very temperamental, and there have been a lot of problems with the soil below it collapsing (which it did recently, causing the wall to hit someone's car), so it was closed for what I can assume were 'safety reasons'. This left the standing R's penned into a tiny area at the side of the away end.

The match, I think it is fair to say, was fairly dull but no more than could be expected of a pre-season friendly, and each team's first at that. The result was a 0-0 bore draw, where I feel we could have snatched a goal had we actually had a shot, rather than keep on trying to give A.J. a point-blank ranged header, no matter where the crosser was positioned (ahem Mackie). The Bosingwa banter was hilarious, and the triallist from Belgium was actually rather poor. It seems that our most useful signings would be Parker, Crouch and Townshend.

Another sight I was suprised to see was Granero starting, who performed solidly as the midfield playmaker in the first half, despite the heavily-fuelled transfer talk supposedly being held between him and Swansea. The notable absences were Taarabt (no surprises there) and Remy, who having seen today at Woodbury I'd have thought he'd start.

superhoops,"I've checked my coffee and haven't found any evidence of tampering.

I'm starting to feel optimistic about next season. I think it's down to the number of QPR players who have come out and said there was a serious problem in the squad. It's what we could all see, but during the season it's difficult for players to admit the issues for fear of making things worse.

Hill, Fabio, Green, Derry, Jennas and Townsend have all said the same, there were serious splits in the team, which were so bad even Harry couldn't fix them.

Everyone now sees the same issues and I hope will work together to fix them.

In a few weeks the transfer  window will open, Harry and the board will have had enough time to sort out a plan. The experience of last summer and the 2012/13 season should have given the board a very harsh initiation into football management, there are no short-cuts.

I expect a majority of last season's players to stay at the club. We desperately need 2 strikers; Johnson and Zamora will be fortunate to play even most games and with up to 3 games a week in the CL it's likely they'll be out injured before we are 2 months into the campaign.
I'd love to see D J Campbell given a chance to play next season, the crowd will adore him and he has shown how effective he can be in the Championship. Let's hope Harry takes punt.


Derry and possibly even Hill are coming towards the end of their football careers, it's time to look for new blood. I'd favor a slow transition, preferably bringing in some of the QPR youth and other players who have the potential of a long stay at the club.


Everyone at QPR and all QPR fans agree on what caused the issues last season, let's hope the board and Harry don't look for  more short-term, quick fixes. Instead I'd like to see QPR build a solid backbone in the team that will provide opportunities to bring in youth. Then, perhaps, we can again see a QPR we are proud of.",4,357,3,2013-06-02,1fiwre

superhoops,"There's no getting around it. /r/superhoops has not exactly been a great home of positivity, even as many of us our trying to look towards the silver lining of rebuilding a leaner, better prepared side to raise us out of the Championship yet again. I wanted to share my story with this subreddit in hopes that it will be a welcome read to the regulars who have mostly been saddled with linking stories of dischord and dysfunction at the club.

Last summer, I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/vm15q/redditors_ive_spent_over_a_decade_following_the/) thread in /r/soccer - I was headed to London for the summer, and after watching English football from afar for most of my life, I was finally going to be on the other side of the Atlantic, where I always told myself I would take up my local team - naturally, geography placed me right in the middle of a bunch of clubs, and so I had a choice to make. /u/doeboy73 sent me a message about the club, I did my reading, and I was pretty sure I was hooked. I went to Loftus Road and did the tour of the grounds, I became an avid reader of all the news I could get about the club - I was really interested, but I was not hooked.

Then one afternoon, out of the blue, /u/doeboy73 let me know that an additional allotment of tickets had been made available to the pre-season friendly up against Wycombe Wanderers. With a final to take at 9:00 the next morning, I decided to hop on the train and head up to the game. Unfortunately he and I were not able to meet up, but I had the time of my life, got to chat a bit with a few of the players on the touchline during warmups, and I was hooked.

I had to head back home before the season got underway, but of course a lot has changed since I took the train to High Wycombe - a lot of new players joined the team, too many results slipped away, Hughes took the team underwater and Harry could not get it back afloat in time. It became harder to find streams of the games as we anchored ourselves to the bottom of the table, but most weekends I was able to do it, and for better or worse I got up early enough to see the matches I could.

It will be a lot harder to follow the team next year, but between radio streams, the occasional television feed, blogs, and /r/superhoops, I'll be more than covered. It was a rough season no doubt, but it was also the one that exposed me to the incredible supporter community around this club, and it was the season I fell in love with QPR regardless of the results. For that reason, I'll have a hard time looking back at 2012/2013 with bad memories.

superhoops,"""The noise you generated when we battled to a deserved draw against the champions of England was amazing.

THANK YOU 
A communication from the club to fans often involves statements on club affairs or a marketing campaign to encourage you to buy the latest top or purchase tickets for the next game. It shouldn‚Äôt always be like that. 

 As a Board, sometimes we need to contact you just to say how grateful we are for your support. No sales tactic. No marketing ploy. Just thank you. 

 In January, the most difficult month of the year when it comes to finances, we hosted three games at Loftus Road in the space of eight days. And yet, your support for those fixtures against MK Dons, Manchester City and Norwich City was just incredible. 

The noise you generated when we battled to a deserved draw against the champions of England was amazing. 

 We, as a Board, are tremendously appreciative of the effort and cost involved for you to attend those matches in such numbers. 

 We are hugely grateful, and that level of support ‚Äì particularly the vociferous backing you gave Tony Fernandes ‚Äì merely reaffirmed his belief that becoming involved with QPR was a fantastic decision. 

 As I‚Äôm sure you noticed, there has been a lot of media coverage afforded to our activity in the January transfer window. Our intention is clear. To stay in the Premier League. 

 And we believe the acquisitions of Tal Ben Haim, Loic Remy, Yun Suk-Young , Chris Samba, Andros Townsend and Jermaine Jenas have improved our chances of doing that. 

 Tony and the rest of the Board are completely committed to the future of this club. Despite what you may have read in the papers, the club is not facing financial ruin if we suffer relegation this season. All possible outcomes have been considered 

 But right now our focus is on staying in the best league in the world. We believe we can achieve it. And it‚Äôs what you deserve. 

So, on behalf of the Board, thank you.

_______________

Last autumn, the Scandinavian supporters club was asked to make suggestions on QPR's most popular and likeable player. 
Not surprisingly our choice was Jamie Mackie. 

A number of other supporter clubs got the same request. 
At the moment there is a poll on a Norwegian website where Mackie is up against Arsenal's Jack Wilshere. 
The Arsenal supporters club is significantly larger than our own, and we could use every bit of help in order to get Mackie into the next round.

Our defence is now light-years ahead of the one that went to Old Trafford and the likes of Derry and Hill eat Cole and Van Persie for breakfast. With this year's results and the addition of C√©zar and Samba we can be confident of a very strong back-line, resisting most of what Man U can throw at us.

Yesterday's game showed exactly where our weaknesses are: up front.

Harry and the team have a week to prepare for Saturday, to work out a plan to get QPR scoring goals.

Townsend was a revelation yesterday, he can only get better. With Man U playing a more open game than Norwich, I see goals coming from our mid-field. QPR players always seem to up their game against the top clubs.

The Norwich match should be seen as a transition game, we must now face connecting up the 3 sections of the team: from defence to mid-field, to attack. Turning QPR into a complete football team for the first time this season.

Expect to see Fergie red-faced and fuming after the game, claiming all sorts of injustices and a summer transfer request for C√©zar.

For our only clear chance to be a penalty against a rather poor Norwich outfit is massively underwhelming. 

If there was one game we needed Remy for it was this one. Massive loss for us, lets just pray its nothing long-term and he can stay fit for a while...

For me the biggest positive was Andros Townsend - he was very impressive, looked lively throughout and wasn't afraid to shoot, drawing a smart save from Bunn in the second half. Julio Cesar was pulling the kind of heroics we expect from him now, and Samba looked as solid as we'd expect, if a little unfit.

This game is even more important. It's not the manager who's on the line this time, but survival. We simply have to start picking up wins, and there is no time to do that's better than now.

After initially saying that he was not expecting to play this week, there are now reports that Samba is now set to make his debut. 

Hughton was at Loftus Road when we drew with City. He has since praised the structure of our play and emphasised that hard work will be central to beating us. Their new signing Luciano Becchio is in the squad. Norwich now sit seven points above the relegation places; from their last three games they've managed two draws. In other words, they see this as a great game to pick up points to safeguard them from the drop-zone.

Which, all in all, means that it's gonna be a tough one. Hope the crowd turns up to cheer on the team. We're going to need all the fight we can muster. Come on you R's.

Historically, 10-11 wins have been enough to ensure Premier League survival, so it is likely that QPR will have to win three in five from here on in. A difficult test for a side that currently finds them self bottom of the table.

In total, ten players were loaned from the club. In particular, long-standing QPR player Alejandro Faurlin was loaned to Italian side Palermo. Faurlin was signed for ¬£4M in the 2009/2010 season and enjoyed regular first team football while in the Championship. Redknapp has said that the Argentinian is still in his plans for the future so it looks as if the loan move was simple an attempt to decrease the wage bill. Djibil Cisse, only brought in last season, also found himself on loan, to Qatar side Al-Gharafa. Enjoying 6 goals in 7 apps last season, Cisse's effectiveness seems to have diminished this year and his determination upfront has come under question. Other players loaned out include Rob Hulse and Anton Ferdinand.

On the way in, QPR made two record signings in what Tony Fernandes and Harry Redknapp believe could be essential to another season in England's top flight league. Loic Remy, 25, comes in from French club Marseille, for a staggering ‚Ç¨10.5M. Scoring 27 goals in 60 apps in his first two season at Marseille, it is hoped that his presence up front will be exactly what QPR needs.

In addition to Samba, Tal Ben Haim and Suk-Young Youn have joined the squad in an effort to strengthen the back four. An injection in the midfield comes in the form of Tottenham players, Jermaine Jenas and youngster Andros Townsend. Both were last day signings, it is hoped they can bring the quality and creativity that QPR needs to ensure survival.

superhoops,"Congratulations MK Dons. You deserved the win.


I was at the game with a Lazio fan. He remarked that ¬£2.50 a goal was good value. It's just a shame it came from Sunday-league-level footie. And *""Are they [QPR] always this shit?""* A good question.


Rangers fans were pretty much silent the entire game, aside from some booing as the game progressed. MK Dons fans sung for most of the match. The Dons took their chances, of which there were about 4. But that's all they needed for 3 goals, plus an early gift from Traor√©.


There are rumours we played a back four. I remember seeing Tal Ben Haim defending our goal, beyond that  Ferdinand maintained perfectly white sparkly shorts for the 90+ mins.


I appreciate that we should try not to single-out individuals, but.... Ferdinand and Park plumbed new depths. Ferdinand didn't want to be on the pitch and was embarrassingly bad. Park was basically booed to the point Harry took pity on him and, considering the potential threat to shirt sales, replaced him with the still-un-fit Bobby Zamora; who did his usual thing of moving around in the opposition half whilst looking back at our goal and generally bumping into opposition players whilst fumbling the ball at his feet (sorry, those who know me are aware I'm not a Zamora fan).


**Player performance:**


**Granero:** Scrappy, very poor quality play. In the second half he started trying to win the game on his own. Schoolboy football. A massive disappointment.

**Faurlin:** Awful possession. Very poor pass completion. Terrible positional play. I hate to say it, but he seems to be getting worse with each game. A shadow of his former self.

**Green:** Seemed to be half asleep. Spent a lot of time complaining at the defence and referee, with some justification. He didn't seem bothered with the game.

**Park**: At times people stared at him, wondering what he was actually doing. Scraping for the ball and throwing himself at opposition players, whilst barely staying on his feet. I am not sure he completed more than half a dozen passes. Being taken off was a show of mercy on Harry's part.

**Mackie:** 100% effort, terrible finishing. He had several chances to knock it in the net, that verged on open goals, but bottled it. We all love Mackie, but he often lacks the finish of a PL player. Today it showed.

**De Silva:** Spent too much time in the opposition box and little time defending the QPR goal. Was easily caught out by simple Don's long-balls over his head. Seemed to be trying, which showed with the goal. Showed a lack of respect for the opposition, which cost us.

**Ben Haim:** Was a member of the Bermuda triangle back 4. In the 2nd half I was sitting in-line with the defence. He was one of the few that played in that area. Wasn't a good enough performance for a PL game, we'll see how he gets on.

**Zamora:** Was suprised to see him warming up at half-time. Did his general Zamora thing for the final 20 mins. Assisted the Bothroyd goal. Seemed more up for it than most of our players.

**Traor√©:** Scored an own goal. Actually looked very good for most of the game, committed to the game and kept going past MKD players on the wing. Impressed my Lazio pal. 

**DJ Campbell:** Often looked threatening. His disallowed goal was a goal, he wasn't off-side. Should have been more coordinated with his team mates. Would likely do better with more playing opportunities. Was often crowded out by 9 men in the box.

**Bothroyd:** A big tall guy, should have scored a few from set pieces. He wandered around up front a lot, but failed to impress and took a few poor shots at goal. Otherwise rather anonymous.


**Ferdinand:** The worst player on the pitch. As the game progressed he began scaring both the crowd and Green by looking likely to score own goals. Was half asleep and disinterested. It's important we get another CB in the window.

 

We played our second-string non-first-eleven players today. Some of them are on very serious money. There's no excuses, they should have easily beaten a league 1 side.


If we stay in the Premier league all will be forgotten. As it is that was an awful experience for QPR fans, will have done player morale no good and may have further harmed our chances of signing new players.

So much pressure on our goal and our inability to keep possession had to eventually bear fruit for West Ham. They had previously been beset by injury, unfortunately for QPR almost all Hammers' players were available for selection.

Positives:

* QPR are unbeaten in 2013.

* Remi scored.

* Another fine defensive display from QPR.

* Wright-Philips looks more confident with each game.

* We're only 5 points away from escaping relegation.

* This year we've been gaining points at an average of 2 per game.

It really would have made things a lot easier if we'd got a win today. We have 15 points and must get around 37-38 points, in total, to stay up. With 15 games left, we need an average of 1.53333 points per game.

superhoops,"After success against Chelsea, it seems Redknapp has found his formula of choice for playing against teams that are better than us. As with the Chelsea game, we played an extremely tight defence and midfield, pressuring the ball early and stopping the opponents before they could gain any momentum. Taarabt played up front on his own, holding the ball up and waiting to start a counter-attack.

A clean sheet is an achievement we shouldn't play down when we've only managed it three times so far (twice against Chelsea!). Neither is claiming a point vs. the league #3. C√©sar made some immense saves to help us get there, but the defence and midfield deserve recognition for their hard work. Derry was evidently the spiritual leader as others around him played a physical and pragmatic game. Nelsen and Hill have become a solid pair. Adebayor and Defoe are exactly the kind of players we've struggled to contain this season. That we kept them out is a positive sign for sure.

As far as the fullbacks go, I'm glad to see Onuoha given chances and making good; he seemed very out of favour only a few months ago. Fabio was one of our better players today. In the beginning of the season I was worried every time he went on one of his sallies forth into offensive positions (Norwich, anyone?), but today he looked in control, and very dangerous. Rafael seems to have cemented his place at United, so if we stay up we might get a chance to sign him. We should spring at the chance.

Unfortunately the other player we got from United was the exception today. Perhaps Park's age is catching up with him, but he seems reluctant to get stuck into challenges: whenever there's a 50/50 for the ball in midfield, it always seems to end up going the opposition's way.

Pleased as I am with the overall performance, I have to say that I still left Loftus Road frustrated. Unfortunately we're at that stage in our season where we need to be claiming points even from unlikely places;  draws are no good when we need to climb quickly. If Tottenham had come out and absolutely run us over, then fair enough -- they're a superb team when they get into their stride. But today, we shut them down, and we kept them out. And with the three golden chances that fell to SWP you'd have expected at least one of them to end up in the net.

superhoops,"First of all I want to acknowledge the tremendous support Rs fans showed. We performed almost the entire retinue of Hoops songs and demonstrated to the opposition what support is. Even when you're at rock bottom you have to cheer on the lads and we did that for most of the game.

Before the game I managed to get inside a Chelsea pub, they had a choice of individual cotton hand towels in a wicker basket or luxurious disposable three-ply hand tissues in the gents. We don't get that in the Springbok, where you dry your hands on your trousers.

3,000 had to wait outside the ground to get through 4 turnstiles. An experience that wound us all up and likely contributed to the energy of our support, along with the extortionate ¬£60 entry fee.

We started the game quite strongly and didn't collapse back into our own half as I expected. Mackie had a chance at goal but seemed to lack the confidence to finish and their keeper made no mistake. Within 4 mins one of their players should have been sent off for a 2-footed studs-up foul on M‚Äôbia, but got away with it.

Most of the play was Chelsea taking shots on our goal from distance as our defensive players crowded them out of the box. SWP was having a bit of a poor game in the first half and passes out to him on the left wing were mostly too far forward for even his pace. SWP had come on for an injured Hoilett early on, so wasn't a starting 11 choice for Harry.

By half time I was feeling good about our performance; we'd shown character and a great work rate, taking all they could throw at us.

At half time the same arrogant twat with the mic that insulted us the last time we were at the Bridge did it again. This time he said that some old Chelsea player he'd just walked around the pitch - to prompted applause - had won more medals than QPR has in our entire history. Chelsea have amazingly poor tact and, as we all know, terrible PR. I've never heard any club employee speak to visitors like they do. They really can‚Äôt help themselves can they?

The second half saw a few very close calls, where Chelsea broke deeper into our penalty box and Lampard had a goal disallowed for off-side, then the tables changed and SWP did something he‚Äôs never done for QPR before and scored a goal in a league game.

Naturally the Rs fans went nuts. Grabbing random strangers and hugging them is only to be seen at a football game and at an ecstasy-induced rave party. At the Bridge yesterday, SWP provided the class A.

From then on I resumed the standing foetal position I‚Äôd not employed since the Man City game at the end of last season. That situation is not something you can understand unless you‚Äôve experienced it.

Then, it happened. We won!  

Arrogant bald Chelsea twat with a mic: 0. The might Rs: 1.

In the second half, when Berbatov went to play in his native striker role, Mbia bossed Sidwell and Duff around so much it was almost embarrassing for them. He was dominant that game. Nothing went by him. He won practically every ball. Top marks.

And then Adel Taarabt -- what can you say? When he plays like that he is untouchable. His first goal was lucky, but his overall performance deserves all the plaudits he's going to get. I hope to ~~God~~ Allah he stays and doesn't go to United or Arsenal.

But to step down from the wave of euphoria, even though we played quality football, Fulham put in the worst performance a guy I overheard on the Tube had ever seen in his life. It was was definitely the worst game I've seen an away team play at Loftus Road since we were promoted. Before they got their deflected goal, they hadn't even had a shot on target all game. We also missed *a lot* of chances in the beginning of the game that we should not have missed. 

In other words, we're on our way, but there is much more to be done yet. Still, we got the morale-boost from a well-earned and totally deserved victory, and hopefully that'll bring more of the same. Onwards and up, Rangers.

Reportedly Wigan have 8 players out for this game. Perhaps this is our best chance of a win. 

QPR have the worst away record in English football, not having won away since Stoke in November 2011, so don't count you chickens.

Despite their lose against Newcastle, Wigan played very well, keeping possession for large parts of the game, forcing Newcastle into long-range shots.

Do we have the fire power to win a game? Hopefully Mackie will play up front again, a hatrick should do it.

I'll put us down for a 0-1 victory. If we don't win this I don't know where a win will come from.

The line-up was a pleasant surprise, more like a Warnock squad with a few extras. I have always thought this is what Hughes should have been aiming for from the outset of his tenure. The strategy should have been evolution, not revolution. We have a core of players who have been through the mill together and know how to play as a team. Adding talent here and there with the likes of Cesar, Nelsen and M'bia ensures we are also moving on.

Derry, Nelsen and Hill mastered defense in the first half, containing RVP and Rooney, like parents guiding kiddies off the pitch. Great to see. They successfully intimidated Ashley Young, which I am sure Fergie noticed - hence the substitution.

Kieron Dyer was great again, just as he was in the Spurs game. The man has something quietly special, he is 'Mr Assist', I just wish he was available to play more often.

Mackie should be playing up front on a regular basis. His pace scares opposition defenders. If Harry cam also get him to achieve a little more control we will have gone part way to solving our striker problem.

When Traore came off for Ferdinand the gates of Hell opened, goals rained down upon us. Was it all Ferdinand's fault or are we just terrible at defending set-pieces?

If we can sort out defending set-pieces and improve our shots on goal we will be fine.

We're in a situation where, even if we beat Southampton at home next weekend, we may still be bottom of the table.

We're unable to score from relatively straight-forward chances and our back four are still making mistakes.

To get rid of 5 strikers (including our top goal-scorer) and replace them with Andy Johnson seems to have been naive at best. Our back-four was largely a last-minute panic.

It was a repeat of our Emirates score under Warnock last season, when RVP bagged the winner. This time the ball was scrapped in from an off-side position by Arteta from a meter out.


I didn't make it to the game and saw the 2nd half on a stream.

We were obviously outclassed for possession, as reflected in the stats. We had some possession but the likes of SWP seem unable to complete basic passing even when not under any pressure.

Our defense mostly held strong despite constant shots from Arsenal. Cesar made a few quality saves as usual, despite a reportedly shaky start to the game.


We seem to have several long-term issues:

* Ill discipline: we find it difficult to keep 10 players on the pitch.
* Constantly offside: Now even Hoillett is joining in the off-side fun.
* Good players demoted to the bench: Faurlin sat on the bench despite SWP being on the pitch.
* Dogmatic faith in SWP.
* No goal scorer: Johnson out, Helguson gone to Cardiff, DJ gone to Ipswich, Cisse lost his mojo.
* Lack of fluidity: Can this squad click and flow?

If we don't get a win by Southampton I can't see Hughes staying at QPR. The situation is becoming more and more bizarre; we haven't won a game of football in the PL for 6 months, we haven't won an away game for one year.

Hughes selected the squad, it's his. As much as I crave stability at QPR we need to start winning games or our club is in very serious trouble, with so many ¬£multi-million players in the ranks; I don't want to see a repeat of 1996.

**+ points**

* Excellent passing play. Granero and Diakit√© both had superb games. Diakit√© man of the match for me.
* Excellent workrate off the ball. Again, Granero and Diakit√© worthy of special mention. It's not surprising that Diakit√© with his size and strength can both make and skip past tackles, but Granero really put in a shift today. He got the better of Anichebe several times. Huge plus for him.
* Mbia is looking *good*. Like, very, very good. 
* Park in the middle is a no-brainer. Why was he even out on the wing to begin with? 
* Hoilett-Zamora-Taarabt link-up is looking very, very good.
* To hell with individual mentions, everyone was bloody great today. I mean it: Bosingwa was awesome, Zamora did his job well even though he constantly had a lot of pressure on him, Taarabt awesome (good to see him play all 90 minutes), Nelsen solid (one duel with him and Anichebe was out for the count) ... it goes on.

**- points**

* Even when we play better, we fail to create and put away that crucial game-winning opportunity. 
* We still look shaky as hell from dead-ball situations. One shitty goal conceded, one off the crossbar and one heartattack moment in the second half where C√©sar bailed us out, all from corners and free-kicks. 


Finishing note: that penalty shout at the end ... was that as obvious a penalty as it looked? Because I was pretty close and it looked like an absolutely stone-wall penalty. Again, shitty decisions from the referee costing us points. Only surprise was that it wasn't Clattenburg.

* Hughes should be fired. Various replacements suggested, Harry Redknapp the big name alternative.

* Park has been a disappointment, both as a captain and a player.

* We need Joey Barton back to add aggression to the midfield.

* The defensive personnel (Nelson excepted) are not good enough and should be overhauled in January.

I've known /r/superhoops to offer more considered responses so I wondered what you lot have to say about all this. Could it be said that, in any sense, we're moving in the right direction? What changes can be made that will see us picking up points? 

Personally, I think the answers to these debate topics are no, no, no and no:

* Hughes has an awful record so far but we need stability now, not more unrest.

* Park should accept as much responsibility as the rest of the squad, but should not be made a scapegoat. The captaincy issue is a red herring, as it has been for a few seasons at Loftus Road.

* We have 5 better centre midfielders than Barton. 

* We have some squad selection issues (Hill should not be playing at left back, SWP should not be starting, Derry's inclusion in the team would help with organisation, leadership and concentration) but the personnel is not the problem. January would be better spent selling players than buying. The key to improvement lies on the training ground, primarily in stopping the defensive errors.

Sadly he died in a motorbike accident at the end of August while on Holiday in Thailand. And I only just found out at the game today. His seat still has his name on it, his brother now uses the season ticket. His death had been announced in the Chelsea - QPR brochure, I hadn't seen it.

It's difficult to imagine someone so full of energy is no more. 
He used to get so stressed and involved when QPR were not playing well; he couldn't watch the Heider Helguson Penalty against Chelsea as he had to throw up in the toilets, due to the anxiety of it all.

Without QPR I'd never have met the guy and certainly would never have shared such intense experiences as we did perched on X block with the other fans.

I just wanted to acknowledge him and say I will miss him. He added something to QPR for me.",4,250,0,2012-10-01,10sd5x

We lost discipline and shape after the 1st goal and in the end might have conceded more. But the 1st hour of football was worth the (substantial) entry price alone. To outpass a passing team - to go a top 6 club, away from home, when it's been pissing it down all day, with top-class ball players like Dembele, Sigurrdsen, Bale, Dempsey and Lennon all in the starting line-up, and to teach them a lesson in possession play, was joyful. We didn't deliver the result, but QPR were a joy to watch. Lots to work on next week, but lots to be positive about too.

Some of the positives- Granero had a fantastic first half, both disrupting the opposition and in possession. He looks so composed, and his corners were excellent. It's been a long time since we've seen decent corners. Ryan Nelson gets better and better and led the makeshift defence well.

Cesar commanded the back line, giving any QPR strikers who dared fall back an earful - I saw him berate Johnson at one point.

We lacked a finisher, though we should remember we were up against one of the best defensive line-ups in Europe.

Why start two centre midfielders with the intention of subbing off both? That leaves only one sub for a tactical change, which we needed to withdraw Ferdinand. 

He left it until the 87th minute to put on Cisse, our best goalscorer by a country mile. That's 15 minutes after our two best chances of the match had fallen to Ryan Nelson. The correct thing to do was, as soon as we'd gained a foothold in the match and were creating chances, put on our finisher.

superhoops,"Here's my estimation....

Last year we finished 17th on 37 points. No need for me to go into detail, most of us are still in counselling as a result.


Just 10 points (3 wins and a draw) separated us from 10th place.


In my view Cisse, Barton and Diakite sending-offs alone cost us at least 2 games (6 points), our mid-season slump cost us a lot more. We lost against bottom-half of the table clubs who were poor, at a time we looked like a bottom of the Championship table club. 

Even more than star players, this time we need a football team. If that can be achieved we will not lose those games.

So **my prediction is a modest 4 more wins than last year; putting QPR 10th**. We could of course get more, but I think with so many changes in the team there's a lot to settle down. Anything more than that is a great bonus.

Essential elemets for this season:

* Maintain our recent home form (that's a big ask).

* Win a few away games (the last time we won away was in Nov' 2011).

* Achieve a solid team ethic.

* Properly sort out our defence (A Ferdinand own-goal and Nelsen hand-ball in the box yesterday didn't inspire confidence).

* Hope Cisse doesn't get injured or go mental again.

superhoops,"With all the new signings and the chance to start the season with a settled team who have played together before I'm hoping for the best season since 1992/3.

There must be a real sense of optimism in the squad.

A few loyal servants like Buzsaky and Smith will not make it - I feel sorry for them. Smith didn't get much of a look-in, despite his screamer of a goal against Wigan and the winner against Everton. Buzsaky has had a few good flurrys of activity, particularly in Q3 of last season and free-kicks looked good, but I guess I can understand why they will both be dropped. Two excellent players who will benefit any team that signs them.


I feel we must retain our home form, then add to that with new away wins.

* Faurlin is back!
* Taarabt has the #10 shirt and should feel wanted now.
* A new proven keeper.
* Cisse wanting to score more after fantastic form when not sent off.
* Mackie!
* Park may be captain and his famous work ethic will hopefully rub off on to other players.
* Depth and competition in defence.
* A very excellent looking mid-field.
* Diakite signed a permanent contract with us.

superhoops,"Our memories are poor, some players have only been with us for half a season, whilst others have been injured. These top-ten lists are a little superficial, but can give us a chance to highlight some of the good points of the QPR squad.

So here's my list:

1. **Clint Hill**: For putting in a shift of work and showing a level of commitment and ability that's gone beyond the call of duty and any expectation. He is worthy of a top-half PL club - and to think we loaned him out to Nottingham before Xmas :-/

2. **Jamie Mackie**: Similar reasons to Clint Hill. Someone on ""Open all R's"" said ""Mackie gaining the touch and control of a PL player is like a gorilla learning to play the flute - I never expected it."" He's another example of someone who's stepped up to the plate. Perhaps the PL is not so far ahead of the CL. If this continues he's to become a true QPR great. And, if you heard him on the Open all R's podcast, you'll know he LOVES playing for the hoops.

3. **Shaun Derry**: At times he's been a little off the PL pace, but I often see the confidence that comes with great experience and some of his passing has been sublime - beyond anything I could have expected. I've even seen a Brazilian-like touch develop. His ability to stop an attacker and take the ball has continued unabashed into the PL.

4. **Anton Ferdinand**: Greatly improved in last 10 games, was on a poor run of form, likely due to the Terry saga. A solid defender and I think potential captain material.

5. **Armand Traore**: I wear Derry's name on the back of my QPR home shirt. Second choice for my shirt would be Traore. A mature, unassuming professional. He had such good form earlier in the year, I used to breath a sigh of relief when he got the ball. Plays with great intelligence and is the best of our Summer buys. Since he's missed a few games I've put him below Ferdinand.

6. **Samba Diakite**: For his first 2 games I thought we'd made a huge mistake. He had a record at FC Nancy of yellow cards as long as your arm and looked set to continue his bad disciplinary record at Loftus road. Then, something happened. I think he is the most skilled player I can remember seeing at Loftus road in my adult life. I can't wait to see him recover from the virus and continue into next season, what an immense player we've acquired. Would have been higher up the list if he'd have played more often.

7. **Adel Taarabt**: Last year he'd have been towards the top of this list. Dubbed ""the incredible sulk"" for most of the season, he didn't want to play for QPR and that showed in his awful awful performances. Clearly Hughes appeals to his ego, which has caused some kind of a genetic mutation as we see Taarabt tracking back and defending for the first time in a hooped shirt. Long may it continue. If he's still with us next season I look forward to seeing more of this work ethic. He troubles any PL team, long may he continue to mature.

8. **Paddy Kenny** Was number 2 or 3 for me last year. Was not done a huge favour by periods of awful defending this season, which now seem to have been sorted. Should be lauded by all of football for his efforts at the Etihad, but we're too low down the pecking order for that right now. Has been caught standing a few times during the season, hope to see him return to full confidence next season.

9. **Taye Taiwo**: The man's smile exudes love, I know that's not a factor for this list, but I just wanted to make a note of it.
Took a while to settle into the club, has become a huge brick in the QPR defensive wall and has an amazing touch at times. What about that free-kick against Sunderland? Wow! Looking forward to see more in the new season.

10. **Cisse** Don't get sent off and become one of the greatest players in QPR history, alongside Les Ferdinand.

Also....

**Potential new captain**: Ferdinand or Derry.

**Replacement for Barton in mid-field**: Faurlin.

**Have you noticed**: Ferdinand has a strict routine when he gets onto a pitch: running to the corner flag and going through a set of movements at the beginning of each half. He is also ALWAYS the last QPR player to leave the pitch, hanging on, wasting time until he's seen all other players have gone.

**Looking forward to**: Diakite and Faurlin return... Wow!

**Bobby Zamora**: Sorry, I'm completely underwhelmed. Aside from the Etihad game he's been unable to move with the ball. At times he looks depressed and as if he doesn't want to be at Loftus road. ""Holding up the ball"" is something I expect most professional players to be able to do. As a single ability is it worth the most expensive player we've ever bought in our history? I'm waiting to be impressed.

**Tommy Smith**: Do you remember him? He's in our 1st team. Got us 3 points against Everton away and scored one of the goals of the season against Wigan. If he were on ¬£50k a week he'd be given more of a chance, as it is he's on peanuts so is lucky to make it to the bench. Usually scores along the floor and has ability we can use. Let's see if he makes an appearance next season.",6,942,2,2012-05-18,tt1wm

superhoops,"Our final mountain-like hurdle awaits. We need at least a draw.


All season the final game against Manchester City has loomed. Early on I thought everything would be decided by now, so I didn't worry....


Let's get one thing very straight, I do not expect us to beat Manchester City. If it happens I'll likely book myself in to get my head checked. I hope Stoke do the business over Bolton, whose 2 goals against West Brom last Saturday came from a soft penalty and a WBA own-goal, only for them to throw their lead away through basic defensive errors.


We cannot put all our trust in Stoke's hands; so how should we play against Man City?


Clint Hill's said we should ""[Park the bus](http://www.ealinggazette.co.uk/sport/qpr-ealing/2012/05/07/qpr-defender-has-a-plan-for-manchester-city-82029-30918868/)"". That's all good but I think it unlikely we can last 95 mins simply lined-up in front of some of the countries best and most creative strikers, eventually something will go in, and then what are we going to do?


The old adage '*attack is the best form of defence*' should be kept in mind; keeping the ball up the other end of the field as much as possible should hamper even their top-draw strikers. So here's my suggestion.


Go 4-2-3-1, with Derry and Diakite (I hope to all the football gods he is well for the game) in defensive mid-field, with every player getting in Man City's faces - it's what Warnock would do, I just don't know if Hughes knows how to play that way. And Cisse starts the game on his own up-front.


[Cisse is annoyed he didn't start against Stoke](http://www.westlondonsport.com/qpr/cisse-upset-at-being5-a-sub8-against-stoke/?) and I think Zamora just isn't good enough. With Taarabt and Cisse running around at the Man City end of the pitch it should keep the Mancs occupied for a chunk of the game.


So long as Cisse doesn't go crazy with a Samurai sword or get sent off some other way we've got a very slim chance of a draw.


So Hughes, there's how to keep QPR in the PL; I've done half your job for you. Now get the troops concentrated and well-up for this game. I don't want to see a repeat of what happened at Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, so they'll need to concentrate and not look like rabbits caught in headlights.

If we've ever had anything to play for it is now. Chelsea have been playing lots of games recently and have 2 cup finals on the horizon, plus they are missing 3 defenders.

QPR players have had plenty of rest and time to prepare for this game. We play better against the ""big"" clubs and Chelsea have a ground not much larger than our own. We haven't had an away win since November, so we are due one.

superhoops,"Who'd have predicted wins over Liverpool, Arsenal and Swansea?


Well, I did predict wins over the last two and had a good feeling about the Liverpool game, but I'm usually overly optimistic about our chances against every team we play (I predicted a 1-3 victory over Man U, with a brace from Derry, so what do I know?).


Our form has definitely taken a huge turn for the better. As I write we are in 16th place, one place above Wigan on goal difference, yet Wigan have a game in hand.


Can we keep beating the big clubs at home whilst losing against bottom-half of the table clubs? It seems a very high risk strategy to me. Don't get me wrong, if we beat everyone accept Stoke I'll be singing Hughes' praises from now 'til next season. 


Next up are Spurs at Loftus road. I'm pretty sure QPR fans will give Spurs some stick, will the players break the odds again? Seems a big ask.


Then there's C*****a away. Their game schedule seems in our favour as they have FA cup and Champions league commitments, so could be a bit knackered. Plus, I think our players will be up for it.


I think we need 7 points to stay up. Can we get 7 points from our remaining 4 games: Spurs, C*****a, Stoke &amp; Man City?",3,226,1,2012-04-14,s9skd

superhoops,"After losing to Bolton today I am coming to terms with the idea we will be relegated.


There are [10 games until the end of the season](http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/Fixtures), after today's performance, short of a miracle, I can't see us winning many, if any, more games.


It's a terrific shame. I feel we have the individual players to stay up, but they're not producing the team performance we need. It doesn't seem so long ago we were sitting pretty in a sustained 9th position, I find it difficult to understand why things have gone so badly for us so quickly.


Perhaps it's something to do with the sheer amount of change at the club, it takes time to settle a team of players. It may also be the case that figures like Barton weren't in retrospect the characters we needed at such a vulnerable time.

Also I think there has been an issue with making decisions about whether to play members of the previous squad or the new additions, there's not been a settled team. EG: Mackie is an out and out striker, yet he is seldom played in that role, instead we have invested in other out and out strikers, so Mackie is played in a supporting role, which doesn't suit him. SWP plays in all sorts of roles across the pitch, whilst players like Helguson and DJ Campbell have been in and out with injury.


Would Warnock have kept us up? I was split about his sacking; My heart said ""keep him!"", my head saw he was loosing it a bit (eg: weird tactics against MK Dons and small rants after games). In retrospect it's difficult to imagine he could've done worse than Hughes has since then, though I'm not sure some new characters in the squad could have continued with Warnock, they seemed to have made their mind up. If I'm right we'll play against Leeds next season, will be interesting to see what reception Warnock gets from the hoops, I think I can guess.

superhoops,"Wonder what he has on QPR for the 23rd.

From reading his report on Boumsong I'd imagine a similar approach for attacking Gabbidon - to put pressure on him to make first time short passes. They'll also look to break at speed down the wings when Barton, Taarabt and Wright-Phillips are out of position - which is the inevitable consequence of our fluid attacking play.

What do you think?

superhoops,"Part of me wants to tell you to get out while you still can.

I could go into the history. It's an interesting story, but you might as well just Wikipedia 'QPR'. The actual experience of supporting QPR - what it's like following them day to day, and what makes them different from other clubs - is harder to grasp. I think it's fair to say that it's an eccentric club. We always seem to be heading in one direction fast, be it up or down (unlike, say, Aston Villa, who achieve a similar league position every year). This season is no different. Brilliant team performance to beat Wolves 3-0, followed by a strange and eventful draw with Villa, followed by a 6-0 battering by Fulham.

Eccentricity is also traditional in the players. Many QPR teams have been built around a mercurial, unpredictable attacking talent. See Rodney Marsh, Stan Bowles, Roy Wegerle or most recently Adel Taarabt (last seen on a bus heading up the Fulham Palace Road).

We have two mascots, both of them cats. The team walks out to the Darth Vader Theme from Star Wars. There is much about QPR that is difficult to explain, but feel free to ask any questions.",205,2011-10-02
superhoops,"First things first, I'm an American. I've always respected football in the UK but never had a favorite team. I've always like Man U since as a kid that's who I thought was best.

superhoops,"I agree, he doesn't have the time and space on the ball he used to have in the Championship and it shows big time. Against lesser teams he may be able to produce some magic but against the top teams he is a waste of space mainly due to his lack of closing the opponents down and helping out at the back. He just gives the ball away in the middle of the pitch time and time again and then  drops his head and relies on Derry and Faurlin to clean up the mess left behind.

I'd much rather see Mackie start the next match knowing that his heart is in it and will chase every ball. Taarabt just looks like he doesn't care. I can't see him moving back to the Championship and no one in England will want him so I can see him going to a small team abroad somewhere, probably back to France. I think all the rumours of the likes of Lazio, Napoli, PSG wanting him won't mean anything after seeing his performances this season.

I am genuinely gutted as I wanted him to do well for himself and QPR but his ego has stood in the way. I feel he does have the talent to do well in the PL but is just lazy more than anything and thinks he doesn't have anything left to prove. I'm intrigued as to what his opinion of his performance is and whether he knows he's been a waste of space and wants to improve or is just deluded in thinking the rest of the team are below him which is why he can't do well.",278,2011-10-30

There are [10 games until the end of the season](http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/Fixtures), after today's performance, short of a miracle, I can't see us winning many, if any, more games.


It's a terrific shame. I feel we have the individual players to stay up, but they're not producing the team performance we need. It doesn't seem so long ago we were sitting pretty in a sustained 9th position, I find it difficult to understand why things have gone so badly for us so quickly.


Perhaps it's something to do with the sheer amount of change at the club, it takes time to settle a team of players. It may also be the case that figures like Barton weren't in retrospect the characters we needed at such a vulnerable time.

Also I think there has been an issue with making decisions about whether to play members of the previous squad or the new additions, there's not been a settled team. EG: Mackie is an out and out striker, yet he is seldom played in that role, instead we have invested in other out and out strikers, so Mackie is played in a supporting role, which doesn't suit him. SWP plays in all sorts of roles across the pitch, whilst players like Helguson and DJ Campbell have been in and out with injury.


Would Warnock have kept us up? I was split about his sacking; My heart said ""keep him!"", my head saw he was loosing it a bit (eg: weird tactics against MK Dons and small rants after games). In retrospect it's difficult to imagine he could've done worse than Hughes has since then, though I'm not sure some new characters in the squad could have continued with Warnock, they seemed to have made their mind up. If I'm right we'll play against Leeds next season, will be interesting to see what reception Warnock gets from the hoops, I think I can guess.


What do you think went wrong?",342,2012-03-10
superhoops,"We wasted a lot of time at the beginning of the season trying to assimilate Taarabt into the new team. You just don't have time to expend points figuring out your best 11 in the Prem, and as doeboy says we've struggled to identify the best position of key players. The only two who made the step up were Faurlin and Helguson and it's no coincidence that the terrible run of late has been when they are both unavailable. 

That's just one reason. The signings of Barton and SWP have been counterproductive (though I think Ferdinand has been decent), and it's unfortunate that the team as it is now face a pretty stiff run of fixtures. If the takeover had happened earlier in the summer it would all be different - you either have to completely restructure or incorporate new players into an old system. Rushing through signings on deadline day left us without a game-plan or a system of play, and since then we've been the opposite of the coherent unit of last season.",175,2012-03-10
superhoops,"You only have to look at Swansea and Norwich to see where we went wrong. Instead of panicking and assuming their squads needed replacing completely, they built around their existing team with a few carefully-chosen signings and have blossomed as a result.

Look at the XI against Bolton. The only men in the team who played for us last season are Derry, Hill and Kenny. You cannot bring in an entire team's worth of players and expect them to gel into a coherent unit in less than a season. Doing so was just wishful thinking.

Obviously hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I honestly believe we would have been better off this season without making any transfers. (Well maybe Traore, he's looked pretty handy I guess...)",126,2012-03-10

Well, I did predict wins over the last two and had a good feeling about the Liverpool game, but I'm usually overly optimistic about our chances against every team we play (I predicted a 1-3 victory over Man U, with a brace from Derry, so what do I know?).


Our form has definitely taken a huge turn for the better. As I write we are in 16th place, one place above Wigan on goal difference, yet Wigan have a game in hand.


Can we keep beating the big clubs at home whilst losing against bottom-half of the table clubs? It seems a very high risk strategy to me. Don't get me wrong, if we beat everyone accept Stoke I'll be singing Hughes' praises from now 'til next season. 


Next up are Spurs at Loftus road. I'm pretty sure QPR fans will give Spurs some stick, will the players break the odds again? Seems a big ask.


Then there's C*****a away. Their game schedule seems in our favour as they have FA cup and Champions league commitments, so could be a bit knackered. Plus, I think our players will be up for it.

Chelsea winning yesterday was good for us. Their best way of ensuring Champions league football for next season is to win the competition, they also have an FA cup final to compete in. More importantly QPR are playing well, we just need to continue our great form to Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

I still think we need to win 2 of the final 3 games to ensure survival, which likely means games against Chelsea and Stoke - both will be very tough games.

If we've ever had anything to play for it is now. Chelsea have been playing lots of games recently and have 2 cup finals on the horizon, plus they are missing 3 defenders.

QPR players have had plenty of rest and time to prepare for this game. We play better against the ""big"" clubs and Chelsea have a ground not much larger than our own. We haven't had an away win since November, so we are due one.

My only concerns are that Diakite is reported injured and Cisse may not be available for the entire game.

superhoops,"Our final mountain-like hurdle awaits. We need at least a draw.


All season the final game against Manchester City has loomed. Early on I thought everything would be decided by now, so I didn't worry....


Let's get one thing very straight, I do not expect us to beat Manchester City. If it happens I'll likely book myself in to get my head checked. I hope Stoke do the business over Bolton, whose 2 goals against West Brom last Saturday came from a soft penalty and a WBA own-goal, only for them to throw their lead away through basic defensive errors.


We cannot put all our trust in Stoke's hands; so how should we play against Man City?


Clint Hill's said we should ""[Park the bus](http://www.ealinggazette.co.uk/sport/qpr-ealing/2012/05/07/qpr-defender-has-a-plan-for-manchester-city-82029-30918868/)"". That's all good but I think it unlikely we can last 95 mins simply lined-up in front of some of the countries best and most creative strikers, eventually something will go in, and then what are we going to do?


The old adage '*attack is the best form of defence*' should be kept in mind; keeping the ball up the other end of the field as much as possible should hamper even their top-draw strikers. So here's my suggestion.


Go 4-2-3-1, with Derry and Diakite (I hope to all the football gods he is well for the game) in defensive mid-field, with every player getting in Man City's faces - it's what Warnock would do, I just don't know if Hughes knows how to play that way. And Cisse starts the game on his own up-front.


[Cisse is annoyed he didn't start against Stoke](http://www.westlondonsport.com/qpr/cisse-upset-at-being5-a-sub8-against-stoke/?) and I think Zamora just isn't good enough. With Taarabt and Cisse running around at the Man City end of the pitch it should keep the Mancs occupied for a chunk of the game.


So long as Cisse doesn't go crazy with a Samurai sword or get sent off some other way we've got a very slim chance of a draw.


So Hughes, there's how to keep QPR in the PL; I've done half your job for you. Now get the troops concentrated and well-up for this game. I don't want to see a repeat of what happened at Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, so they'll need to concentrate and not look like rabbits caught in headlights.


Come on you R's!!!

superhoops,"**1. Jamie Mackie -** Just for his uncanny knack of scoring goals when we most need them. The man has immense bottle alongside his tireless workrate. The epitome of QPR.

**2. Clint Hill -** Pulled off a few absolutely epic tackles to keep us in games we had to win. Not to mention bending the laws of physics with that late back-header against Spurs (I think...?)

**3. Djibril Cisse -** Yup, 3rd for me. A born goalscorer and a player the R's had been crying out for. Banged in goals that needed banging in, when he wasn't suspended of course. That record of scoring or being sent off in every game... It just could not have happened at any other club!

**4. Anton Ferdinand -** Nearly always looks solid and reliable, he does not mess around when the ball is in a dangerous area and deals with it - exactly what you want in a centreback.

**5. Samba Diakite -** A genuinely exciting prospect. Putting aside how much of a maniac he looked in his first appearance, he has looked a class act ever since. The thought of him pairing up with Faurlin next year has me drooling...

**6. Sean Derry -** Not always as commanding this season as he was the year before, but has certainly had his standout moments, not least of which is beating Theo Walcott in a sprint for a loose ball!

**7. Heidar Helguson -** Back in the dark ages of the first half of this season, there was one man who looked head-and shoulders above the rest of his team, and the opposition defense in the penalty area. The iceman himself.

**8. Paddy Kenny -** Looked a shadow of his former self in the first half of the season, but turned it around just in time, pulling off some crucial blinding saves since the beginning of the Hughes era.

**9. Adel Taarabt -** Took his sweet time reminding everyone what a talent he is, but again, did the business when it was really needed. Still does at least one thing in every game that blows my mind. Hoping he'll get off to a flyer next year.

**10. Luke Young** - Remember him? I would still have him at right back over Onouha in my R's lineup, and he went on a bit of a remarkable scoring run at one point before getting unlucky with injuries. I hope he returns next year.

Honorable mentions for Taiwo and Traore - two brilliant, but very different left backs - Just a shame we can only play one of them at a time.",435,2012-05-18
superhoops,"Our memories are poor, some players have only been with us for half a season, whilst others have been injured. These top-ten lists are a little superficial, but can give us a chance to highlight some of the good points of the QPR squad.

So here's my list:

1. **Clint Hill**: For putting in a shift of work and showing a level of commitment and ability that's gone beyond the call of duty and any expectation. He is worthy of a top-half PL club - and to think we loaned him out to Nottingham before Xmas :-/

2. **Jamie Mackie**: Similar reasons to Clint Hill. Someone on ""Open all R's"" said ""Mackie gaining the touch and control of a PL player is like a gorilla learning to play the flute - I never expected it."" He's another example of someone who's stepped up to the plate. Perhaps the PL is not so far ahead of the CL. If this continues he's to become a true QPR great. And, if you heard him on the Open all R's podcast, you'll know he LOVES playing for the hoops.

3. **Shaun Derry**: At times he's been a little off the PL pace, but I often see the confidence that comes with great experience and some of his passing has been sublime - beyond anything I could have expected. I've even seen a Brazilian-like touch develop. His ability to stop an attacker and take the ball has continued unabashed into the PL.

4. **Anton Ferdinand**: Greatly improved in last 10 games, was on a poor run of form, likely due to the Terry saga. A solid defender and I think potential captain material.

5. **Armand Traore**: I wear Derry's name on the back of my QPR home shirt. Second choice for my shirt would be Traore. A mature, unassuming professional. He had such good form earlier in the year, I used to breath a sigh of relief when he got the ball. Plays with great intelligence and is the best of our Summer buys. Since he's missed a few games I've put him below Ferdinand.

6. **Samba Diakite**: For his first 2 games I thought we'd made a huge mistake. He had a record at FC Nancy of yellow cards as long as your arm and looked set to continue his bad disciplinary record at Loftus road. Then, something happened. I think he is the most skilled player I can remember seeing at Loftus road in my adult life. I can't wait to see him recover from the virus and continue into next season, what an immense player we've acquired. Would have been higher up the list if he'd have played more often.

7. **Adel Taarabt**: Last year he'd have been towards the top of this list. Dubbed ""the incredible sulk"" for most of the season, he didn't want to play for QPR and that showed in his awful awful performances. Clearly Hughes appeals to his ego, which has caused some kind of a genetic mutation as we see Taarabt tracking back and defending for the first time in a hooped shirt. Long may it continue. If he's still with us next season I look forward to seeing more of this work ethic. He troubles any PL team, long may he continue to mature.

8. **Paddy Kenny** Was number 2 or 3 for me last year. Was not done a huge favour by periods of awful defending this season, which now seem to have been sorted. Should be lauded by all of football for his efforts at the Etihad, but we're too low down the pecking order for that right now. Has been caught standing a few times during the season, hope to see him return to full confidence next season.

9. **Taye Taiwo**: The man's smile exudes love, I know that's not a factor for this list, but I just wanted to make a note of it.
Took a while to settle into the club, has become a huge brick in the QPR defensive wall and has an amazing touch at times. What about that free-kick against Sunderland? Wow! Looking forward to see more in the new season.

10. **Cisse** Don't get sent off and become one of the greatest players in QPR history, alongside Les Ferdinand.

Also....

**Potential new captain**: Ferdinand or Derry.

**Replacement for Barton in mid-field**: Faurlin.

**Have you noticed**: Ferdinand has a strict routine when he gets onto a pitch: running to the corner flag and going through a set of movements at the beginning of each half. He is also ALWAYS the last QPR player to leave the pitch, hanging on, wasting time until he's seen all other players have gone.

**Looking forward to**: Diakite and Faurlin return... Wow!

**Bobby Zamora**: Sorry, I'm completely underwhelmed. Aside from the Etihad game he's been unable to move with the ball. At times he looks depressed and as if he doesn't want to be at Loftus road. ""Holding up the ball"" is something I expect most professional players to be able to do. As a single ability is it worth the most expensive player we've ever bought in our history? I'm waiting to be impressed.

**Tommy Smith**: Do you remember him? He's in our 1st team. Got us 3 points against Everton away and scored one of the goals of the season against Wigan. If he were on £50k a week he'd be given more of a chance, as it is he's on peanuts so is lucky to make it to the bench. Usually scores along the floor and has ability we can use. Let's see if he makes an appearance next season.",942,2012-05-18

Personally I'd like to see Barton leave. I understand he has issues, he has an unsettling effect on the team and the club. We are at a vulnerable stage in our development, having only survived life in the Premier League by the skin of our teeth and with little help on the final day from Barton. So he must to go.


I was one of the people who booed Barton off the pitch at Loftus road, it was more instinctive than anything else. I'd had enough and hoped he would sort himself out, yet it looks like his issues run too deep, I suspect he's beyond help.


Tevez provoked Barton and like a well-rehearsed script Barton responded on cue.

Barton may be on a hurriedly put together contract, meaning he'll be difficult to sack. Nevertheless I hope his contract is terminated and he leaves the club without money having to be paid. If he does go I hope it's not on too bad terms.",188,2012-05-23

He was convicted of multiple counts of fraud in the 1980s, receiving two prison sentences. In 1986, in Milan, Briatore was convicted for 3 years for fraud and conspiracy. He was convicted for his role in a team of confidence tricksters who, over a number of years, set up rigged gambling games, which used fake playing cards. The judges described these as elaborate confidence tricks, in which victims were invited to dinner, before being ""ensnared"" in rigged games, that involved a cast of fictional characters, and realised enormous profits for their perpetrators. Later, Briatore was involved in the bankruptcy of Paramatti. He was convicted on various counts of fraud in Bergamo, for which he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison. To avoid imprisonment, he fled to Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands. He never went to prison and he came back to Italy only thanks to an act of oblivion.",154,2012-08-06

superhoops,"Here's my estimation....

Last year we finished 17th on 37 points. No need for me to go into detail, most of us are still in counselling as a result.


Just 10 points (3 wins and a draw) separated us from 10th place.


In my view Cisse, Barton and Diakite sending-offs alone cost us at least 2 games (6 points), our mid-season slump cost us a lot more. We lost against bottom-half of the table clubs who were poor, at a time we looked like a bottom of the Championship table club. 

Even more than star players, this time we need a football team. If that can be achieved we will not lose those games.

So **my prediction is a modest 4 more wins than last year; putting QPR 10th**. We could of course get more, but I think with so many changes in the team there's a lot to settle down. Anything more than that is a great bonus.

Essential elemets for this season:

* Maintain our recent home form (that's a big ask).

* Win a few away games (the last time we won away was in Nov' 2011).

* Achieve a solid team ethic.

* Properly sort out our defence (A Ferdinand own-goal and Nelsen hand-ball in the box yesterday didn't inspire confidence).

* Hope Cisse doesn't get injured or go mental again.

superhoops,"I agree with OP, but I'd be more than pleased with 10th. We have cover in all areas now, so in that sense the transfer policy has been 'safety first'. 

A great deal of goals conceded in the first half of last season came through set pieces - a problem I now consider to be fixed. On the other hand we don't pose much threat through set pieces either, so we'll struggle to pick up goals against the run of play. That puts more emphasis on our home form, where we'll look to control possession. Away wins will be rare. 

The league has a more direct look about it this season, especially with Allardyce and Coppell back in the Premiership. Even Arsenal have bought a target man. All teams pre-season should be practicing set pieces and organisation. Team ethic is hugely important - the big, direct teams will seek either to dominate or to frustrate, so we must be psychologically resilient enough to live with that. 

So my prediction is, loosely, we won't keep clean sheets when not playing well, especially away from home, but that we have enough about us to be above the scrap once we get to the end of the season. Final position: 14th.",208,2012-08-12

superhoops,"Wow! We are famous!

How can I introduce you to QPR in one Reddit comment post? I guess I can't. I'll have a little attempt here and see what happens.

During the 80's and early 90's QPR was often the top London football club. In fact, in the early 70's our stadium was considered an example of how modern stadiums should be built - difficult to believe that now. In the 80's we were the only professional club to have a plastic pitch, which we used to great affect.

Much of QPR history has been about emerging quickly from the lower leagues, doing well at the top level, being mis-managed, then falling back to the lower leagues to return again some day.

Our greatest players have included, Stan Bowles, Rodney Marsh, Les Ferdinand, Mark Lazarus, David Seaman, Gerry Francis [others here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C._players).
We won the League cup in 1967 and have been in several cup finals, including the FA cup final in 1982 (when I started supporting QPR) and the Milk cup in 1988.

The QPR stadium (Loftus rd) is set in amongst residential housing and there are plans to replace it in about 4-5 years with a 45,000 seater stadium, which is a big jump considering our current stadium only holds 18,200 people.

Hopefully other guys here will tell you more. [Here's some more history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C.). Also, you can use the links to the right of this subreddit for more info, video and even QPR music.",245,2012-08-31

superhoops,"Thank you for the congratulations.

For most QPR fans it is a double celebration as we have also got rid of Barton to an overseas club. Outside of QPR fans many still think Joey is a skillful player, that he is just held back by his disciplinary record. I don't share that view. I think Barton is mostly a poor player. So it's great to see him go.

It was the first time in English football history QPR lost to Swansea at Loftus road and it was possibly our worst league defeat since the 1980's.

As Kinners said, the manager should take the blame for that loss. Our defense was  untested since last season and so become slow, Hughes then set the team up in a formation they'd never played before and told them to attack. He then put Wright-Philips in the defensive line at right-back and waited until the dying minutes of the game to bring on a defensive mid-fielder.

It's great to have these skillful and experienced players in the team, part of the reason for so many buys in the past 2 weeks is to cover-up Hughes' tactical errors and incompetence against Swansea. QPR fans have had their hopes built up by QPR  media guys, the new players are an attempt to ensure those high hopes have a chance of realization, despite Hughes' short-comings.",227,2012-09-01
superhoops,"Wow, maybe QPR should sack Hughes and replace him with you immediately. Show a little faith, I'm sure that Hughes has a plan, he has been in charge of a team in a similar situation before (Man City). Faurlin had his first game back from injury and Granero was playing his first game for QPR. I was very proud of the way QPR played, going in to the game I was very worried it was going to be 5-0 again. Don't be so negative and take some positives from the match, Granero played well for a first game and looks the goods for set pieces, the boys were looking a lot more like a team instead of signings thrown together at the last minute and we still have potential starters and good players to come in like Diakite, Hoilett, M'bia and Cesar.",142,2012-09-02
superhoops,"So there were positives to be drawn from the 2nd half yesterday, but it was another inept display from the manager. My main complaints are:

Why start two centre midfielders with the intention of subbing off both? That leaves only one sub for a tactical change, which we needed to withdraw Ferdinand. 

He left it until the 87th minute to put on Cisse, our best goalscorer by a country mile. That's 15 minutes after our two best chances of the match had fallen to Ryan Nelson. The correct thing to do was, as soon as we'd gained a foothold in the match and were creating chances, put on our finisher.

*That was tough. We have so much depth in mid-field, it's very difficult to choose a definite starting line-up.*

*I also had to spend some time choosing the defense. We have a lack of left-footed defenders and I think we have stronger centre-backs than Ferdinand to start, plus we now have Mbia, surely one of the best full-backs in the PL.*

*Both Traoré and Fabio are naturally attacking-minded, so no matter how you line the team up we are likely to be pushing forward. I put Park in a defensive mid-field position to try and maintain a connection between the mid-field and the back four - in reality it'll be mostly a remaining back 2 (Bosingwa & Nelson) for most of the game, though even Nelson seems to go forward. Park's workman-like performances will be needed with 90% of the team in the other half for most of the game.*

The biggest positive, though, is that we are seeing real improvement: we're playing much better. Three points at Tottenham is a definite possibility. 

Also, it's perhaps a bit early to say, but Hughes's more dubious buys like Nelsen and Johnson have really paid off so far. ",108,2012-09-15

If I was being cynical, SWP continues to prefer running the ball into a dead end rather than playing the sensible early cross, and Zamora looked unwilling to get stuck into the 50-50 challenges, like the rest of the team to a man were.

The midfield combo of Granero & Faulin is an extremely exciting prospect. There were a couple of times in the match where they looked almost telepathic. It was wonderful to watch them link up and read each other's play.

Cesar commanded the back line, giving any QPR strikers who dared fall back an earful - I saw him berate Johnson at one point.

We lacked a finisher, though we should remember we were up against one of the best defensive line-ups in Europe.

Onuoha because Fabio scares the shit out of me when an attack breaks down and the opponents' counterattack begins and he's way too far up the field.

I feel like a dick leaving Mackie out :( but we have way, way too many quality midfielders now for him to be a starter. For the same reason, I think Park should start in a central midfield role: so we can allow pacier players to have the wing.

On a side note it's interesting to see how Hughes regards SWP as a strategically defensive player. He brought him on at right back against Swansea. Against Chelsea it became clear that the instructions to the midfield were to close down in packs, get a toe on the ball, then spread the play with quick passes. SWP is actually really good at this - he's quick and has excellent reflexes, so while he can't tackle he can stick a little leg out and aid in dispossessing the opponent. Then once Faurlin or someone has gained control of the ball SWP nips off into space to receive it, and we can consolidate possession.

superhoops,"Disclaimer: I'm not in a position to know what's happening behind the scenes. The following is based on rumor, hyperbole and years of inexperience.


The 2 biggest factors affecting QPR at the moment are *The 2 I's*....


**1. Instability**

Many managers, owners and huge volumes of players have passed through QPR in the past few years. This makes a poor basis for any football team, no matter what their level of skill and experience.

For several reasons Hughes does not know his best eleven; one reason is that the best eleven probably haven't appeared on the pitch together yet.


**2. Injuries**

I think at one point recently we had 10 players injured. Again, that is a recipe for disaster at any club. Our fortunes will not begin to change until this damage is repaired.


**Hughes**

Let me state the obvious: Hughes has changed too much too soon. I think he's been dogmatic about ripping out old players who were reliable enough to get a few goals in each season and could be trusted upon to scrape a successful, if unattractive, defensive performance when backs are against walls.

All of the football world knew QPR had a poor defense in need of strengthening and depth. Hughes left it until the dying days of the transfer window, after being f**ked by Swansea,  to acquire some defenders (aside from Nelsen & Fabio).

I see a football snobbery to Hughes' player selection, a desire to play top-level football before the team can even walk, using highly paid players from top-flight teams and old friends, rather than taking reliable talent, perhaps even from lower leagues. It shows a real lack of pragmatism that the likes of Warnock survive and thrive on each season.


**The Facebook crazies**

I am of the opinion they are casual supporters who don't often go to games and seldom watch a game on TV. Amongst other things they call for players who aren't even in the named 25 to start games(?). It's easy to type trash on a social media site - as many football players know - I just leave it at that. 
When I go to a game the supporters I speak to seem sane and level-headed. I've only once heard an older long-term supporter call for a manager to go (that was when an old workmate called into TalkSport after our 1-1 draw to MK Dons).


**Park**

He's obviously not captain material. He doesn't speak. Speaking is a basic requirement of a captain. Having said that, neither Warnock nor Hughes seem to give two hoots about the captains' armband, yet it usually seems to protect the wearer from being subbed - it wasn't until Barton was so bad, he became just too embarrassing, that he was taken off. At least Hughes has so far subbed Park once.


**Derry**

Won't score goals but is a captain of defense. We all know he was the practical captain during our promotion year. There are Facebook crazies who seriously believe Taarabt marshaled the team to success. I call that view retarded as I have no other explanation for it.
Derry has a very level head, very vocal and has a footballing brain. I suspect it is only Hughes' dogma that keeps Derry out of the line-up.

**Barton**

I don't care about his tweets, his personality or the music he listens to. I care that Barton was mostly sxxt last season. He single-handedly lost us at least 2 games by being pure sxxt. All our current midfielders are better than him. If he did anything slightly good in a game, many people watching TV would sing his praises. There's no reason on this earth to take him back into the fold during the January transfer window. I'm glad Beard has said there's no way back for him.",634,2012-10-08
superhoops,"A quick browse of the web's QPR forums reveals pretty widespread panic. Many of the debates focus around the following topics.

* Hughes should be fired. Various replacements suggested, Harry Redknapp the big name alternative.

* Park has been a disappointment, both as a captain and a player.

* We need Joey Barton back to add aggression to the midfield.

* The defensive personnel (Nelson excepted) are not good enough and should be overhauled in January.

I've known /r/superhoops to offer more considered responses so I wondered what you lot have to say about all this. Could it be said that, in any sense, we're moving in the right direction? What changes can be made that will see us picking up points? 

Personally, I think the answers to these debate topics are no, no, no and no:

* Hughes has an awful record so far but we need stability now, not more unrest.

* Park should accept as much responsibility as the rest of the squad, but should not be made a scapegoat. The captaincy issue is a red herring, as it has been for a few seasons at Loftus Road.

* We have 5 better centre midfielders than Barton. 

* We have some squad selection issues (Hill should not be playing at left back, SWP should not be starting, Derry's inclusion in the team would help with organisation, leadership and concentration) but the personnel is not the problem. January would be better spent selling players than buying. The key to improvement lies on the training ground, primarily in stopping the defensive errors.

superhoops,"Thought Diakite was fantastic yesterday. Still a bit too heavy and late at times with his tackles, but otherwise superb. Some of his successful sliding tackles were top-draw.

Mbia is not just skillful, he scares the crap out of the opposition. I saw him with the ball being approach by an Everton player 3mts away; Mbia faked a lunge forwards with a scarey face. The Evertonian flinched and Mbia switched to his left in space. Quality stuff.

Thought our defence looked much better, still an occasional minor panic, but overall much improved.

Lots of good performances apart from our 2 strikers.
I thought Zamora mostly had a stinker of a game. If he's going to have the task of holding up the ball he'll need to win it in the air more and successfully pass it to our players. 

What we lack is a striker. Cisse is off his game still, lost his mojo. Because these 2 aren't scoring we're struggling.

Everton went down to 10 men with 30 mins to go. We should have won the game; it was a great opportunity.

Looks like our goals are going to have to come from mid-field. Back to the tactics of the end of last season when Cisse was banned a lot.

Hughes still does requests. The crowd calling for Cisse meant he came on instead of Mackie, who I heard Hughes was warming up.
",234,2012-10-21
superhoops,"Overall, positive performance, disappointing result. Here's my player by player analysis:

Cesar - Solid, top top keeper, unfortunate for the OG. Some people complain he flaps or punches too much but that's just his style and he generally gets good distance on the ball. 7/10

Nelsen - Once again proving to be a great addition and just a shame he isn't 10 years younger, commanding and what he lacks in pace he makes up for in positional sense. Felt he could have done better with the header in the first half though, should have scored. 7/10

Mbia - I reckon once he settles in to the rhythm of the league he'll be an absolute weapon. Great composure, good on the ball, does like to go forwards alot (I realise he prefers to play as CDM) but was assured at the back, I'd like to see him do a bit better in the air too. 8/10

Bosingwa - Again, a reasonable performance, did well in keeping Baines and Pienaar reasonably quiet. Felt his crossing was poor this game though and communication with other defenders was an issue at times but that's a whole defense more than just a Bosingwa issue. 6/10

Traore - Hopefully he can get his fitness back because he makes such a difference than when we've had to put Hill at LB. His pace is such an asset and he links up so well with Taraabt down the left side. Arguably our best crosser of the ball too, just needs to work on positional play a bit more. 7/10

Park - Did a job this game without being spectacular, I think he does a lot of grunt work that people don't give him credit for and had some great sliding tackles but too many misplaced passes and spent too long on the ball a couple of times. 6/10

Granero - What a player this guy is, so assured on the ball and links up brilliantly with the rest of the midfield and the attack, his ability to turn with the ball in a tight area to get away from his man is incredible. Controlled the midfield and has a decent set piece on him, once settled he could be our best player this season and for me, joint man of the match 9/10

Diakite - Quiet first half, didn't really get involved much but changed it all around in the second. He has raw talent in abundance, the ability to glide past players is a beauty to watch just needs to lock down some consistency. Still he scares the bejeebus out of me everytime he goes in for a tackle, it's either a brilliant tackle or attempted murder. If he can keep that second half performance up he'll be a superstar. 7/10

Taarabt - Again, undoubted talent in this guy and was shown in the first half, everytime he gets the ball he is so unpredictable, long pass, short pass, trick, shot, you never know what he'll do. His link up play has improved by worlds and him and Traore had a fantastic understanding down the left side this game. Was fairly anonymous in the second half though, again, needs to get involved a bit more. 8/10

Zamora - A workhorse performance albeit a slightly disappointing one. Defensively he was absolutely woeful and at fault for the goal conceded. For me he didn't win enough in the air either. Everton looked to have 2 people on him at most times which made it difficult for him but he should be doing a bit better. Couple of poor decisions and some of his passing needs to be a bit crisper but I'd keep him in the team to try and bully Arsenal's defense next week. 6/10

Hoilett - Hasn't been given enough of a chance this year for me but proved his worth this game. He was just all energy, running forward, tracking back. Great ability to cut inside players and shoot and was only denied a couple more goals from some great saves from Howard, I like him in that front roll working off Zamora and if he can keep the same energy levels and work on his final product a bit will score a hatful this year.

superhoops,"Not sure what you chaps made of it, but here are my thoughts:

**+ points**

* Excellent passing play. Granero and Diakité both had superb games. Diakité man of the match for me.
* Excellent workrate off the ball. Again, Granero and Diakité worthy of special mention. It's not surprising that Diakité with his size and strength can both make and skip past tackles, but Granero really put in a shift today. He got the better of Anichebe several times. Huge plus for him.
* Mbia is looking *good*. Like, very, very good. 
* Park in the middle is a no-brainer. Why was he even out on the wing to begin with? 
* Hoilett-Zamora-Taarabt link-up is looking very, very good.
* To hell with individual mentions, everyone was bloody great today. I mean it: Bosingwa was awesome, Zamora did his job well even though he constantly had a lot of pressure on him, Taarabt awesome (good to see him play all 90 minutes), Nelsen solid (one duel with him and Anichebe was out for the count) ... it goes on.

**- points**

* Even when we play better, we fail to create and put away that crucial game-winning opportunity. 
* We still look shaky as hell from dead-ball situations. One shitty goal conceded, one off the crossbar and one heartattack moment in the second half where César bailed us out, all from corners and free-kicks. 


Finishing note: that penalty shout at the end ... was that as obvious a penalty as it looked? Because I was pretty close and it looked like an absolutely stone-wall penalty. Again, shitty decisions from the referee costing us points. Only surprise was that it wasn't Clattenburg.

Much to be proud of, but lacking the points still. ",292,2012-10-21

Some say It's when a team like the Arse have just lost a game that you don't want to play them, as they will be more focused and need to improve.

Personally, I think this is the best time. Their confidence must be low and we stuffed them at the Loft last season, whilt they only beat us 1-0 at their place with an RVP goal.

We're bottom of the league and everyone knows we shouldnt be there; there's great pressure on our manager for a win. All in all I can't see the Arse feeling too confident about playing us at this time.

However, that said, I think they are just he kind of team we could get up against, they like to pass the ball around too, don't have a real enforced to terrorise our defense and are not that special from set pieces, it could be just the game we need. Also, if we get an early goal the crowd will get on their back and could be the initiative we need.

superhoops,"Is there ever a good time to play Arsenal at the Emirates? They may have lost to Norwich and to Schalke but they are still Arsenal, and we still haven't won away since November 2011. When was the last time Arsenal lost three in a row? We should be grateful for any point here and focus on getting 6/6 against Reading and Soton. 

Having said that, we do have a chance. We are quite similar to Arsenal, actually: we prefer to play on the ground, we're not a predominantly physical side, and battles in the air are not our strong suit. Hopefully, against Arsenal, we'll avoid conceding more shitty goals from crosses and corners. We are not better than Arsenal in midfield; against Arteta and Cazorla there is no way that we're going to be in a position to dictate anything. Therefore, I can only really see us having a chance if we successfully man-mark Cazorla, crowd the midfield with any three of Park/Granero/Diakité/Faurlin, put pressure on them as soon as they approach our box as Norwich did and counterattack with Taarabt/Hoilett/Cissé. As Munkey said, an early goal and the fans will turn on them. ",195,2012-10-25
superhoops,"Arsenal are a good team with great players. It's tough for a bottom-half-of-the-table club to go to the Emirates and get anything.

It was a repeat of our Emirates score under Warnock last season, when RVP bagged the winner. This time the ball was scrapped in from an off-side position by Arteta from a meter out.


I didn't make it to the game and saw the 2nd half on a stream.

We were obviously outclassed for possession, as reflected in the stats. We had some possession but the likes of SWP seem unable to complete basic passing even when not under any pressure.

Our defense mostly held strong despite constant shots from Arsenal. Cesar made a few quality saves as usual, despite a reportedly shaky start to the game.


We seem to have several long-term issues:

* Ill discipline: we find it difficult to keep 10 players on the pitch.
* Constantly offside: Now even Hoillett is joining in the off-side fun.
* Good players demoted to the bench: Faurlin sat on the bench despite SWP being on the pitch.
* Dogmatic faith in SWP.
* No goal scorer: Johnson out, Helguson gone to Cardiff, DJ gone to Ipswich, Cisse lost his mojo.
* Lack of fluidity: Can this squad click and flow?

If we don't get a win by Southampton I can't see Hughes staying at QPR. The situation is becoming more and more bizarre; we haven't won a game of football in the PL for 6 months, we haven't won an away game for one year.

Hughes selected the squad, it's his. As much as I crave stability at QPR we need to start winning games or our club is in very serious trouble, with so many £multi-million players in the ranks; I don't want to see a repeat of 1996.

superhoops,"Starting to tire of this trend of dignified losses. When we lose, it's always a narrow defeat (except for Swansea). We're never outplayed, but we lose anyway, and always by the one goal. 

The scapegoats are obvious today: Mbia and the ref. Arteta's goal was blatantly offside. Furthermore, I haven't seen any replays yet, but it seemed that when Hoilett chipped the keeper, it was Zamora who was offside, not Hoilett. 

Mbia. What the *hell* was he thinking? I'm absolutely bloody sick of these stupid red cards. We had *so many* of them last season, so many cheap sending offs, from Diakité's incessant yellow cards to Barton's red-because-it's-Barton against Norwich to Taarabt's ridiculous sending off for toe-poking the ball 10 meters away to Cissé's unnecessary rash tackles that cost us points and contributed to our relegation struggles, something which I'd *very much* like to avoid this year.

And it's not that I really mind losing away against Arsenal. They are very, very good at home; that's not where we should be getting our points. But it's impossible not to be frustrated when we had the draw in our hands, then Mbia gets sent off like that and they get a goal that shouldn't have stood.

Something is wrong. I don't know what it is, whether it's players not interested, tactics not quite right, poor recruitment, I just don't know. We have now played a full season of away games without a win, that is unacceptable. We are over a quarter into the season and are without a win, that is unacceptable. 

Will a new manager change this? Again, I don't know. Yesterday appeared to our strongest team with current injuries and suspensions. We played some great football in the first half, much like against Spurs yet we concede another stupid goal from switching off and we can't put the ball in the net. Taarabt has been arguably our best player in recent weeks but should have almost scored a hattrick, confidence is definitely an issue at our club and I fear we're building too big a losing mentality.

As for change of managers, as I said before, I'm not 100% convinced we should, however the more we lose, the bigger the above mentioned losing mentality grows. Who else would we get?? Harry Redknapp? I'm not totally convinced by him, who else is available that could do a job? Rafa Benitez maybe? Honestly, who would take on this job now?

Personally, if we lose against Southampton then we're in dire, dire straits and that's when we start looking for change, as for what/who and if it will make a difference? Well....things can't get much worth.",290,2012-11-10
superhoops,"19 away games without a win and no home wins this season. We have excelled the worst ever top-flight table performance in our history ('68/'69).

We're in a situation where, even if we beat Southampton at home next weekend, we may still be bottom of the table.

We're unable to score from relatively straight-forward chances and our back four are still making mistakes.

To get rid of 5 strikers (including our top goal-scorer) and replace them with Andy Johnson seems to have been naive at best. Our back-four was largely a last-minute panic. To repair those issues will require buying more players, which can't happen until January and Fernandes has said there won't be much money available.

* How long can we leave it?

Again, I don't know what the issue is with this team at the moment, but will changing the manager help us score those chances? or help us stay alert at the back? Unfortunately there is no top-class manager lined up who could take over straight away. I really, really don't want Redknapp. His entire managerial style is based on buying players; tactically, he is not better than Hughes. 

Who then? The last thing we need is more uncertainty, and unless there's a proven manager ready to swoop in, I don't think uprooting the entire backroom staff and bringing in more new faces to a team that looks like they met each other yesterday is a good idea. 

It's tough, but I still believe that all we need is that first win. We put one of those chances away, get our three points and we'll be on our way. ",218,2012-11-10

Southampton hammered Villa 4-1 and since then they've drawn two games and lost four. In these six games they've conceded 14 goals, so 2.3 per game; and in their last three games away from home they've conceded 9. 

On top of this, Southampton should be easier for us to deal with than Reading, since Reading play down the flanks, while Southampton's style is quite similar to ours: they like having possession and passing the ball around. Our total inability to defend crosses should not be as important against the Saints as against Reading or Stoke. 

If our strikers weren't misfiring so much, I might even be confident. As it were, I am nowhere near confident. Nevertheless, my incurable optimism strikes again as I play Taarabt in my Fantasy team instead of Crouch.

* We can't defend set pieces (as an aside it was so annoying to hear Trevor Francis on commentary banging on and on about Fergie's tactical genius in making his subs. We conceded two soft corners to players already on the pitch. Fool).

* Mackie is fantastic against the big clubs, particularly away from home. He changed the game at the Emirates and was dangerous yesterday.

* Cisse needs guidance. He looks lost. Good cross for the disallowed goal though.

* Taarabt is hugely important to us. I'm worried Harry will use him as an impact sub, having let him go from Spurs, but should have noted yesterday how he's changed as a player since those days.

superhoops,"Despite losing 3-1 I feel broadly positive about what I saw.

The line-up was a pleasant surprise, more like a Warnock squad with a few extras. I have always thought this is what Hughes should have been aiming for from the outset of his tenure. The strategy should have been evolution, not revolution. We have a core of players who have been through the mill together and know how to play as a team. Adding talent here and there with the likes of Cesar, Nelsen and M'bia ensures we are also moving on.

Derry, Nelsen and Hill mastered defense in the first half, containing RVP and Rooney, like parents guiding kiddies off the pitch. Great to see. They successfully intimidated Ashley Young, which I am sure Fergie noticed - hence the substitution.

Kieron Dyer was great again, just as he was in the Spurs game. The man has something quietly special, he is 'Mr Assist', I just wish he was available to play more often.

Mackie should be playing up front on a regular basis. His pace scares opposition defenders. If Harry cam also get him to achieve a little more control we will have gone part way to solving our striker problem.

When Traore came off for Ferdinand the gates of Hell opened, goals rained down upon us. Was it all Ferdinand's fault or are we just terrible at defending set-pieces?

If we can sort out defending set-pieces and improve our shots on goal we will be fine.

One the other hand, there are a few elements in play that should make us cautious. Remember how we made Carlton Cole look like a world-beater? Benteke could have the same effect. Villa's away record is poor, but our home performances and results have lurched from woeful to abysmal, and we still can't score.

Granero had a pretty poor game against Sunderland -- he's looked a bit off for a few weeks now, hasn't he? -- so I would quite like Faurlin to have a chance to start. 

I also hope 'Arry gives Fabio a chance to play. Mbia did his job well at RB against United but I was surprised that Bosingwa was preferred to Fabio against Sunderland. Imo, Bosingwa is one of those players who looks like he really doesn't give a toss about where the club ends up. Fabio has a point to prove to SAF.

Then we ran out of steam, without the subs to get fresh legs. Park and Derry weren't nearly as effective as a central midfield pairing.

Chances of staying in the league are slipping away, though not yet gone completely.

QPR have the worst away record in English football, not having won away since Stoke in November 2011, so don't count you chickens.

Despite their lose against Newcastle, Wigan played very well, keeping possession for large parts of the game, forcing Newcastle into long-range shots.

Mbia -- what a signing. In the first half, when Berbatov played an offensive midfield role, Mbia man-marked him and effectively removed him from the game. In the second half, when Berbatov went to play in his native striker role, Mbia bossed Sidwell and Duff around so much it was almost embarrassing for them. He was dominant that game. Nothing went by him. He won practically every ball. Top marks.

And then Adel Taarabt -- what can you say? When he plays like that he is untouchable. His first goal was lucky, but his overall performance deserves all the plaudits he's going to get. I hope to ~~God~~ Allah he stays and doesn't go to United or Arsenal.

But to step down from the wave of euphoria, even though we played quality football, Fulham put in the worst performance a guy I overheard on the Tube had ever seen in his life. It was was definitely the worst game I've seen an away team play at Loftus Road since we were promoted. Before they got their deflected goal, they hadn't even had a shot on target all game.

Pleased with the team effort today they played well and put effort in something I think Harry has drummed into them never let the ball go if you do you chase and get it back not put your hands up and admit defeat like we have seen a few times this season

For much of the game our players chased everything. When M'bia fell over and lost possession he chased the ball until he got it back. SWP did the same.

It's the most confident we've looked all season and what a difference it made, that has come from being undefeated since Harry joined.

We still need to keep closing down opposition players, that's what cost us the Fulham goal.

Let's aim to stay unbeaten. Confidence is the key to everything now.",108,2012-12-15

It would help us protect leads, which is something we are currently spectacularly bad at, because when the run of play is against us we invite pressure by never having an outlet up front.

Our best defenders are not ball-players, they are old-style ball-winners. They will not and should not be looking to launch attacks. They are there to defend. When under pressure, they should simply clear it. If we had someone upfield who can turn hopeful punts and clearances into possession, it enables our defence to focus on defending.",167,2012-12-18

The Championship is full of shit-hot teams built from the ground up to thrive in that environment and push for the big time. QPR on the other hand is full of ageing, self-important mercenaries who cannot seem to muster any enthusiasm to play against the likes of Liverpool - so imagine how riveted they will be at the prospect of an away trip to Huddersfield or Brighton.

Unfortunately Fernandes' naivete has cost QPR dear and his ""death or glory"" recruitment policy has backfired massively. Wage demands will not be met, players will be discarded en-masse and the Rangers will struggle to remain in the Championship with a bare-bones side.

The upshot of this is that it'll most likely be youth players that'll come to the fore, and if they do manage to gel into a coherent unit we will have a strong platform to rebuild the team and get back into the Prem. But that's a big 'if'.",189,2012-12-31

Those who watched us in the championship will remember that teams used to foul him early on in games so that he'd get his sulk on. He was fouled constantly last night but kept going until his 90th minute substitution.

Secondly, there was a revealing display of team spirit and professionalism from an unused substitute. Ali Faurlin warmed up almost constantly last night, and was the only player who did so without tracksuit bottoms on, ready to be called into action at any point. He never got the call, but at the final whistle ran onto the pitch and bowed down to Sean Derry, giving him the 'worshipping' gesture for his outstanding performance.

superhoops,"First of all I want to acknowledge the tremendous support Rs fans showed. We performed almost the entire retinue of Hoops songs and demonstrated to the opposition what support is. Even when you're at rock bottom you have to cheer on the lads and we did that for most of the game.

Before the game I managed to get inside a Chelsea pub, they had a choice of individual cotton hand towels in a wicker basket or luxurious disposable three-ply hand tissues in the gents. We don't get that in the Springbok, where you dry your hands on your trousers.

3,000 had to wait outside the ground to get through 4 turnstiles. An experience that wound us all up and likely contributed to the energy of our support, along with the extortionate £60 entry fee.

We started the game quite strongly and didn't collapse back into our own half as I expected. Mackie had a chance at goal but seemed to lack the confidence to finish and their keeper made no mistake. Within 4 mins one of their players should have been sent off for a 2-footed studs-up foul on M’bia, but got away with it.

Most of the play was Chelsea taking shots on our goal from distance as our defensive players crowded them out of the box. SWP was having a bit of a poor game in the first half and passes out to him on the left wing were mostly too far forward for even his pace. SWP had come on for an injured Hoilett early on, so wasn't a starting 11 choice for Harry.

By half time I was feeling good about our performance; we'd shown character and a great work rate, taking all they could throw at us.

At half time the same arrogant twat with the mic that insulted us the last time we were at the Bridge did it again. This time he said that some old Chelsea player he'd just walked around the pitch - to prompted applause - had won more medals than QPR has in our entire history. Chelsea have amazingly poor tact and, as we all know, terrible PR. I've never heard any club employee speak to visitors like they do. They really can’t help themselves can they?

The second half saw a few very close calls, where Chelsea broke deeper into our penalty box and Lampard had a goal disallowed for off-side, then the tables changed and SWP did something he’s never done for QPR before and scored a goal in a league game.

Naturally the Rs fans went nuts. Grabbing random strangers and hugging them is only to be seen at a football game and at an ecstasy-induced rave party. At the Bridge yesterday, SWP provided the class A.

From then on I resumed the standing foetal position I’d not employed since the Man City game at the end of last season. That situation is not something you can understand unless you’ve experienced it.

Then, it happened. We won!

superhoops,"Let me try to come up with enough points from the games that are left:

**Norwich**: They have only got 1 win in there last 6 games which was an unconvincing home win against Wigan, they seem like they are about to start sliding down the ladder.

**Southampton**: Definitely not beyond us to obtain a sneaky away win against the other Relegation contenders.

**Sunderland**: Managed a nill all draw at the Stadium of Light last time against Sunderland and in strange turn of events QPR actually had more possession and more shots, should go one better against them at Home and create some momentum with two wins in a row.

**Aston Villa**: Could go either way here but I am going to back the R's to win this one and to notch up there third win on the trot, Aston Villa have been very unconvincing all season and I am still sticking by the prediction I made at the beginning of the season that they will get relegated.

**Fulham**: I know it's an away game but for some reason we seem to really lift against West London rivals, it will be a tough game but we will have all the momentum and chants of Harry's greatness will be heard all across West London.

**Wigan**: Wigan have been very poor all season only getting one draw and one win in there last 8 league matches and are a serious relegation chance at this stage. This may seem ridiculous but I believe this could be QPR's fifth win in a row, a run of wins that has not been seen by the R's since the League One days of 2003.

**Reading**: After a couple of losses (or draws) we will get revenge for the defeat earlier in the season away from home. Reading are poor and will finish bottom.

The rest of the points would have to be made up with draws, maybe Newcastle, Stoke, West Ham and Aresnal. I am not saying this is going to happen, it is a long long shot I am merely calling my prediction and it is every chance that I will be way off but hey, a man can dream can't he?

""They have been so understanding with my situation.
They understand that when I play I am playing on glass knees and glass ankles. It is a bit of a struggle.
They know I am at the end but they also know the predicament they are in. It is a major predicament.
QPR would like me to keep playing but we have to sit down and talk. If we can get five straight wins, that'd be perfect.

superhoops,"I'm still 50-50 on Redknapp. I definitely think he's the only man for the job at the moment but don't see him as a long term option. I think he generally tells things how they are, usually very open. Many have described him as a premier league Warnock and I'm inclined to agree, candid yet honest. Probably won't hang around if we get relegated either.

Obviously a lot of what he says panders to the fans but it's definitely a step up from Mark ""Never seemed that bothered"" Hughes. With the predicament we're currently in the fans need to hear this kind of thing to keep them behind the team. Not sure I fancy our chances tomorrow but I haven't really fancied us in any games so who knows. 

I think our main problem now is that none of the players we really need would likely come to the club for the right reasons. Players that we need right now are ones that can cut it in the premier league and have the desire to perform. The only real incentives to come to QPR at the moment are likely for the money, as a step up from their current or to prove themselves and try and get picked up by a bigger team if we go down. That leaves us with players that probably aren't good enough or more mercenaries. We just have to hope that anyone that does come in falls under the category of trying to prove themselves.",250,2013-01-11

superhoops,"Fabio was my MOTM today. Every single touch he made was a cut above the nearest spurs player and advanced our efforts massively. A close second is Derry, who was always underneath the lofted ball in midfield and was an absolute rock in the middle of the pitch. The only letdown was Park, who was the only player in a hooped shirt who looked unwilling to get stuck in and fight for the ball, preferring to stay in space and pretend he was guiding preceedings from afar. I would've replaced him with Faurlin or Granero at half time.

overall though, solid stuff and a great point to take.
",108,2013-01-12

Another player who deserves mention for their performance today surely must be Wright-Philips. Even though he was unable to finish his chances he looked dangerous on the wing. 

We have many games ahead where we will need wins.  I don't think today's fixture needed a win and really a draw is a fantastic result. ",88,2013-01-12
superhoops,"After success against Chelsea, it seems Redknapp has found his formula of choice for playing against teams that are better than us. As with the Chelsea game, we played an extremely tight defence and midfield, pressuring the ball early and stopping the opponents before they could gain any momentum. Taarabt played up front on his own, holding the ball up and waiting to start a counter-attack.

A clean sheet is an achievement we shouldn't play down when we've only managed it three times so far (twice against Chelsea!). Neither is claiming a point vs. the league #3. César made some immense saves to help us get there, but the defence and midfield deserve recognition for their hard work. Derry was evidently the spiritual leader as others around him played a physical and pragmatic game. Nelsen and Hill have become a solid pair. Adebayor and Defoe are exactly the kind of players we've struggled to contain this season. That we kept them out is a positive sign for sure.

As far as the fullbacks go, I'm glad to see Onuoha given chances and making good; he seemed very out of favour only a few months ago. Fabio was one of our better players today. In the beginning of the season I was worried every time he went on one of his sallies forth into offensive positions (Norwich, anyone?), but today he looked in control, and very dangerous. Rafael seems to have cemented his place at United, so if we stay up we might get a chance to sign him. We should spring at the chance.

Unfortunately the other player we got from United was the exception today. Perhaps Park's age is catching up with him, but he seems reluctant to get stuck into challenges: whenever there's a 50/50 for the ball in midfield, it always seems to end up going the opposition's way.

Pleased as I am with the overall performance, I have to say that I still left Loftus Road frustrated. Unfortunately we're at that stage in our season where we need to be claiming points even from unlikely places;  draws are no good when we need to climb quickly. If Tottenham had come out and absolutely run us over, then fair enough -- they're a superb team when they get into their stride. But today, we shut them down, and we kept them out. And with the three golden chances that fell to SWP you'd have expected at least one of them to end up in the net. But none did, and it feels more like two points lost than one point gained.",434,2013-01-12

superhoops,"Honestly, we really needed a win here.  I'm disappointed we only got a point.  I'm also disappointed the team fell off the wheels after about 30 minutes.  Unable to generate any sort of offense, with the silver lining being Remy's goal.

Ji-Sung Park seemed to get pushed off the ball much too regularly, probably due to his small size.  Mbia once again seemed to lack quality, a player I often criticize due to misplaced passes.  We seem to have a lot of trouble holding the ball up midfield, hopefully M'Vila can help us out in that area.

Overall, not really pleased with the single point here, as I said up above, we *really* needed this win.",116,2013-01-19
superhoops,"I would've taken the point before kick-off, but the way we scored so early on before becoming the inferior side as the game went on is concerning. What is also concerning is Reading's freakish ability to pick up wins they have no right to, as they have recently. Combined with the dramatic slide of Villa and Newcastle it makes it difficult to know which 3 sides we're actually trying to overhaul in the points tally.

However, if the bit in bold in Doeboy's post is true it's definitely a reason to be optimistic. Harry's R's are unrecognisable from Hughes'.",99,2013-01-19
superhoops,"What a tease.  Seeing the live table on bbc when we were 1 up was such a good feeling.  No longer in last, and only 2 points away from being out of the bottom three.  It wasn't a lose, but damn would have been a great win. ",47,2013-01-19
superhoops,"I'm pleased with Remy's goal, but I feel that we nearly gifted West Ham the match in the second half. We did a great job retaining possession in the first half, but I feel that we couldn't turn over the ball fast enough in the second half. Mbia... Jesus could he complete a pass?

Beyond QPR, it looks like Villa and Newcastle are now in a race to the bottom, and this should hopefully help in our quest to stay afloat. It'll be interesting to watch developments at Southampton as well, as I'm not sure if Pochettino can conserve the momentum from Adkins recent run of good form as well as connect with the players.

iViva the Redknapp Revolucion!",119,2013-01-19
superhoops,"Pleased with the point, considering we got mullered in the second half. The first half play between Taarabt and Remy looks like it's going to be a great partnership. Yet again Cesar kept us in the game more than once, SWP had another great game. Got a bit of a rest before City, which if we play as we have been, we might be able to nick a point from. Shame Reading and Villa (as of now) won, but we'll just have to do it ourselves. Onwards and upwards! ",89,2013-01-19
superhoops,"Redknapp sure he'll keep QPR up - ""We're gonna do it!""",11,2013-01-19
superhoops,"Despite a strong initial 15 mins and a goal from QPR, West Ham were too strong for us to hang on to the lead.

So much pressure on our goal and our inability to keep possession had to eventually bear fruit for West Ham. They had previously been beset by injury, unfortunately for QPR almost all Hammers' players were available for selection.

Positives:

* QPR are unbeaten in 2013.

* Remi scored.

* Another fine defensive display from QPR.

* Wright-Philips looks more confident with each game.

* We're only 5 points away from escaping relegation.

* This year we've been gaining points at an average of 2 per game.

It really would have made things a lot easier if we'd got a win today. We have 15 points and must get around 37-38 points, in total, to stay up. With 15 games left, we need an average of 1.53333 points per game.

**If we had been playing all season as we have been this year, we would finish the season with 76 points and 3rd position in the league.** We are now achieving the top-6 performance Harry said we need to survive.

Aside from the Man U game, I see lots of opportunities for wins in March, with perhaps a win or 2 if we are fortunate in February. 7 wins should see us safe.",226,2013-01-19

superhoops,"Congratulations MK Dons. You deserved the win.


I was at the game with a Lazio fan. He remarked that £2.50 a goal was good value. It's just a shame it came from Sunday-league-level footie. And *""Are they [QPR] always this shit?""* A good question.


Rangers fans were pretty much silent the entire game, aside from some booing as the game progressed. MK Dons fans sung for most of the match. The Dons took their chances, of which there were about 4. But that's all they needed for 3 goals, plus an early gift from Traoré.


There are rumours we played a back four. I remember seeing Tal Ben Haim defending our goal, beyond that  Ferdinand maintained perfectly white sparkly shorts for the 90+ mins.


I appreciate that we should try not to single-out individuals, but.... Ferdinand and Park plumbed new depths. Ferdinand didn't want to be on the pitch and was embarrassingly bad. Park was basically booed to the point Harry took pity on him and, considering the potential threat to shirt sales, replaced him with the still-un-fit Bobby Zamora; who did his usual thing of moving around in the opposition half whilst looking back at our goal and generally bumping into opposition players whilst fumbling the ball at his feet (sorry, those who know me are aware I'm not a Zamora fan).


**Player performance:**


**Granero:** Scrappy, very poor quality play. In the second half he started trying to win the game on his own. Schoolboy football. A massive disappointment.

**Faurlin:** Awful possession. Very poor pass completion. Terrible positional play. I hate to say it, but he seems to be getting worse with each game. A shadow of his former self.

**Green:** Seemed to be half asleep. Spent a lot of time complaining at the defence and referee, with some justification. He didn't seem bothered with the game.

**Park**: At times people stared at him, wondering what he was actually doing. Scraping for the ball and throwing himself at opposition players, whilst barely staying on his feet. I am not sure he completed more than half a dozen passes. Being taken off was a show of mercy on Harry's part.

**Mackie:** 100% effort, terrible finishing. He had several chances to knock it in the net, that verged on open goals, but bottled it. We all love Mackie, but he often lacks the finish of a PL player. Today it showed.

**De Silva:** Spent too much time in the opposition box and little time defending the QPR goal. Was easily caught out by simple Don's long-balls over his head. Seemed to be trying, which showed with the goal. Showed a lack of respect for the opposition, which cost us.

**Ben Haim:** Was a member of the Bermuda triangle back 4. In the 2nd half I was sitting in-line with the defence. He was one of the few that played in that area. Wasn't a good enough performance for a PL game, we'll see how he gets on.

**Zamora:** Was suprised to see him warming up at half-time. Did his general Zamora thing for the final 20 mins. Assisted the Bothroyd goal. Seemed more up for it than most of our players.

**Traoré:** Scored an own goal. Actually looked very good for most of the game, committed to the game and kept going past MKD players on the wing. Impressed my Lazio pal. 

**DJ Campbell:** Often looked threatening. His disallowed goal was a goal, he wasn't off-side. Should have been more coordinated with his team mates. Would likely do better with more playing opportunities. Was often crowded out by 9 men in the box.

**Bothroyd:** A big tall guy, should have scored a few from set pieces. He wandered around up front a lot, but failed to impress and took a few poor shots at goal. Otherwise rather anonymous.


**Ferdinand:** The worst player on the pitch. As the game progressed he began scaring both the crowd and Green by looking likely to score own goals. Was half asleep and disinterested. It's important we get another CB in the window.

 

We played our second-string non-first-eleven players today. Some of them are on very serious money. There's no excuses, they should have easily beaten a league 1 side.


If we stay in the Premier league all will be forgotten. As it is that was an awful experience for QPR fans, will have done player morale no good and may have further harmed our chances of signing new players.



What are/were your thoughts?

----------------------
PS: The £15 ticket price was a hint that Harry wasn't particularly looking to win the game but to see who of those players was up for the fight, the rest he will look to cast aside. In my view Mackie, Traoré (despite his own-goal), Ben Haim and possibly Fabio were OK; the rest can be got rid of, if buyers can be found.",813,2013-01-26

Historically, 10-11 wins have been enough to ensure Premier League survival, so it is likely that QPR will have to win three in five from here on in. A difficult test for a side that currently finds them self bottom of the table.

In total, ten players were loaned from the club. In particular, long-standing QPR player Alejandro Faurlin was loaned to Italian side Palermo. Faurlin was signed for £4M in the 2009/2010 season and enjoyed regular first team football while in the Championship. Redknapp has said that the Argentinian is still in his plans for the future so it looks as if the loan move was simple an attempt to decrease the wage bill. Djibil Cisse, only brought in last season, also found himself on loan, to Qatar side Al-Gharafa. Enjoying 6 goals in 7 apps last season, Cisse's effectiveness seems to have diminished this year and his determination upfront has come under question. Other players loaned out include Rob Hulse and Anton Ferdinand.

On the way in, QPR made two record signings in what Tony Fernandes and Harry Redknapp believe could be essential to another season in England's top flight league. Loic Remy, 25, comes in from French club Marseille, for a staggering €10.5M. Scoring 27 goals in 60 apps in his first two season at Marseille, it is hoped that his presence up front will be exactly what QPR needs.

Following several racist attacks in Russian, Samba was more than eager to return to English football. In addition to Samba, Tal Ben Haim and Suk-Young Youn have joined the squad in an effort to strengthen the back four. An injection in the midfield comes in the form of Tottenham players, Jermaine Jenas and youngster Andros Townsend. Both were last day signings, it is hoped they can bring the quality and creativity that QPR needs to ensure survival.

superhoops,"QPR Starting XI: Cesar; Fabio, Samba, Hill, Traore, SWP, Derry, Mbia, Townsend, Taarabt, Mackie. 

QPR Subs: Green; Park, Granero, Jenas, Ben Haim, Zamora, Bothroyd. 

Loic Remy and Nedum Onuoha both ruled out due to injury. ",35,2013-02-02
superhoops,"First half was poor -- so it goes, that's okay. But in the second half we were in complete control of the game for 30-35 minutes in which time Norwich must have had at most 3-4 sustained attacks. We had crosses, corners and free kicks en masse from dangerous positions and we were able to move the ball around at will -- we had about as much offensive pressure as we could have asked for. And yet we do not score.

What does it take for us to score, exactly? A penalty? Ah, nope. Not even that.

The only thing you can blame it on is Rémy's absence, but really, it's not much of an excuse. Mackie and Zamora should have got it done between them. It says a lot when the best chance of that entire spell of dominance came from a shot outside the box.

And yet we didn't play poorly. We just didn't score. 

I don't know what the opposite of clutch is, but we are that.",170,2013-02-02
superhoops,"Well, that just wasn't good enough was it?

For our only clear chance to be a penalty against a rather poor Norwich outfit is massively underwhelming. 

If there was one game we needed Remy for it was this one. Massive loss for us, lets just pray its nothing long-term and he can stay fit for a while...

For me the biggest positive was Andros Townsend - he was very impressive, looked lively throughout and wasn't afraid to shoot, drawing a smart save from Bunn in the second half. Julio Cesar was pulling the kind of heroics we expect from him now, and Samba looked as solid as we'd expect, if a little unfit.

I'll stop rambling now and let you guys take over...",123,2013-02-02
superhoops,"Such a massive game for us. The last time we had games that we called ""must-wins"" were the ones at home to Soton and Reading -- losing them ended up getting Hughes sacked. 

This game is even more important. It's not the manager who's on the line this time, but survival. We simply have to start picking up wins, and there is no time to do that's better than now.

After initially saying that he was not expecting to play this week, there are now reports that Samba is now set to make his debut. 

Hughton was at Loftus Road when we drew with City. He has since praised the structure of our play and emphasised that hard work will be central to beating us. Their new signing Luciano Becchio is in the squad. Norwich now sit seven points above the relegation places; from their last three games they've managed two draws. In other words, they see this as a great game to pick up points to safeguard them from the drop-zone.

Which, all in all, means that it's gonna be a tough one. Hope the crowd turns up to cheer on the team. We're going to need all the fight we can muster. Come on you R's.

Samba looked really good defensively and we also generated some good chances up front.  The Tottenham duo managed some great shots and crosses.  Things look positive in my opinion and we cannot lose hope now.  Tottenham and Man City were games we should have lost and we managed draws.  That's 2 points and another point for the draw today so maybe we can look at it as a win. As always, look toward the future and don't dwell on the past. We still have a fighters chance to stay up and I think Redknapp can get us there. ",121,2013-02-02
superhoops,"It's the first game this year where we'll have to venture away from our new 'everyone behind the ball' defensive tactics. A lot hinges on Taarabt today, and Remy too. We have to figure out a way to score.",39,2013-02-02
superhoops,"Our defence had to deal with few real threats. Samba was great, Clint was mostly good, made a couple of small mistakes, but team mates were able to deal with it. César was his usual excellent self. Townsend was our man of the match with a stellar performance, he's very talented and drove the ball forward at every opportunity.

The problem with our attack has been the same all year, the rest of the team doesn't move forward when a QPR player has the ball. The other players are stopping still, ready to run back into defence. There was some improvement in the 2nd half, but not enough. Finishing was poor, Taarabt's penalty was very tame. Heider would have scored it.

Mackie kept creating opportunities out of absolutely nothing, but has lost his finish.

I don't see Remy as the saviour. He'll score a few goals for us but his perfect scenario is what we saw at Wet Spam - up front, with Zamora in support, with 1 or 2 defenders to beat and the goalie to shoot past. Besides, by the sounds of it, he's sort out for a while now.

Harry's done an amazing job with our defence. If table position was decided on goals conceded we;d be 7th in the table, now we need to out attack.",220,2013-02-02

Our defence is now light-years ahead of the one that went to Old Trafford and the likes of Derry and Hill eat Cole and Van Persie for breakfast. With this year's results and the addition of Cézar and Samba we can be confident of a very strong back-line, resisting most of what Man U can throw at us.

Yesterday's game showed exactly where our weaknesses are: up front.

Harry and the team have a week to prepare for Saturday, to work out a plan to get QPR scoring goals.

Townsend was a revelation yesterday, he can only get better. With Man U playing a more open game than Norwich, I see goals coming from our mid-field. QPR players always seem to up their game against the top clubs.

The Norwich match should be seen as a transition game, we must now face connecting up the 3 sections of the team: from defence to mid-field, to attack. Turning QPR into a complete football team for the first time this season.

Expect to see Fergie red-faced and fuming after the game, claiming all sorts of injustices and a summer transfer request for Cézar.

superhoops,"Impromptu, probably shitty translation:

I have contacted supporter groups of all 20 Premier League clubs and asked them to nominate a player from their own team. The primary criteria has not been their ability, but what the player's relationship with the supporters, media, referees, teammates and opponents is like. In addition to the thoughts of the supporter groups, I have asked Nettavisen's sports journalists for their opinion, and thus I have both the supporters' and the media's viewpoint on each candidate.

The supporters' judgement: Mackie is the player who gives all for the club. Limited technical ability is compensated for with an attitude on the pitch that players with much higher wages can be envious of. A crowd favourite! He was a strong contributor to QPR's promotion from the Championship, and no self-respecting supporter will ever forget the equalising goal in the away game against Derby County, four minutes over-time; nor the winning goal against Liverpool, three minutes over time.

The journalists' judgement: not a player most people know much about, except that he scores a goal now and then. I was helped a little by TV2's talented commentator Jørgen Klem here, who told me that Mackie is a player who gives all and never complains, who loves playing football, never pronounces himself negatively about anyone and has an attitude the fans love. ""Need more of them. They are few"" (?) said Jørgen. Sounds like a good candidate for this competition, if you ask me.

THANK YOU 
A communication from the club to fans often involves statements on club affairs or a marketing campaign to encourage you to buy the latest top or purchase tickets for the next game. It shouldn’t always be like that. 

 As a Board, sometimes we need to contact you just to say how grateful we are for your support. No sales tactic. No marketing ploy. Just thank you. 

 In January, the most difficult month of the year when it comes to finances, we hosted three games at Loftus Road in the space of eight days. And yet, your support for those fixtures against MK Dons, Manchester City and Norwich City was just incredible. 

The noise you generated when we battled to a deserved draw against the champions of England was amazing. 

 We, as a Board, are tremendously appreciative of the effort and cost involved for you to attend those matches in such numbers. 

 We are hugely grateful, and that level of support – particularly the vociferous backing you gave Tony Fernandes – merely reaffirmed his belief that becoming involved with QPR was a fantastic decision. 

 As I’m sure you noticed, there has been a lot of media coverage afforded to our activity in the January transfer window. Our intention is clear. To stay in the Premier League. 

 And we believe the acquisitions of Tal Ben Haim, Loic Remy, Yun Suk-Young , Chris Samba, Andros Townsend and Jermaine Jenas have improved our chances of doing that. 

 Tony and the rest of the Board are completely committed to the future of this club. Despite what you may have read in the papers, the club is not facing financial ruin if we suffer relegation this season. All possible outcomes have been considered 

 But right now our focus is on staying in the best league in the world. We believe we can achieve it. And it’s what you deserve. 

So, on behalf of the Board, thank you.

He's matured through this season. He seemed to keep attacking under Hughes and forgot about his defensive responsibilities at times and on occasions came across a bit Keytstone Cops. That has changed under Redknapp and he has settled into a proper defensive role, while providing an attacking threat on occasions and a mid-field role, connecting up the play on the wing. He shows flashes of skill and an increasing self-confidence. I'd say he's like a short David Luiz, but out on the wing.

I think his brother still shows an edge on him, though that could be largely down to who he has playing around him and his teams comfortable position in the league table.",169,2013-03-17
superhoops,"A few months ago, I made a post saying that in our last 18 fixtures we needed 9 wins.  Well, we have played 10 of those 18 and only come away with 2 wins.  We are drastically off target and while survival is not entirely impossible, we need 6 out of 8 just to match our win total from last season.  More importantly, we need 7 out of 8 to have any chance of survival.

Here are our next 8 fixtures.

Fulham

Wigan

**Everton**

Stoke

Reading

**Arsenal**

Newcastle

**Liverpool**

So... our toughest games here are highlighted in bold.  We need to win all of our easy games and then take one away (two preferably) from the bold teams.  Just thought some people could use this information.

Realistically, this is going to be exceptionally difficult; the important thing is to not lose hope. ",142,2013-03-18

My QPR career was over when they decided to listen to the footballing sage, Mark of Hughes.


I'm loving life in France. Loving Marseille. They love me. All I want to do is gave everything for this football club. They backed me when nobody else did, for that I will be eternally grateful. This club is now in my blood, its impossible to get it out. #ForzaOM


For the record, QPR was over 4 me way before the Man City incident. Those stories are for another time. I wish QPR all the best 4 the future. I really hope they stay up. I have all season. Stay up/go down. Harry stays/goes. I don't want to be part of it. Marseille is my home now. It's not up to QPR if I stay. **Agreement already in place for me to stay here**. Can't see QPR wanting me on the wage bill in the Champ.


It was a move for me that just never worked out. Sometimes that happens. I gave my all in that shirt as I always do. I made mistakes. But I never gave less then my all, regardless of internal politics. I played a part in keeping them up last year. This year, I was banished from the 1st day of pre-season training.

superhoops,"Don't like to be the first to weigh in, but I suppose as a fan that has thrown several hundred quid at the team this season I'm entitled to. To my untrained eye, here's a Tuesday night brigade that I'm not sure will bounce us back immediately, but hopefully wouldn't sink us like Wolves:

* If he stays, Green in goal.
* Keep Bothroyd and Mackie but we will need to fish out a striker with pace and a better touch than the latter  - possibly on loan. Maybe keep Johnson and SWP in the rotation too.
* If Taarabt wants to stay, let him. He's young, on the books until 2015, and should be given a chance to earn his crowd chant back. Not sure what the accountants will say though - if they need to sell him I can see them doing it early in the window.
* Diakité, Faurlin and Jenas in the middle. Would like Hoillett to stay. Possibly Ephraim too.
* Traoré, Hill, Onuoha, and Yun Suk-Young at the back. Derry as supplementary, along with Luke Young if he returns from the grave.

But this lot...I'd like to think reducing the transfer fee to offset some of the higher wages we'd be passing along could be a strategy, but I doubt that would suit the agents taking a percentage cut?

* Cesar - Surely need him off the wage books.
* Remy - Au revoir.
* Bosingwa - Would love to find a buyer but if not he'll burn £3.5 million a year. Awful piece of business, but at least he'll pay a lot of income tax.
* Granero - Higher hopes for finding a buyer for him. Hasn't impressed but apparently QPR's best percentage passer this season (up until a few weeks ago).
* Park - his 'Asian Beckham' brand will hopefully take him elsewhere, even if it means taking a pay cut.
* Samba - Not sure who will match his wages - hasn't actually impressed much since arriving. Not sure he will want to return to Russia.
* Cissé - Has bagged 5 goals in 6 games in the UAE - fingers crossed we can ditch him on a permanent deal somewhere similar.
* Barton - Sell him to Marseille, assuming they want to keep him. Can imagine he'd make a modest salary hit to stay there too.
* Zamora - Surely no chance of selling him with his dodgy hip. He'll be a striker from the bench for a season before retiring. Expensive.
* Mbia - Would probably be valuable in the Championship but I think we'd find a buyer quite easily, despite some of his poor decisions. Seems to love to get stuck in.
* Ferdinand - Still haven't forgiven him for MK Dons. Not sure why Bursaspor took him on. Suspect we will be lumbered with him - although perhaps he won't struggle for a first team place at that level. ",492,2013-04-28
superhoops,"[at last] It's over!

QPR are relegated from the Premier league. We now have to prepare for a return to the 2nd tier of English football.

With that in mind, who do you think can handle the rough and tumble of the Championship and who can we realistically get rid of?

When it comes to letting some players go, who do you think we have a chance of selling? Bear in mind we are paying higher salaries than clubs like Spurs would normally provide and most of our players have hardly covered themselves in glory.

The canny fans wanted to see how much cash was being filtered off, no credit cards, players paid in cash, £80 PW or an ex-international for £100 PW. There was usually a guffaw of laughter when the figure was announced.

The attendances issue sounds like a big gamble, especially if the rumours today about this 35k seater Air Asia stadium are on point.

I wanted to share my story with this subreddit in hopes that it will be a welcome read to the regulars who have mostly been saddled with linking stories of dischord and dysfunction at the club.

Last summer, I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/vm15q/redditors_ive_spent_over_a_decade_following_the/) thread in /r/soccer - I was headed to London for the summer, and after watching English football from afar for most of my life, I was finally going to be on the other side of the Atlantic, where I always told myself I would take up my local team - naturally, geography placed me right in the middle of a bunch of clubs, and so I had a choice to make. /u/doeboy73 sent me a message about the club, I did my reading, and I was pretty sure I was hooked. I went to Loftus Road and did the tour of the grounds, I became an avid reader of all the news I could get about the club - I was really interested, but I was not hooked.

Then one afternoon, out of the blue, /u/doeboy73 let me know that an additional allotment of tickets had been made available to the pre-season friendly up against Wycombe Wanderers. With a final to take at 9:00 the next morning, I decided to hop on the train and head up to the game. Unfortunately he and I were not able to meet up, but I had the time of my life, got to chat a bit with a few of the players on the touchline during warmups, and I was hooked.

I had to head back home before the season got underway, but of course a lot has changed since I took the train to High Wycombe - a lot of new players joined the team, too many results slipped away, Hughes took the team underwater and Harry could not get it back afloat in time. It became harder to find streams of the games as we anchored ourselves to the bottom of the table, but most weekends I was able to do it, and for better or worse I got up early enough to see the matches I could.

It will be a lot harder to follow the team next year, but between radio streams, the occasional television feed, blogs, and /r/superhoops, I'll be more than covered. It was a rough season no doubt, but it was also the one that exposed me to the incredible supporter community around this club, and it was the season I fell in love with QPR regardless of the results. For that reason, I'll have a hard time looking back at 2012/2013 with bad memories.
",484,2013-05-21
superhoops,"Good stuff matey, all props to you. I'm another convert from this season - at least you have the excuse of having been separated from W12 by an ocean up until this year.

I grew up in a far flung part of West London without a truly local team. While it may be traditional to inherit your team from your elders, this never really happened with me. My grandfather was a Mackem but died when I was 5 months old. My mother told me the stories of him dressing the TV in a Sunderland scarf in '73 for their cup win, but he wasn't around to pass along any passion for the team, who in any case would be a nightmare to support from down here. My mother herself grew up further inside West London than me and used to go to Chelsea games in the '70s, but as a single working mother she didn't have any time to ~~corrupt~~ bestow me with much sentiment for them, although I was impressed when they fielded an entire squad of foreign players in the late '90s. I vaguely recall a handful of QPR supporters in primary school, but they were vastly outnumbered by the usual suspects. A mate took me to a Watford game (David James almost knocked me over in his car afterwards) but I don't come away feeling like a connection has been made. In secondary school it was pure Liverpool (immigrants from the 70s who'd fallen in love with them and passed it to their kids), Man U (bedazzled youngsters), Arsenal and Spurs (local-ish teams). I maintained a respectful interest in the primary goings-on from afar, picked Leyton Orient in CM/FM, and and plodded on as an agnostic.

Fast forward a fair few years. My Actonite other half would occasionally tell me about QPR people with whom she'd come into contact through work. She would complain about Steve Gallen being a moody bastard (although I don't trust her judgement on this). My daily routine took me on the Central Line through White City/Shepherd's Bush most days. Every once in a while I would get caught in a train full of fans going home from White City. Come the 2010/11 season, my girlfriend complains that riding herbike home down the Uxbridge Road on promotion confirmation day is a nightmare as there are drunken fans everywhere going crazy. Around this time I'd started looking for a flat locally and it clicks - I'm actually going to live close to a team. It stings a bit that it's a fresh top flight team, as no-one wants to be labelled a bandwaggoner, but after years of being the only footballing orphan among my peers the lure was too great. I started following the team from afar from then on. I ended up living in Acton in 2012 and as soon as finances were stable, I pulled the trigger and went to Loftus Road.

It hurts and shames me, as a born and raised West Londoner, that I've missed out on this for so long. I still feel like something of a fraud sitting among the QPR faithful - I haven't invested anywhere near as much time, energy and emotion (and £) in the team as they have and even if I live to 80 I probably never will. All those years before silly money kicked in were lost to me. I've bounced around SA Road and Ellerslie Road stands for matches, and had one in the Paddock - I bought my ST for next season centrally in Ellerslie Road as I feel like I'll tread on fewer long-term fans' toes there. Historically, I have nothing to compare the top flight to. I even feel like a clown posting here - but I guess everyone has to start somewhere. On a last minute plan I took my Liverpool supporting mate and his dad to Anfield on Sunday, which was my first away game. I shouldn't have been inviting the enemy among us, but it got me the ride I needed and neither him nor his dad had ever actually been. I still haven't checked up on how he felt sitting among his West London peers supporting a team from the other end of the country. Getting to applaud the guys who came over to us after the match was a fantastic end to my first chapter as a supporter. August can't come soon enough.

superhoops,"I've checked my coffee and haven't found any evidence of tampering.

I'm starting to feel optimistic about next season. I think it's down to the number of QPR players who have come out and said there was a serious problem in the squad. It's what we could all see, but during the season it's difficult for players to admit the issues for fear of making things worse.

Hill, Fabio, Green, Derry, Jennas and Townsend have all said the same, there were serious splits in the team, which were so bad even Harry couldn't fix them.

Everyone now sees the same issues and I hope will work together to fix them.

In a few weeks the transfer  window will open, Harry and the board will have had enough time to sort out a plan. The experience of last summer and the 2012/13 season should have given the board a very harsh initiation into football management, there are no short-cuts.

I expect a majority of last season's players to stay at the club. We desperately need 2 strikers; Johnson and Zamora will be fortunate to play even most games and with up to 3 games a week in the CL it's likely they'll be out injured before we are 2 months into the campaign.
I'd love to see D J Campbell given a chance to play next season, the crowd will adore him and he has shown how effective he can be in the Championship. Let's hope Harry takes punt.


Derry and possibly even Hill are coming towards the end of their football careers, it's time to look for new blood. I'd favor a slow transition, preferably bringing in some of the QPR youth and other players who have the potential of a long stay at the club.


Everyone at QPR and all QPR fans agree on what caused the issues last season, let's hope the board and Harry don't look for  more short-term, quick fixes. Instead I'd like to see QPR build a solid backbone in the team that will provide opportunities to bring in youth. Then, perhaps, we can again see a QPR we are proud of.",357,2013-06-02

superhoops,"It's funny, you look at the squad and at this stage there is quite a lot to admire and make you confident we'll be pretty competitive, especially given the amount of Championship experience that already exists among the players. I think it will be easier to unite the dressing room going down than it would have been had we somehow scraped top flight survival. We can offload a lot of the poison and Redknapp will hopefully make some wiser hires than Hughes did, given his greater experience with management.

Agree 100% that they need to shake up the striker situation. All too often Zamora looked in discomfort after a spell of play in which he was involved came to an end, and god knows what's become of Andy Johnson after his injury. Definitely want Campbell to stay. What about Bothroyd? He scored a good number of goals for Cardiff at this level, but I'd rather they went out and brought in someone younger. All of the above are the other side of 30. Is Balanta worth bringing into the rotation yet?

I was speaking to a Forest supporting mate last week and he was adamant that Leicester are going to spend and be very dangerous next season. Watford will presumably have access to the same resources they had this year. There are some great games to look forward to.",229,2013-06-02

> Rangers are seemingly now restricted to taking a vastly reduced offer from a chancer or – yet again – loaning out a senior player with a view to a permanent move further down the tracks. Remy meanwhile is limited to said loan spell, starting World Cup year in the Championship, or hoping that the charges come to nothing in time for him to catch the tail end of the extended transfer windows in the refuse skips of European football – Russia and Turkey.

As attractive as the idea of Rémy starting the season at QPR is (assuming he's innocent), he is on a substantial weekly wage that I think the club realistically needs shot of for financial reasons. They probably need the transfer fee on the balance sheet as well. That said, I imagine they will be left with one or two high earners come September; if he was one of them (again, assuming he's innocent) I wouldn't complain. We'd still need to address the issues up front when he left in January though. Having an ace up your sleeve for only half a season won't be enough.

Maybe we could work out some kind of loan deal as specified above that includes a future purchase and bundles in a year long inbound loan of a decent young striker.

",248,2013-06-18
superhoops,"With Rémy facing charges of rape and on bail until September it looks likely that we won't be able to sell him until January at the earliest (if he's found innocent). That still leaves him with us for August and part of September before his trial, do we play him with this rape allegation hanging over him or wait it out and hope that he's innocent.

superhoops,"As far as I know, QPR haven't sold one single player this summer. 10 players have had contracts expire and they seem to have been low-salary deals, so will help a little, but are not enough to achieve financial fair play.

I expect this summer clubs will leave buying from QPR until late, they know we HAVE to sell the high earners, that don't have relegation deals. Though they seem to be the players Warnock acquired (Ferdinand, SWP, Young, Barton, Traore).

I would like to think Rémy has a relegation clause, I'd *really* like to think that.

An option is to send Rémy out on loan to a PL club, if not to save some money, it will be to keep him in the shop window; he is a player we likely have to sell if the opportunity arises as he is potentially valuable, we spent a lot of money on him (and Samba) and we can't afford to see Remy's value drop.",163,2013-06-18

A few of them are middies but majority is u-21 offshore attacking talents.  Anyone want to help me widdle this list down?

Depends on which direction Redknapp wants to take really.  To be honest I don't think you can build a Premier League team on veterans.  You have to pick up some talented youngsters that can continue to develop as players right through a Premier League campaign.  Sure, it is a risk but I think Redknapp knows talent when he sees it.  A few years in the Premier League, these players are worth much more and you really have the base to build a real contender in the top flight.

superhoops,"Looking at the table from the last couple of seasons, we need around 70 goals if the team wants to be in with a chance. I'd say we're pretty far off that right now. We could re-sign Campbell, or somehow cough up wages for Crouch, but neither is a spring chicken. The idea of signing the Dwight Gayle kid from Peterborough was probably the right thinking. We might be able to use London as an incentive to bring in a decent striker on loan from a top flight club up north. It's time for Redknapp to put his market savvy into action. I think the owners would be unwise to throw too much money around before the training ground and new stadium are live projects.",125,2013-06-20

superhoops,"I don't know how many of you guys went, but I for one was there to watch it.

First off, anyone wondering why the majority of the away end was closed - the wall at the back is very temperamental, and there have been a lot of problems with the soil below it collapsing (which it did recently, causing the wall to hit someone's car), so it was closed for what I can assume were 'safety reasons'. This left the standing R's penned into a tiny area at the side of the away end.

The match, I think it is fair to say, was fairly dull but no more than could be expected of a pre-season friendly, and each team's first at that. The result was a 0-0 bore draw, where I feel we could have snatched a goal had we actually had a shot, rather than keep on trying to give A.J. a point-blank ranged header, no matter where the crosser was positioned (ahem Mackie). The Bosingwa banter was hilarious, and the triallist from Belgium was actually rather poor. It seems that our most useful signings would be Parker, Crouch and Townshend.

Another sight I was suprised to see was Granero starting, who performed solidly as the midfield playmaker in the first half, despite the heavily-fuelled transfer talk supposedly being held between him and Swansea. The notable absences were Taarabt (no surprises there) and Remy, who having seen today at Woodbury I'd have thought he'd start.

If you have any more questions about the match then ask away, it'd be great to hear from anyone else who went. Looking forward to Saturday (Peterborough away, which I won't be attending) and of course I hope you all come back to Exeter again for the League Cup first round!",298,2013-07-11

3 x Goal Keepers

14 x Midfielders (15 with Traore)

3 x Strikers",155,2013-07-24
superhoops,"Hi All,

I'm interested in getting your opinions on where we are with our squad right now. 
Obviously the transfer window is not over until 31 August, which is about 4.5 weeks away.

**Squad as it stands:**

3 x Goal Keepers

10 x Defenders (11 with Traore)

14 x Midfielders (15 with Traore)

3 x Strikers

**Strikers:**

I'm not impressed by the make-up and shape of our squad. Right now we have 2 strikers who struggle with injury, to the point one of them only managed a few games during the whole of last season, whilst the other is long overdue a major hip operation that may finish his playing career.

Reminder: We let Campbell and Bothroyd go, both proven top Championship goal scorers.

**Acquisitions so far:**

I like the 3 acquisitions we made in, Simpson, Dunne and Henry, they seem sensible and appropriate.

**Leaving:**

It looks like Cezar will go to either Arsenal or a continental club.
Remy to Newcastle. Bossingwa to Turkey. Mackie's gone to Nottingham Forrest. Taarabt possibly to a continental or Arab club. Barton may return to Marseille, if he'll take a big pay cut.


**More acquisitions:**

The Hooper deal has fallen through, tomorrow he'll be announced as a Norwich player.

We will be playing more games than in the Premier League and the physical impact of this league will mean taking casualties along the way.

I think we need 2 new strikers to avoid a bad final position in the table, let alone to stand a chance of play-offs. Otherwise I just can't see where our goals are coming from.

**Team ethic:**

In addition to this worry we do not know if the team issues of last season have been resolved, we cannot blame Bossingwa for everything, there are issues in the squad that must be sorted to the point we are more together than the other Championship clubs.

Am I worrying too much?

superhoops,"All is not lost, shame we have lost Mackie and Hooper but Charlie Austin will be a quality signing, perhaps another decent striker or two will be enough, there were rumours of Crouch not long ago.",36,2013-07-25
superhoops,"Now with Hooper looking at Norwich...
",6,2013-07-25
superhoops,"I was talking to my dad about this earlier, I'm not at all happy with the striker situation. Can we really afford to let Mackie go when we have so few options?",32,2013-07-25
superhoops,"I'm still confused as to who they are planning on shipping out. Are Hoilett and Park staying? Hoilett is one of the [selected players whose personalised kit you can order with a few clicks from club shop](http://www.shop.qpr.co.uk/gb/players/). Why hasn't Granero gone? Diakité? Mbia?

Rumours of a deal to buy out Luke Young have come to nothing. Other than that, as long as Bosingwa leaves, we might as well leave the defensive side of things alone. The three signings seem sensible and sufficient from here. If they can keep other teams from scoring, we might get away with scoring 65 goals being enough to finish in the top 7.

We have too many midfielders. So many that even if they signed Townsend tomorrow, you'd raise an eyebrow. Offload Taarabt, Granero, Mbia and Diakité and the picture should be clearer. The kick in the nuts is that those players are all in their prime, while Park, Jenas and SWP are at the end of their stories and haven't got Championship experience. While people might not have welcomed Steve Kean's warnings about the Championship, his pointing out that his stats people discovered a jump in distance travelled per game stuck out for me. It's gonna be harder on the old-timers legs. I don't trust any of them to create goals, so right now it looks like I'll be pinning hopes on Hoilett and Faurlin, possibly Traoré.

It's up front where it all looks donald the ducked. Even if they bring in Austin and he gets 25, where will the other 40-45 come from? Watford have brought in most of their goal hungry loanees from last season, and even got some Paraguayan to replace Vydra. In contrast we've got Johnson and Zamora. As you say, both are highly suspect to pull a Championship amount of games out of the bag, although they too are available to instabuy as personalised shirts for your kiddies. Can we even hope for 10 goals apiece from them? I hope Johnson does well. If Remy is with us until January, maybe he can add another 10. Then we just need to bag 15 goals from amongst everyone else. I don't think one new striker is enough. Maybe we can loan another one in.

As for the chemistry, it's hard to say without knowing where the specific faultlines lie. Amputate most of the French-speaking mob for a start to fizzle out one clique. Bumping out the overpaid would also be beneficial, but Zamora looks like he's staying and I didn't seem him earn his wages last season. Would I be stretching it to call Zamora one of the worst signings QPR made during the 2 years in the Premier League? In any case looking at contract lengths I think we might be in for a season of detox from the toxic year we just had.

I've completely forgotten Barton amongst all that. And I am not sure how the likes of Harriman and Ehmer get a look in.

superhoops,7th. Just short of the playoff places. ,7,2013-07-30
superhoops,"Slow day at work. Some random predictions.

I'd drop a fiver on us to achieve promotion, a tenner to finish mid-table and 20 to avoid relegation.

I think the squad looks quite nice at the back, and will hopefully keep other teams at bay. I'd punt an uninformed fiver on us conceding the fewest goals in the league.

If we moor off with Zamora and Johnson - as now seems unavoidable - Johnson to be the focal point for goals until teams make more effort to blank him out. One in every two for Johnson and Zamora if we're lucky one in four. Two pound coin at the bookies on Zamora injuring his hip jumping for a ball.

If Hoilett plays well, my crystal ball suggests teams in the Premier League swoop for him in January, and even if the club doesn't want to let him go, the guy wants out.

Barton to return to the pitch in September; some wind-up merchant gets to him by pushing his buttons, possibly in a fake French accent, and he gets sent off. A pound coin on him to be the next QPR player to get a red card.

In the January window, the market favours sellers fleecing teams that need cover for injuries and we sell off some remaining dead weight. Moreover if we still have some of this money sloshing around (keeping in mind that 5 million for Hooper must be burning a hole in someone's pocket) we will also be able to go hunting, with a better understanding of team weaknesses. Ten pounds sterling on us scoring 65% of total goals for the season after January following acquisition of a fresh striker.

I say we end up knocking out one PL side out of a cup competition.

At least one player firing off some stupidity on Twitter.

If we're not in a good position come mid-season, Redknapp to walk. Mutual termination, he already has the biggest house in Sandbanks. Fiver on McLaren taking over in January.",336,2013-07-30
superhoops,"I really think there'll be a hangover from last season and I can see us hanging around mid-table to above relegation until the turn of the year. After that, I think the player quality will come in and we'll be fighting for the play-offs at the end of the year.

Also, I won't be surprised to see Harry leave by January.",61,2013-07-30
superhoops,"Let us start in net.  In my opinion you couldn't have a better keeper in the Championship than Rob Green.  Regardless of the fact he is on the wrong side of 30, his 7 years of Premiership experience will be invaluable this year.  

On defense you are looking at Clint Hill and Nedum Onuoha as the only two who have been with QPR for any length of time.  Newcomers include Danny Simpson, with three seasons of PL experience and Richard Dunne, with a staggering amount of PL experience.  I think these two could be a great asset to QPR.  Lastly we have to factor in Suk-Young Yoon, whose opportunity to shine for QPR is now.  A mainstay for the Korea U23 and U20 teams, Yoon has looked good in preseason and has the potential to make the difference for QPR this year.  We transferred out Bosingwa, Samba and Ben Haim.  In my opinion these players were all cruft and I'm glad they are gone.  Armand Traore looks to be leaving the club as well, with offers reportedly on the table for this services.

Moving to midfield I think we are doing alright.  Stephane Mbia, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Junior Hoilett, Jermaine Jenas, these are the types of players who can be prolific in the Championship.  Even though Jenas is creeping up in age, he was a regular for Tottenham and has enjoyed years of PL experience.  Then we have Granero and Samba Diakite who are excellent but appear to be on the chopping block.  It is doubtful that Taarabt would play and even if he could, I don't think his attitude is welcome at the team any longer.  We cannot forget Shaun Derry whose attitude and work ethic has been paramount to QPR's development since 2010.  He may not feature but his presence will hopefully inspire those on the pitch to step it up a level.  Karl Henry, our new signing in the midfield, had a three year stint in the PL with Wolves and seems to have the attitude that a Championship player needs for his team to prevail.  Lastly, Joey Barton is still a member of the squad and while the past few months have been tumultuous at best, he may find himself playing in the Championship with QPR this season.  His skills would be useful, but I think it depends more on his attitude and commitment to the team.

I think most people would agree when I say that a lot of our problems lie at the striker position.  Obviously, signing Gary Hooper would've been immense but that didn't happen so we all just have to forget about it.  We have Bobby Zamora and Andy Johnson, both are past 30 and injury-prone.  Even though they have both gone on record in the summer touting their renewed fitness, if one of them goes down and we are in serious trouble.  Johnson has looked sharp in pre-season and has an eye for goal, together with Zamora I think the two would do well together.  They each have significant PL experience but truly, I think we need another striker, in his 20's, who can take over the brunt of the work.  With Johnson and Zamora supporting a third striker the team would be complete in my opinion.

So, in summation, and if you read all of that, good for you and thanks.  Give us a £3-4million striker and optimistically I think we can win the league or at the least secure a playoff spot.  Redknapp is a great manager and has always had my support.  Paramount in Portsmouth's promotion and giving Tottenham their first Champions League foray, we are in good hands as far as coaching goes.",615,2013-07-30
superhoops,"I'm rubbish at this sort of thing. Last year I [predicted we'd finish 10th in the PL](http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/y35ty/where_will_qpr_finish_and_why/), so what do I know?

This season I predict we will finish mid-table. The reasons for this are that we have some quality players, but inevitably some of the issues with squad harmony will still exist from last season, there's also still too much churn of players in the club.

I believe Harry is setting up a squad to go straight back up, so he's got one eye on creating a squad that will play in the PL, yet we are competing in the Championship.",102,2013-07-30
superhoops,"It's honestly difficult to predict, like Rob Green said recently, if we assume we'll bounce back up to the Premier League then we could become the next Wolves. I'll go with a conservative estimate of mid-table, however if we nail the signing of a decent goalscorer that stays fit then perhaps a play-off spot is within our grasp.",58,2013-07-30

Nice to see Barton earn his money even though he would rather be elsewhere.

Hoilett's pace was fantastic. 

Don't trust Traoré in defense. Not sure what his starting means - is he off or not? Suppose Yun will start against Exeter.

I'd feel sorry for Zamora if he wasn't earning ten of thousands a week. Harsh to judge him on one game but doesn't seem to be achieving what's being asked of him in the little-and-large routine with Johnson. Hopefully this was a one-off to give Austin time to settle and Bobby will take on an impact sub's role in the future.

Faurlin's string of tackles was fantastic, would've been beautiful if Hoilett's subsequent run had killed the game with a happy ending goal.

superhoops,"*If I have missed something out here or you want to ask me a question about the game, feel free to.*

I was lucky enough to attend the game tonight, and this thread will outline my observations from the St James Road end.

**0-1** To be frank, my view of this was poor as it was scored in the Big Bank net (home terrace), from what I can gather, the ball deflected off Charlie Austin into the net. His first goal for the R's in the second minute.

**0-2** Quality goal scored by Danny Simpson in the 53rd minute, just inside the box at our end, if I remember correctly. His first goal for the 'Hoops and not a bad one either.

**Points of Interest**

* Joey Barton played (started).
* SWP hit the bar and then the post, within minutes of each other after coming on as a second-half substitute.
* We brought 792 fans, a very good showing.
* Barton took all corners, which is arguably questionable but not dissimilar to the norm.
* Murphy played the whole game (thanks to /u/theagitatist for pointing this out).

**My Personal Highlight**

One of our corners at the away end drew Andy Johnson into Krysiak's net, where he responded to some positive banter with our fans and then preceded to have a quick sip of the Exeter 'keeper's drink and then pour the rest out onto the grass whilst winking and smiling at us. All of this was unbeknownst to Krysiak, and the corner was taken as usual.

If you compare QPR to any team in the division, we have such overall quality and squad depth that no other team can match.

We are making lots of positive new signings that have experience of this division and know how to win it, so I personally feel that promotion is easily within our reach.

One of my friends and roommates in college was from Manchester and of course a United fan, so he always tried to make me root for them. I had never been to Manchester though, and didn't want to hop on the winning bandwagon, so I said to hell with ManU. So in choosing my EPL team, I decided it had to be a team based in London, since I had actually been there. Like I said before, I didn't want to jump on some bandwagon like most American fans do and just start rooting for Chelsea, Arsenal, or Tottenham. For some reason, I felt a connection with QPR. However, I fear I may not be a ""real fan"" because in all honesty the way I was introduced to QPR (and most EPL teams) was through FIFA (the game). I really liked QPR's logo, colors, kits, etc. And, I mean, the name QUEENS PARKS RANGERS is just so damn awesome. But I didn't really know much about the team and its history, nor did  I even know of the team's existence during my time visiting London. Can I be considered a real QPR fan? Cheers",221,2013-08-14

superhoops,Zamora is a useless fuck.,5,2013-08-17
superhoops,"A great result. We had plenty of shots, but couldn't find the net. Aside from a couple of breaks through our defence, one from Dunne's (who is the size of 2 houses) poor pass-back to Green, Ipswich hardly had a shot at our goal.

Zamora had another very poor game. Again SWP was beating him to headers. The crowd got quite fed-up with Zamora's poor passing, lack of interception and general lack of effort - he looked very unfit and nervous. I've heard that some fans even started booing him; I didn't hear the booing and hope it's not true.

SWP looked to be playing well and kept winning the ball, he looked pretty amazing at some points with his effort and possession. Jnr Hoilett was great again, I hope his injury isn't serious. The back 4 looked to have improved, though that may have been due to the quality of the opposition. 

Rob Green took nasty abuse from Ipswich fans throughout the game, it got to be quite viscous after a while, because in 2007 he played for Norwich, their rival team, apparently. After his celebration at the end I can't imagine what it will be like when we visit their place.
Green made a great finger-tip save in the first half and generally looked most confident I've seen him, despite the abuse.

Joey Barton had another great game. He received standing ovations from X block and others, we chanted for him several times, including a new one...

So it sounds like all has been forgiven, which is true so long as he keeps putting in performances like those we've seen from him this season. Some of his passing over distance was pretty amazing.

Interestingly Clint Hill moved up into a wing position through a lot of the game, that could have been due to a lack of pressure from Ipswich.

All in all QPR looked a level above the opposition, the issue was the creativity, setting ourselves up for a goal. I also think that Zamora has become a waste of a position, we are starting games with 10.5 players at best, until he is subbed off, then we seem to score.

Will Harry now play some of the talented QPR youth?...... No, he won't.",377,2013-08-17
superhoops,"Wow, brilliant debut for Hitchcock! Delighted, but still much to be done. we'll have it rough this season without a bit more depth in the squad.

superhoops,"I'd rather not lose him early in Sept, as I don't want him to be injured before the 2 home games that month. ",23,2013-08-27
superhoops,"Here are my thoughts:

1) A huge improvement on last season. This was my first game at Loftus Road this season and I was impressed by the team spirit on display. Rather than giving up after the first goal went in as was so often the case last season we kept trying to win the game for the full 90 minutes.

2) Sean Wright Phillips needs to go. He's go pace but that seems to be about it. I'm getting tired of watching him the run the ball to nowhere or getting muscled off the ball. I was down the other end, but it looked like he missed a sitter one-on-one with the keeper. 

3) Zamora needs to take a pay cut or go. I think he's a useful player to have around but squandered too many chances last night to justify his wages.  

4) No 'plan B'. When Faurlin came off Jenas looked lost and didn't know what to do. The confusion ended up leading to their second goal.

Overall, pretty optimistic about the season ahead and looking forward to seeing Barton and Henry play.

superhoops,"Just got home. On the one hand, it's good to receive a shot of humility. On the other, that was a pretty depressing display, and an alarming indication of what injuries can do to us.  Thought it was a scandalous performance in midfield. SWP taking the ball nowhere on most possesions. Jenas playing the friendly ghost routine right until the final 10 minutes. Diakité probably a poor choice to start. Even Saint Faurlin looked terrible. Zamora is just mugging the club off for money now, should've started one of the kids.

YSY looked a lot sharper in the second half - but I am not sure what his hand was held up for prior to the cross that that prick Ranger put away? Whatever. I'd play him at LB as first choice now.

More plausibly, we're being linked to Tom Carroll and Assou-Ekotto on loan. I bought Benoit A-S for QPR on the last Football Manager and he did great, so I'm right behind that one.

Palace have confirmed an offer for AJ, and the rumours are that we have striker(s) lined up to replace him if a deal for Johnson is reached. A loan for Tom Carroll looks a realistic possibility.

superhoops,"We had to slash our wage bill to Championship levels but also add depth and skill to the team, ensuring that the players we were bringing in have the right attitude for success in the Championship.


Let us talk about our transfers out.

D.Cisse - He was on loan last season and took a free to some club in Russia no one cares about. Not sure how much his wage was, but he was initially a €5M signing.

C.Samba - Let's be honest, Samba was a last second prayer to keep us in the PL.  It didn't work and now he is gone, back to the same club he came.  We got €14M for him, and he was on wages of 100k/week.  Good one to get off the books.

J.Mackie - I think a lot of people agree this transfer may not have been in our best interests.  Mackie was useful up front and more specifically, had heart.  Regardless, we sold him to Forest for €1.2M.

J.Bosingwa - On a wage of 60-70k/week, we had to get him off the books.  He took a free to Trabzonspor and no one from QPR is looking back.

L.Remy - Another huge earner at around 60-70k/week, we needed to lose him as well.  Took a loan to Newcastle, it wouldn't have made much sense for him to play in the Championship anyway.

A.Taarabt - At about 50k/week, Taarabt was, yet another high earner that we needed to offload to stay afloat.  Took a loan to Fulham which seems to be a good move for both clubs.

J-S.Park - Another huge earner, taking in about 75k/week.  Took a loan to his previous club, PSV, and got him off our wage bill.

Granero - Initially a €8M signing for QPR, Granero was a flop in the PL and has been loaned to Real Sociedad.  Expressed interest during the transfer window in staying with QPR but wage probably offloaded for wage purposes.

S.M'Bia - Initially a €6M signing, M'Bia had the heart to play in the PL but not necessarily the skill.  M'Bia expressed interest in staying with QPR but has been loaned to Sevilla, most likely due to wage offloading purposes.


Overall, we offloaded about 300,000-400,000 in weekly wages which, for a Championship team, could mean the difference in keeping us afloat financially.  We still have some big earners on the wage bill, particularly N.Onuoha and a few others, but their ability and heart on the pitch justifies their wage.  It is interesting to note however that most of these transfers were season long loans which means all of these players will be returning next season.  This bodes well if we make it back to the PL but if we don't, we could be in some serious trouble financially.


Transfers In.
D.Simpson - Free transfer from Newcastle.  4 or so years of PL experience and at 26 years of age, Simpson has a real chance to solidify a first team place in the squad.

R.Dunne - Free transfer from Aston Villa.  Older at 33 but adds depth at the back with almost a decade of experience in the PL.  Has had some problems with fitness.

K. Henry - €1.2M signing from Wolves.  Three years PL experience. Slightly old at 30 years of age.  One of the big reasons he decided to join was Harry Redknapp.  Interesting to note, he was part of the Wolves squad when they were promoted from the Championship to the PL.

C.Austin - ~€4M signing from Burnley.  40 goals in last two seasons in Championship.  24 years of age.  Austin can make a difference up front in the Championship and has proven it.  He has been sloppy for us so far but when he hits form, we won't be taking scrappy wins any longer.

G.O'Neil - Free transfer from West Ham.  Plethora of PL experience, previously played for Portsmouth.  Adds depth and experience to the midfield position.  Older, at 30 years of age.

M.Philips - €5M transfer from Blackpool.  Young midfielder with one year PL experience.  Relishes the opportunity to play under Redknapp and to make it back to the PL.  Touted by Redknapp as a midfielder with a bright future.  Plays for Scottish national team.

N. Kranjčar - Loaned from Dynamo Kyiv.  Has played for Redknapp before.  Talented midfield with an eye for goal, scoring magnificently on many occasions.  Seven years PL experience.

B.Assou-Ekotto - Loaned from Tottenham.  Previously played under Redknapp.  Excellent defender at 29 years of age should be a wall at the back.

T.Carroll - Loaned from Tottenham.  With loads of potential, he has a real chance to make a difference at QPR.


The majority of our transfers in this summer window have been midfielders.  Two young middies with a lot of potential and three older middies with experience and determination.  We added three defenders who will add depth and experience, especially Assou-Ekotto and Simpson.  We only added a single player up front and I believe striker is the position where we lack the most depth and would be affected negatively the most by a single injury.  However, if the strikers we have can stay healthy I'd say we have a real shot at making it back to the PL next year.",875,2013-09-04

Well we can chalk that up as a lie, and not a panicked one either. The smoke around his departure rumours was the first to be visible, and I haven't even caught a glimpse of him as much as training with us in months.

Surely this guy wouldn't be made welcome among the new look squad this season? We'll probably have to loan him as I doubt there are many clubs in Europe who can afford his current wage structure. Ideally we could move him out to Brazil, where I'm lead to believe some superstars' wages are footed by private organisations for commercial rights as opposed to the clubs themselves. Possible for the Brazil team goalie in a domestic WC year.

We might have enough meat in midfield to actually muscle onto some of his hoof-it-up-the-pitch distribution this year.",148,2013-09-04

Good business from 'Arry on deadline day, bringing in the Tottenham loanees. Honestly, with BAE, Hill, Onuoha and Simpson, I think we have a Premier League-competent defence in them. Our midfield is stacked, as you pointed out, and strengthened by the loan acquisition of Carroll. The one really big caveat is that Austin hitting form and starting to score some goals isn't a bonus or an extra or a luxury, it's a necessity. For the moment, churning out 1-0 wins with grit and fight will do, but it won't last for the whole season.

Tom Carroll looks tricky with his feet but so, so small. Don't think he's suitable for a 4-4-2.

Again, the opposition had clear chances on goal, which they completely missed. Surely we would've been punished had we allowed that in the Premier league.

Zamora had a mostly poor game again, we looked much better when he was taken off.

Hill was easily beaten by pace, something opposition managers will make note of.

SWP kept good possession and often won the ball, I think he's too easily criticised by some QPR fans. He won't score many goals but is someone I like to see play for us.

QPR players were not moving into positions for interception of forward passes until the 2nd half.


It's difficult to criticise whilst we have gone unbeaten so far this season. Hopefully the new players will add some strength in possession and some very much needed fire-power.

superhoops,"It's the elephant in the livingroom, the subject we'd perhaps rather not discuss: Bobby Zamora.

With the turning circle of a London bus, Zamora hasn't been at his best. SWP is winning more in the air than Bobby and in general Zamora looks disinterested. 

From the outset his acquisition puzzled me. As a QPR player I'll cheer him on, but based on his recent performance and apparent lack of effort, I'm not sure he should be in the first team. It was apparent how much better we played without him on the pitch; with Bobby playing it looks like we have just 10 men.

The surprise at the team sheet and the expected 2 up-front formation was audible at the Crown and Sceptre before the game yesterday. Many have been saying we should be able to play 1 up front and 5 in mid-field, particularly with the 12 mid-field players we have on our books.

If Harry wants to play 2 up front, surely Hitchcock warrants another opportunity(?).",168,2013-09-15

Only concern I have with the lone striker model above is that I'm not sure it suited Austin to be jumping for balls like Zamora. I think he needs cleaner crosses from the wing.",88,2013-09-15
superhoops,"[Allegedly another one with Joorabchian's fingerprints on the contract](http://www.oneworldsports.com/stories/source-kio-joorabchian-involved-qpr-fall/).

I suppose we can be charitable to the guy and say that at a minimum he'll draw an opposition defender, but overall should he be playing professional football? Probably not. [This is the Zamora of yesteryear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUlJ-5t4x0E), and the guy on the field yesterday didn't look like even a shadow of him.

What annoyed me was that once subbed out, Austin was left to fill in the target man role. As I said on another thread, I'm not sure this suits the team. All the highlights of his goals over the years suggest he needs to be fed the ball directly into a goal scoring opportunity, not jumping onto the end of long balls (although any fighting for the ball is naturally appreciated). I hope Kranjcar is competent in the air, or we focus our passing to the feet.

Hitchcock's youthful pace alone might provide more opportunities than Zamora, but unless we can field AJ and Austin simultaneously, I'd stick Kranjcar, Faurlin or Carroll or whoever behind Austin.

We're a team with money to burn, first team chances over a long season up for grabs and yet we're only ever linked to Spurs/ex-Redknapp strikers.

superhoops,"Being a Devonshire based 'Hoop, I grab opportunities with both hands to see QPR live, so a trip to Yeovil today was a must-do.

First off, the stadium I would estimate to be full (over 9000 fans in total) and our fans sold our allowance of approximately 2000 tickets.

Unfortunately I bought my tickets late so I had to settle for a place in the crowded Yeovil fans's standing terrace, and being surrounded by livid Glovers for near-on ninety - especially the last thirty - minutes it was a great experience, although next time I'll definitely be booking early for the Rangers end!

The lineup was rather changed from the outfit we started against Brighton on Wednesday evening, eyebrows especially being raised over Barton starting on the bench, apparently he is one booking away from suspension, if true then it doesn't explain why he was brought on for the late minutes, so I can only presume 'Arry was resting him, as from what we have all seen so far, a player possessing Barton's (newfound) traits of fight and determination will be much-welcomed in our bid for promotion this season.

Another point, albeit probably influenced by the Yeovil supporters around me - I have never seen a game where nearly all of the decisions went our way, including the penalty that got us our win - a good decision from what I could see despite being at the far end of the pitch.

The pressure after our goal was intense and unrelenting, however despite Yeovil getting a sizeable number of chances I didn't ever feel that they looked particularly like scoring.

Standout players for me were Benoit, Traore Rob Green. BAE was pulling off a lot of intelligent tricks and skill moves to beat opposing wingers under pressure, and also made some pinpoint cross-pitch passes, all lofted which required very little movement from the recipient. Traore looked particularly dangerous moving forward, especially in the first half by being an attacker who isn't afraid to charge at defences and work the ball into the box. His second half game waned however Tom Carroll performed his role well enough to compensate. Facing a number of difficult curling shots and driven attempts to his bottom corner, Rob Green pulled off some fantastic saves. Had he not been on such great form we could have easily lost the game 3-1 when you compare our chances to Yeovil's.

Ultimately a hard-fought, arguably-deserved win and more importantly three points on the board, keeping us top of the Championship. I feel our goalscoring form will improve as the season goes on and we will beat weaker opposition like Yeovil by three or four perhaps, though some good deals in the late-end of the loan window wouldn't go amiss.

Up the R's!

Edit: As I've said elsewhere, the fixture list is pretty nice, with the majority of the other high flying teams not playing us until just before Xmas. Hopefully we'll have passed the 50% mark of the ~70 points we need to finish top 6, even with this strikeforce. However I agree, and I noted a while back that I can't see where goals are going to come from. Johnson will probably be good for a few when he plays, and he will hopefully be back reasonably soon, but I'd bet he'll rack up a maximum of 4 before he's sidelined again. I feel bad for Austin as the service has been so very, very poor. It's still early days for Phillips and Kranjcar, so maybe they can scrape a few each when they're in the rhythm of things. Fingers crossed Chevanton isn't standing on legs of fine china and has some decent goal nabbing instincts. They're wise to have only signed him until Xmas though.

It's all about the January window now. I would make a play for Nahki Wells from Bradford if they can afford him. Otherwise raid Coventry for some of their strike force. We have an all-round decent team so we just need someone to do a job, not piss fairydust.",219,2013-09-25

I expect we will soon find tougher opposition. Continuing to rely on our very strong defence may not be enough.


Where can goals come from? I don't expect we'll see the new young striker we've bought play in the first team, so we are still down to a single senior striker, Kranjcar has scored goals from mid-field in the past, can he be fit enough to contribute? And if so, can we expect 10 goals from him to get us to Xmas?


Barton and SWP take shots at goal, though not it seems with enough threat. Hoilett has injury concerns and other midfielders have not so far produced potential goal-scoring shots.

Phillips looks like he really needs to get his game up to speed.

superhoops,"I think someone said it earlier, uninspiring. Missed passes all over the place. It wasn't until Burnley scored the first goal that we started getting the ball forward and into attacking positions.

Overall we just looked sloppy and to be honest not a PL calibre squad.  So long as the lads keep working hard I think we can improve though, and it'll be our attitude and work rate that'll get us through.  I'd rather watch players make mistakes than not work hard",82,2013-10-26
superhoops,"Devoid of ideas. We looked genuinely shocked to be coming up against a good team and couldn't change our gameplan to deal with it. Maybe you can stroll about the field playing 40 pass moves at home to a stagnant team like Barnsley but not away to the league leaders.

Harry will need to have some words but he has to take some responsibility. The game was not taken to them and by the time the substitutes came (a bit late) one of them was Jenas. I was mortified. What has he done to justify his place *on the bench* this season let alone on the field? Instead he just does his noble gas impression and finds the quickest way to lose possession. Chevanton should get a start next game methinks.

Dunne and Hill did alright considering they probably had as much posession as anyone in the team. We just didn't get the ball forward... even Austin was a peripheral figure bar a few chances at the end, the poor bloke was completely cut off. Overall really poor and hope it's just a blip, but i'm not certain. It was our first real test against a team in the top half of the table and we failed.

superhoops,"I've just seen the highlights on the FL show, which paint a slightly better picture than I remember, having slept on it.

I think one thing that we are lacking for games like this is youngsters at the right stage in their career. We can have the likes of O'Neil, Henry, Barton and Kranjcar doing a professional job, but we have nothing like Ings, Vokes and Trippier to call upon. Even Austin and Phillips are here on a kind of second step of progression in the game. No-one can question the importance of rolling up your sleeves and doing a job, but for games like this, and it should have been a big one, some cliché fire and passion would come in handy.

The passing routine is frustrating if it isn't creating chances. We had 61% of the possession but only 6 shots. I think we needed someone extra running into the box to support our attacking. Hoilett is no longer inspiring confidence down the wing. I think it's time to give Phillips the chance to show he's up to his price tag, with SWP getting a shot down the other side. Harry's seeming devotion to Jenas is reminding me of Bosingwa's constant selection last year.

Can't begrudge Burnley the victory too much. They had the coach route out of town lined with people waving at us and flipping us off. The coach sopped at the worst service station I've ever been to just above Wolverhampton. All in all a pretty shitty day out.

superhoops,"Scouring other message boards for match reports isn't very fruitful yet, most of the militant fans that made the journey probably didn't get home in much of a mood to write up their impressions. Seems to be split between those who didn't go to the game being satisfied with the point, and those who made the trek, perhaps understandably, feeling a bit of frustration:

*Here's a wordsmith from WATRB*:

> ""Well happy with a point at wigan.""

>If you had been here you wouldn't be.Poor bryond belief.

*LFW traveler...*

>just back....jenas is very poor , phillips near to it 
why qpr fans chanted for johnson kills me, he came on, got thru ..the goalie comes out, taps aj and the tool doesn't go down, i recall many dives for palace....but not for qpr? we pass side to side like crabs, endless..massing up possession with no end product

*And this one...*
>thought we were well organised and keep the ball well. We still, however, seem to lack penetration and Austin remains too isolated. I did think Wigan were very beatable but they have a decent home record so a point is not to be sniffed at. 

*Another...*
> Hoilett couldn't pass water tonight. I counted eleven times when we were attacking and he gave the ball away putting us on the backfoot.

*Last one:*
>We would have been a lot better if Hoilett would pass occasionally although he was our standout attacking player. Austin looked a bit ineffective, although he was being marked very closely. AJ did a lot more than him when he came on.

*And this tweet from Dr. LFW himself:*

>[I know we're all terribly trendy and modern and new age but there is no shame in a) having a shot and b) delivering a set piece.](https://twitter.com/LoftforWords/status/395671755391762432)

I remember how I thought Hoilett was gonna be the bee's knees earlier in the season.  I no longer believe that to be the case. Does he not have the confidence to weight a decent pass when he's moved the ball into the danger area? In theory having a player the standard of BAE should compensate to some degree, but that doesn't seem to be clicking yet. Christ, maybe it's time to give Traoré a run out.

Throwing on AJ sounded like it energised things slightly. Maybe the squad we have suits his playing style more than Austin?

Thankfully Kranjcar's injury can be covered, but with what level of creative quality is the question.

Still...3rd place this far into the season is pretty nice. It's just frustrating that we can't capitalise on that position buy scoring goals. 14 in 13 games isn't really what I'd expect from the millions the Club is dishing out. The next two games should also be tough. How well McClaren knows us could be tricky.

What's frustrating is that, as opposed to merely avoiding doing a Wolves, they've obviously spent the money to chase promotion, and it would be nice to feel comfortable with the table position which still has us in the frame. We had enough players to almost field a team that in theory wouldn't have been plagued by the problems of last year, that they could have grown organically. I don't mean the dross that we shippd out. I'm talking Hill and Onuoha. Harriman and YSY. Barton, Faurlin, Diakité and Phantom man. Traoré, Hoilett and SWP. AJ and...well, prob would've need another striker. They could have spent the money far more slowly, gently adding to that squad. But no point stewing on that now. We are where we are, and in spite of everything that is in the race to go up.",609,2013-10-31
superhoops,"2 points from 3 games is not acceptable. Even though it was a relatively tough run of fixtures, we should be beating Millwall and Wigan away if we want to get into the direct promotion places.

The Championship is a cruel, cruel league, and we need to be a lot more vicious if we're going to keep up with the best teams and vie for the top two spots.

There was some great connecting play in mid-field but the difference was that it lead to something, rather that the slow dying out we've recently been used to.

AJ was tenacious in his constant pushing forward. Bournemouth's backline had to keep a constant eye on him and it was AJ who set-up Austin for his goal.

In my opinion: Harry chooses formations based on his favorite 1st 11 players available to him for each game. So if Austin or AJ are injured soon, we will drop back to 4-5-1.

**That ref decision:** Austin was more than 1 meter inside the Bournemouth box when the ball was punched away from his feet, stopping him from shooting at their goal. That is a red card offense and penalty.

Instead, the ref consulted the linesman for 3 mins then took the ball back 10 yards and gave a simple freekick. I though QPR fans were likely to run on the pitch and assault him. I've never seen anything like it.

Carroll has been out for a while so it's quite hard to give a complete assessment. To be honest though, so far, he hasn't been anything exceptional .. but he hasn't exactly been bad either. He seems to get bullied by the physicality of the Championship, and some of his passes are a bit off.

superhoops,"We have stickies now?! Coooooool.

Seriously though, what a game of two halves that was. I hardly recognised us in the first half. Long balls and poor possession play throughout - pretty much the opposite of what we've been all about so far in the season. 

Then on the other side of the half it didn't take long for the roles to reverse. Suddenly it was Blackpool who were hoofing the ball at every occasion, and it was left up to us to attack and pile the pressure on. The first goal was massively flukey but big props to Austin for chasing the GK and forcing the error. Second goal was sheer clinical beauty.

2-0 away at Blackpool is a huge win for us. Being able to get three points from a tough mid-December away fixture in the pouring rain in spite of a bad start is a very good sign. The sign of a winning mentality. We'll need more of it in the near future.

I also think Carroll is getting better and better. He had some really nice passes today. If the quality of his passes start to match the quality of his vision he'll be a real asset very soon. It was also great to see Onuoha back on the pitch. It's so conspicious how he and BAE are a different class than the opposition. Benny handled his flank with such ease throughout.

The Doncaster and Blackburn games were disappointing, and unfortunately we have only difficult fixtures coming up. But beginning on this run of four hard games we've got exactly the start we needed, and in getting it, we showed the pragmatism and determination that hopefully will see us take points against Leicester, Nottingham and Watford.

**Head-to-head**

* QPR have never won at Nottingham Forest- this is their 30th visit in all competitions.

* Both fixtures ended in draws when the teams were last in the same division, the Championship, in 2010-11.

* Forest won this fixture 5-0 in January 2010, but two of the last three meetings at the City Ground have ended in draws.

Nottingham Forest:

* Forest have drawn four of their last six matches, including back-to-back goalless draws in their last two games - at home to Ipswich and away to Birmingham.

* Forest have not won any of their last five matches played at the City Ground, drawing three and losing two of those games.

* They have lost two of the 12 matches played in front of their own supporters this season.

QPR:

* Rangers lost their first home fixture of the season when they were beaten by Leicester on Saturday.

* But they have kept a clean sheet in three of their last four matches, only conceding to Leicester on Saturday.

* QPR's 2-0 win at Blackpool in their last away fixture ended a run of five away games without a win.

* In 10 Championship away matches so far this season they have only twice scored more than one goal.

* They have scored exactly one goal in six of their 10 Championship away matches so far this season. On three of those occasions it has been enough for a 1-0 victory.

superhoops,"> It shouldn’t have escaped Redknapp’s notice that Forest’s performance was epitomised by a man he felt he had no place for in his team, Jamie Mackie.

Just when Redknapp had won me round a few weeks ago...fickle bastard that I am, freezing out the likes of Mackie, Diakité, Hitchcock et al. might have the pendulum swinging back the other way. Guys like that have their foibles and are unlikely to be the tip of the spear in pushing for a return to the top, but they would have been nice options to reach for last night. There are a lot of question marks in my head over what exactly is going on in team selection right now. For one thing, does anyone know what our best starting line-up is? Especially in midfield? As the LFW post says, what exactly was expected from a starting 11 containing out-of-form Zamora and Henry? Fair enough Redknapp is paid sacks of cash every year to know better than me, but I wanked away enough evenings as a youngster on Football Manager to believe that sometimes you click through to the kids to look at emergency options for a striker. Onuoha's treatment is a bit of a strange one too.

Mercifully no matter what division we're in next season, there will be no option but to rebuild the squad due to the scheduled contract expiration exodus. It might not be such a bad thing for the long term if that is done without Redknapp, whose presence has deprived us of what are for me more interesting possibilities like Rosler and McClaren. Not that I want Redknapp sacked, but if he walks away after a midtable Championship finish the stars might align nicely. The squad he's assembled looks like a castle built on sand right now.

",72,2014-01-04
superhoops,"To be competitive in the Premier League, I think the club needs a dramatic overhaul, which is hopefully already in progress. Consider Barton complaining about the club's 'lower league' mentality when he arrived, and his demands for basic improvements such as extra support for the IT guy.  Consider Hughes coming from a club with extensive scouting reports on most top player across Europe at Man City, remarking that there was practically no scouting system in place at Loftus Road. Consider Mourinho taking one look at the Harlington training ground during Chelsea's need for a replacement while their own was being redeveloped, and writing it off as unsuitable. The last three years must have gone some way to improving this...we know that the new training ground is on its way, at least. In an age where we aren't going to be wheeling out Rangers fans as players, we need to improve the infrastructure as much as possible to foster professionalism and create and attractive working environment from top to bottom. Merely throwing obscene salary packages around obviously doesn't work.

To get promotion...who knows. More goals and a few flashes of luck probably. A decent team would probably help...and to be honest I don't think we have as good a team as we could have right now. I'm not talking about individual players, I mean the team a a whole. Better synched playing styles and understanding. This might take a season to develop, by which time half of the squad will be out the door. I can see a solid foundation of Austin, Phillips, Simpson, Onuoha and Hill (although I fear his time is up)...possibly Barton too. Faurlin, if he was available. ",280,2014-01-05
superhoops,"tl;dr buy another striker, score more goals",7,2014-01-05
superhoops,"Yeah, I would say bolstering the midfield with guys who are premiership quality and in their prime is a must. Enough with the guys who are over the hill and in their 30's. 

Obviously another striker to give us another option would be very handy, although I do think Austin, Johnson and Hitchcock might be enough for the rest of the season.

If we do get promoted I would say another centre half would be necessary. Onouha, Hill and Dunne won't cut it next season. Onouha is god enough but Hill and Dunne will cause us problems.",97,2014-01-05
superhoops,"Many R's are left asking the same questions after today's embarrassing loss against an up-and-coming Everton side.  While most R's expected a loss, they half-hoped we'd be able to keep it interesting.  It was about as interesting for the R's as their attacking record as of late, a paltry 2 goals in 5 games.  I mean, Blackpool of all teams who sit at 12th in the table, were able to hold off the likes of Manchester City as they fought to a 1-1 draw.


If we consider ourselves Promotion contenders, then certainly being able to match up with and compete with PL clubs is the true goal.  We've barely looked as if we can compete with teams in our own division as of late.  Yet by some miracle we are only a single point off of an automatic promotion place.  That miracle however, has a real name, the back four.  Benoit Assou-Ekotto, Clint Hill, Richard Dunne, Danny Simpson, and more recently, Nedum Onouha.  With the exception of Hill and Dunne, now in their mid-thirties, I would have no concerns believing the others could compete in the Premiership.  


The problem has never been our defence though, it has always come from *higher* up the pitch.  Midfield, but more so attack, is where it all breaks down.  Playing up front with Charlie Austin is... you guessed it, nobody.  There is no one playing up front with Charlie Austin most of the time. Somehow Austin still finds a way to make a goal out of it and that has been our saving grace. On some days we can get Andy Johnson into the action for 45 minutes but thus far his fitness has been the real problem.  There's also Bobby Zam... oh never mind, there is no body else.  The addition of Hitchcock back into the side is positive but it will surely take at least one more from the transfer market to get us back in business.  Going forward with Charlie Austin, Tom Hitchcock, Andy Johnson and a January transfer, would surely be a step in the right direction.  And steps they must surely be, for if we take too big a step in too short a time, as we have in previous transfer windows, we will ruin our progress and fall off the ladder completely.

For this reason, the midfield can stay the same.  Between Joey Barton and Matt Phillips, the clear midfield core, we have enough other options to get by in the Championship.  The only other midfielder considered Premiership quality would be Junior Hoilett based on his sheer potential, even though his progress as of late has stalled.  Between the Summer transfer window and our returning loanees we will have more than enough options to hash out a midfield competitive at the highest level of English football.

Today's loss may have made us look a team not in any way deserving of a place in the Premier League but realistically, we are not that far off from being a team that can compete in the top tier. One solid striker in January will go a long way to helping us reach that goal.",524,2014-01-05
superhoops,"The thing that fucked this squad was the fact that we missed out on Gary Hooper in the summer window. Harry's original plan had him and Austin forming the core of the attack which would also be able to keep us afloat in the premiership. 

Thing is, the back line (as you pointed out) is keeping us going. My preference would be to have a mean defense to rely on. Once a system is in place it keeps itself going (and also, in most other sports, it is defense, which wins you big games etc). It then enables us to 'win' ugly, and personally, if we do get points on the board, I'm happy. It doesn't make for a great final product for the fans (at times like today), but being in the top 3 is a great place, especially after the cluster fuck of last season.  

Harry (IMO) had a fundamental change in the way he thinks about football after being fired by Tottenham and when he was thinking about managing England (the whole thing about bringing in Brendan Rodgers and playing a different style).  He has switched to possession based football and packing the midfield, which seems to be the style much more on the continent than it is at home, with that emphasis on one striker rather than 2. Again, had we had Hooper, we may be playing two up front, with a packed midfield/mix of wingers with Barton and another playmaker in the middle of the park. Either way, he wants us keeping the ball rather than handing an initiative to the opposing team (in theory). So far it has panned out at times, but has seen us struggle at other moments, the Championship is much more a slug fest than the Prem, that is what we need to keep in mind. I think the plan was to implement the system this season, with an eye on it being ready for when we're promoted (and I think that the higher ups will be hedging their bets on us going up this season), but we've lacked that second striker/other winger to finish the opportunities we create (Hoilett seems to have a hamstring made of glass). 

Long story short, I think Harry is in the process of trying to implement a new system, while having to integrate a fair number of players. We've done a good job so far of shipping dead weight (though some still remains) and if TF is as keen as he appears, if we add a striker of Jelavic's caliber (hoping the fact that Kranjcar is getting time with Croatia working in our favour!) then we should be find for the rest of this season, baring some minor tweaks (such as a replacement for Carroll if he leaves). I'm still hoping for an automatic spot, as I think out defense will outlast Burnley's strikers and Derby's form as well. 

Anyway, apologies for this wall of text, it's just that I've spent a lot of time thinking about how management, to me, appears to have been trying to think one step ahead this term in terms of strategy rather than looking for quick fixes, which means that we're still in a period where the squad and system are getting used to one another. 

Again, if I'm talking utter shite, then please tell me! 

TL:DR: Striker such as Jelavic and possible replacement for Carroll and we should be good, New System and new way of thinking means this season is a growing period.

In short, the fact that you are interested in QPR at all tells me that you are not obsessed with finding a team of mercenary players and fans that cry if their teams do not qualify for Europe every year.  You, my friend, are looking for the full football experiences.  Welcome to QPR, and be prepared for a ride that will take you from maniacal highs and gut punching lows, to absolute shell shocked moments of disbelief.  Like promotions?  Demotions? Board room intrigues?  Brushes with financial calamity? Strange personalities?  Guns being brandished in the board room?  Kung-fu fights against the Chinese national team?  Welcome to the greatest team in football, a true life-long passion.

Like you, I am an American.  I started following QPR in 1985, totally by accident.  I am a huge fan of the The Who and bought Pete Townshend's *White City* album as soon as it hit the shelves and was immediately struck by this line: 

> Down to the refuge, near QPR, I drive to committees in my German car

I did not actually know what QPR was (and remember, no Internet and Google for random students in those days), but I was pretty sure it was something like ""Queen's public road"" (since he was driving on it).  I finally saw QPR listed in an English football magazine that I picked up in Harvard Square and decided, immediately, that they had to be my club.

I followed the team the only way that you could back then, occasional snippets in the papers or football magazines, but it seemed to get harder and harder as the team slowly drifted down to the third-tier in 2001.  While QPR's fortunes seem to be becoming more and more dire, a funny thing happened though, the Internet really made it much more possible (and fun) to follow a team, even from a distance.  All of a sudden there were fan groups and message boards, YouTube videos, and finally Reddits.

I can only tell you that I have never been more welcome on the Internet than dealing with Rs fans around the world.  Over time I have swapped beef jerky for jerseys and scarves and received packages of programs and Rs gear from wonderful folks.  I have still never made it to Loftus Road, but my boys are getting older and hope springs eternal.

1. If you use Google Chrome install an extension called Proxy SwitchySharp.

2. Go to this URL [here](http://www.proxynova.com/proxy-server-list/country-my/) and look for a server with a reasonably fast speed.

3. Open Proxy SwitchySharp options and configure a proxy profile for the server you picked in step 2.

4. Turn on the proxy before opening the youtube stream page (you might need to repeat step 2 before every game because the servers change a bit).

5. Wait for the stream to load and then turn Proxy SwitchySharp back into Direct Connection mode, basically your normal internet connection.

You will indeed be getting the same bus back to London included in the price. This means that you go straight to the coach after the game though, so no opportunity to sight see in whatever post-industrial provincial idyll to which you're headed.

Nope, and it's apparently illegal and can land the (third party) coach company in hot water.

superhoops,(rumour) QPR plotting bid for SPL striker Stevie May - update: he's having a medical.,15,2014-01-29
superhoops,"Panic buying is infuriating, no matter what the context.

Stevie May actually sounds quite interesting this [BBC article on him](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25854199) from a few days ago. This quote stands out:

> He was quiet and focused. And his work ethic meant he was the last player to leave the training ground.

However we are talking about the Scottish League. If they were reluctant to take Nahki Wells as there'd be a question mark over him for PL football...you'd imagine the same rule applies here.

In spite of what I said about him in another thread, Zamora looked semi-useful last night. Not 50000 notes a week worth, but nonetheless more effective than I've seen him in a long time. It was against a tragic Bolton team though. Nonetheless as it stands we should be able to cobble together a strike force every game from him, Austin, Johnson and one of the kids.

At this point I'm also not entirely convinced another striker is going to make a lot of difference. I'll gamble an opinion and say that - longer term - a lot more playing time together between Carroll and Kranjcar would be more valuable in creating chances. Ditto some consistency down the left wing - another player at Phillips' level down that side of the pitch would be a godsend.

If they do need someone as injury cover for Austin - and I suppose they do, as Johnson and Zamora are not the most robust/versatile of players - then Stevie May sounds about right. I'd certainly rather go that route than spunk millions into Blackburn's account. If we want Rhodes we can try and get him if/when we know PL revenues/Remy transfer £££s are coming our way.

Players Out:

* Samba Diakite

Even prior to the season-ending injury to Charlie Austin, QPR was in dire need of options at the striker position.

A frantic last few days of the January transfer window proved fruitful as QPR landed four new strikers.  After failing to impress with only 3 goals in 31 games, Modibo Maiga, 26, comes in on loan from West Ham.  A Mali international player, Maiga experienced success for Le Mans early in his career, scoring 15 goals in 69 games.  His form continued following a €3M transfer to Sochaux, where Maiga scored 24 goals in 59 for the French Ligue 1 side.

Kevin Doyle, 30, also finds himself on loan to QPR for the remainder of the season.  Kevin has varying levels of Premier league and Championship experience to his name as well as a decent scoring record, with 9 goals scored on average over his last 9 seasons.  Despite running into his thirties, Kevin is a long-time Ireland international with a Scottish Premier Division and English Championship trophy to his name.

Will Keane and Guilherme Dellatorre, both 21, come into the squad rather unproven.  Previously a Manchester United player, Redknapp had this to say about Keane, ""Will is a young player with fantastic potential. He’s got a good eye for goal, leads the line well and will provide us with good competition in the final third. We're looking forward to welcoming him into the squad.""  Dellatorre, a Brazilian, experienced brief success in the second league of Portuguese football and similarly in Brazil's top division.

On the defensive front, QPR welcomes Aaron Hughes and Coll Donaldson.  Donaldson, only 18, was signed after impressing for Scottish 2nd tier side Livingston.  While not expected to see first-team action for a few years, Redknapp is hopeful that Donaldson can develop into a solid defender.  Hughes on the other hand, seems poised for first team action as our primary right-back, Danny Simpson, is out for an extended period of time with a back injury.  Hughes, 34, has been a constant presence in the Premier League over the last decade.  Hughes has also amassed a vast amount of experience at the international level as well, playing for Northern Ireland, and should fit into the Championship with no problems.",397,2014-02-03

The prospect of hanging onto Kranjcar and BAE after this season previously whetted my appetite, but to be honest that is beginning to fade. Even I'm losing hope in the wisdom of having Carroll in our midfield, and I've previously praised the guy for his attitude. Jenas was a pointless signing.

I won't be sad to see the back of Harry when his contract expires or he decides to quit. I just don't buy that he gives that much of a toss about QPR/West London. I'll also throw weight behind what doeboy says - McLaren leaving was a sad loss. The club has been churning out a lot of media content this season, and it looked pretty clear he was a big part of the kick off to our campaign.

I think we will crash out in the playoffs. They need to start building a team, not a motley crew of Redknapp alumni superglued together, decorated with a few extra loan deals. The trouble is there might be serious financial consequences for not going back up.

Maybe things will look better in the morning.",200,2014-02-10
superhoops,"Im a Spurs fan guys, was just wondering how you guys are getting on

Ive seen you a few times this season but not much

Do you guys rate Harry so far?

How are Tom Carroll, Niko Krancjar, Jermaine Jenas and Assou Ekotto doing?

I would have imagined that Niko and Benoit in particular have too much class for the championship?

Do you think you guys will come up?

Hope you do myself, the first game at Loftus Road when Taarabt scored was a top atmosphere",86,2014-02-10
superhoops,Wait what? QPR 'close to signing' Ravel Morrison on loan for the rest of the season?,16,2014-02-10
superhoops,"**Will we go up?** I still retain hope in going up automatically simply because we generally don't drop points against teams lower down the table, and it's possible to lose to teams around you yet still get promoted this way. However I think it'll have to be via second place or not at all. Can't see us finishing outside the play-offs but can't see us going up that way.

**How is Harry doing?** Personally, I think it's harsh to blame him for performances like last night considering how a lot of us have said before the season started that not getting relegated would be an achievement. So as disappointing as it is to see such a lackluster show last night, in the grand scheme of things we're doing alright, and Harry is doing his job just fine in my book.

**Tom Carroll** I think he's very good technically, but some teams in this division are very physical and so small players like Tom will get bullied off the ball, so perhaps last night and at other times he hasn't been the best selection. Although I have watched him play against weaker teams such as Yeovil this season, where I found him to be decent on the ball.

**Niko Kranjcar** He's obviously very talented, and watching him sometimes is like watching Taarabt, although this applies when he's playing both well and badly. He's got some great goals for us this season and at times his individual flair has been very useful, however it can be infuriating to watch him arrogantly give the ball away through deliberately risky passes and swagger around the pitch when we're chasing the game.

**Jermaine Jenas** Haven't seen a lot of him this season to be honest, would say that he's a player we have enough of and don't particularly need to retain, although this obviously depends on who we lose and bring in come the summer. Decent work rate.

**Assou-Ekotto** Similar to Kranjcar in that he is very talented, yet doesn't *seem* to care much for the team, I think that's fair to say. However he has been one of our most consistent performers this season so I'm not going to slate him. The Burnley home fixture recently was poor, because the third goal especially was his fault for thinking he could physically beat the Burnley attacker, but everyone makes mistakes. The thing that made me angry with him was that when he got knocked over he looked up, saw Burnley would score and went down holding his knee instead of getting up and at least trying to win the ball back rather than pathetically trying to save face. That and the way you'd think he'd learn from his mistake yet invited the same pressure and gave away at least two identical chances from the same mentality later in the game, once in injury time. But other than that game he has been great for us.

***

Overall I think to go up it'll have to be in second place, which should not be out of our reach. It's easy to get overly-pessimistic after watching the game last night but putting things into perspective, we're doing well and still have a great chance of going up.",540,2014-02-10
superhoops,"I'd be pretty happy with this move, if Harry could keep him disciplined. I just think we need a bit of youth in the midfield, guys willing to take shots, which we lacked in the last 10 minutes v Burnley.

superhoops,"Disclaimer: I am a misery guts. Luckily most other people on here are far more positive...

We're like Arsenal, in that we can't get results against the top-of-the-table clubs.

I think we'll end up in the play-offs and unfortunately right now it doesn't look like we have the type of team required to fight our way out of that situation.

BAE & Kranjkar are great. We have lots of individually skilled players, what we don't have is a well-developed team. The Championship is particularly about team ethic. With the exception of Hill & Green our team has been cobbled together during this season and continues to be added to.

When McClaren went, it was just a few games before our defence started losing it's shape. We've slowly let more goals in since then. There is a popular idea that McClaren's coaching was responsible for the great results early on in our season.

Harry is great at attracting relatively big names to our club, but what we are not seeing is the formation of a QPR team.

We are usually predictable. In the first half we wait for the opposition to come to us, we often go a goal down. At half-time Harry gives everyone a bollocking, then we get a goal back for 1 point or we manage to win. That can work against poor teams but won't get you anywhere against an organised group of players.

Also: Don't get any QPR fan started on the ridiculous way we started the season with only one predictably fit striker, after letting 4 strikers leave the club in the summer.

Sorry, I warned you, I'm a whinger.",275,2014-02-10

superhoops,"Thought about posting this myself this morning.

>McClaren is a modern-day technical coach, working on shapes and formations, studying tapes and Pro Zone charts. His meticulous preparation for games knocks Mark Hughes' oft-mentioned version into a cocked hat.

I sincerely hope Fernandes et al. find someone similar for the next top man. I worry that detractors who claim he is too obsessed by big names are on the mark, and we'll get someone like Sven in next.

>Gary O'Neil is a regular fall guy – removed at half time on three of his last five starts and after 54 minutes in the game before that and subbed early again here. What's that old line about the definition of insanity being repetition of the same action while expecting different results?

Wasn't a mindblowing signing over the Summer, and to be honest this deep into the season have never thought he brings too much to the party. Giving him a start on the wing over Hoilett, Traoré or even SWP just baffles me. As does the midfield as a whole. I'm not sure why he's switched it up to the 4-4-2 formation now - I think getting more familiarity with the 5 man midfield might have been worth it. As others have said, putting Carroll in the middle of a four man midfield just looks clueless.

I wonder when Onuoha is going to get his chance again? He's young and on a longer contract than Hill and Dunne. Starving him of playing time in his primary position seems a bit short sighted. We don't want another Jamie Mackie exit on our hands.

I quite enjoy the online meltdowns in the wake of these games. It drags on the match experience deep into the night.",292,2014-02-12

I saw the Derby game and witnessed an ineffectual QPR side.  Our goal scoring situation has constantly been under the gun since the beginning of the season.  Just as we were starting to build something, unfortunate circumstance wiped out our progress.  Now we have a few more strikers but none of them can replace Austin like for like.  So now we are playing two strikers to make up the difference but that changes the whole dynamic of the team.  Basically this leaves us building up chemistry from scratch and it certainly showed against a quality team like Derby.  Time, a commodity we do not have, is what it will surely take to become effective in this new system.  We need to hone our skills against some weaker teams, starting with Charlton, and hope for a run of form to develop that can carry us through to the end of the season.

It was going to be difficult even with Austin at the helm, now, it is only going to get harder, and winning promotion through the playoffs now looks a more realistic goal.",209,2014-02-12

[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwqPF5v3MC8) was a big game for the club, to be promoted from the third tier of english football to the second. Although we lost, we ended going up in the next two or so years anyway. The other big game that comes to mind is [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-4UG1S6rQI), which was as big for us as it was for city, as we as good as needed to win to stay in the premiership (although in the end some other results went our way and we stayed in the premiership anyway).

Som players from the past that I hope someone a bit older and wiser than me can tell you about include Gerry Francis (who later became our manager for a while) Trevor Sinclair ([who scored what some people still think of as one of the greatest ever goals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcIR6ftJuk)) and David Seaman, ex-England goalkeeper with funny hair. 

Present players to look out for are (in my opinion) Niko Kranjcar, Joey Barton ([who is about as nice off the pitch as he is on it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XegUySZ7gUA)) and Charlie Austin.

Hope this helps.

Edit: I forgot to mention that at the moment, we aren't exactly the most liked club in the world. About 5 years ago, through various means, we came to be in a situation where we had very wealthy owners who were prepared to spend a lot of money on the club. This hasn't transpired in much improvement as of yet even though we managed to spend 60-odd million more than we could afford in 2012-13.

9' Corner to QPR, really good period of pressure from Rangers - definitely the better team so far. Leeds passing has been poor, we've kept them on the back foot.

34' Back from my break of despair, just after I wrote the above passage Dunne gave away a penalty, I thought it was very harsh and couldn't watch it. Apparently Green saved it, I returned in time to see a free kick converted by McCormack. ('14) Couldn't have got off to a worse start (unless they'd scored the penalty). Seems like our early pressing has been reversed too. Doyle almost went off injured but he's staying on it seems. Before the game 'Arry said we had three more players injured with hamstring afflictions yesterday - but he didn't say who they were.

45' Jermaine Jenas levels just before the break, lovely finish from just inside the box, so controlled. Rangers starting to play again. Corner to QPR gives Hill a free header, puts it wide and is visibly disappointed. Very positive scenes just before the break here, some beautiful play just before the goal too - three consecutive backheels in the Leeds penalty box?

*HT* Watching the analysis of the penalty - at the time I was livid that it was given because I didn't feel it was a pen, and the footage shows that Dunne does just about touch the ball - the lino doesn't give it, instead follows the ball as it rolls out and signals a corner, it was only the referee that thought it was a penalty.

49' QPR playing a lot better, stroking the ball about masterfully.

60' JJ booked for a foul after a period of hard tackling, mainly from Leeds. Vocal support from the Leeds faithful so far, summed up in this tweet I found earlier: 'Any team that sings ""(manager) giz a wave"" does not deserve premier league football. #QPRvLEE #leeds #woolbehaviour' courtesy of @patto1878.

63' Will Keane replaces Junior Hoilett. Minutes later Wickham comes very, very close to putting Leeds in front after Onuoha misplaces his defensive header.

71' Will Keane gets a good chance on the edge of the six-yard box but fails to get the ball out from under his feet. Ross McCormack injured during the clearance - wouldn't be devastated if he has to leave the field. He does so and gets stick from QPR fans, which he almost retaliates to. Looks aggrieved at the injustice done. Him and Wickham limping around gingerly.

76' Traore with a great run, lacking in support however and loses the ball.

85' Morrison makes way for Benayoun.

88' Henry booked.

90' Five minutes added-on.

93' Onuoha with a saving challenge on the edge of the box.

94' Hill scores but it's ruled offside. Good call from the linesman, incredible finish though. **Heart-breaking.**

**FT** Final score: 1-1. Fair result in all, disappointing result perhaps but shows that we can play well. A result to build on for the trip to Birmingham next week.",850,2014-03-01

superhoops,"For me it looks like a statement of emotion rather than economic strategy.

I have seen nothing in the behaviour of the board to indicates a coherent and consistent business or football plan.

Even with the vast riches made available to QPR when in the Premier league, the experience cost the club approximately £64m of debt each season.

Fernandes says there is less to worry about as it's shareholder debt, but it's QPR debt in name and was effectively multi-millions spent for the pleasure of being relegated.

The important question is, is this just the beginning of things to come?",100,2014-03-07

Both Leicester and Burnley have what are on paper four easy games coming up. If we do manage to catch up, it will be right at the tail end of the season, when we at least might have Austin back.

Maybe Jenas' impending contract completion date will boost his game consistently now. The reports from yesterday were quite positive about that particular set up.

~~If this result stays the same then we will be only six points behind them with a game in hand.~~ Their next game is the fixture we have just played, Birmingham away, so you'd expect them to get three points but as others have said, all the pressure is on them now and between now and the end of the season I can easily see where they could lose that lead and where we could gain points. Their run of games is a lot harder than our run of games, so it will be really interesting to see how this pans out.

Yesterday each time I removed the proxy, the stream go for a few seconds, stop and then throw an error. The error was not about the location of my IP address.

I am wondering if they are now checking the geolocation of IP addresses continuously or if it was just due to the technical difficulties they were having with the stream in general yesterday? 

Another thing. When you signup for the QPR Player service you get access to all the teams in the SkyBet. I noticed Derby, Burnley, Bournemouth and Doncaster show the whole match on replay in their team Player a day or two later. This allowed me to watch the QPR matches that were not televised. 

Wonder why QPR doesn't show the matches on replay, especially for those who cannot make it to the game?

Julio Cesar needs to go.  We don't need to discuss why.  We would keep Green and Murphy and look to sign a young GK for the future.

BAE goes back to Tottenham at end of season.  Let him go, don't ever go near him again.  We could keep Dunne, only as a cover mind you, as his experience will help the younger guys in training.  Hughes deal expires at the end of the season, let him go the way of BAE and never look back.

Sign Morrison if at all possible.  Doubtful but, hey, we can dream.  Sell SWP, Henry, O'Neil, Taarabt, Diakite, Park, Granero, M'Bia.  Sure these players could potentially help us but I think an, ""out with the old and in with the new"" approach is more to our advantage.

Taarabt will be interesting - not sure what price he'll fetch on the open market, but remember that Spurs get a 40% cut of the deal.

Hoilett I'm not sure has done enough to justify a large fee and even if a buyer was found I doubt anyone would match the salary deal he is getting here (same probably true for Granero). Can't see him going anywhere to be honest.

Tell that to Redknapp. I'll hold my hands up as a pessimistic clown if I'm proved wrong, but I fully expect BAE in the squad whether we play that wingback mess or with a standard back 4.

I would've said just rest a few fragile players for these last few games and wait on the playoffs, but that automatic promotion spot is still only 9 points away, and with Burnley's injuries and a run in with games against Wigan, Ipswich and Reading...it's tempting to try and get a full strength squad out there ASAP.

superhoops,"I can't dispute your first 11, aside from your omission of Banayoun. Who, in his last 2 games, looked the best player on the pitch. 

For the first half of the season BAE was the best left-back in the league, but went well off the boil; quite a surprise and disappointment.
Suk-Young is 24 and so is the type of player we should be moving into the 1st 11 on a permanent basis. He's one of ours not a loan player. Warnock was anti-loan players for a good reason.

For Saturday the back four pick themselves: Suk-Young (LB), Hill (CB), Onuoha (CB), Simpson (RB).

We should see Hoillet (RW), Barton (CM), Morrison (in-the-hole), Henry (CM) and Benayoun (LW) - I think Benayoun's rise in form at QPR is a good example of how it takes players a while to settle into a club. Both I and some others have been guilty of a lack of patience with some of our players.

I don't want to see Zamora start. He's a 2nd-half sub, who can help keep the ball at the other end of the pitch and perhaps assist in creating opportunities for other strikers. With no pace, he shouldn't start a game.

It'll have to be Maiga starting up front. There are rumours Austin will play. We'll see. He should not be played if it means he'll be gone again as a result.

Keeper: Green (of course).

Subs: Zamora, Dunne, Murphy, Kranjkar, Traore, Doyle, Carrol.

Next year I'd like to see a QPR first 11 that includes Austin, Suk-Young, Hitchcock, Philips... we really have an embarrassment of riches in Midfield, that would compliment a mid-table PL team, it's difficult to really choose our best 4 midfield players.

superhoops,"Yun, Onuoha, Hill, Simpson.  It is tough to argue against Yun joining the squad based on the pace and quality he brought to the squad against Boro a few weeks ago.   Hill, while older at 35, has been a star performer for us on a consistent basis.  Onuoha and Simpson, both aged 27, are in their prime and, like Hill, have been outstanding at the back.  The only issue with this is possibly the lack of a true RB.  I leave BAE and Dunne out for good reason.  BAE had a strong run at the start of the season but has lost his focus and motivation.  If any of the loanees feel like a mercenary at this point it is him.  Dunne is simply feeling the effects of the tail end of a long season.  His form has dipped as of late and frankly we have better options.

Barton, Morrison.  These two will feature in the midfield week-in week-out, without question.  It is the other two, or three, that is the question.  Traore/Benayoun/Hoilett/Jenas, in that order are probably our best options.  Traore, Benayoun and Hoilett are all capable of injecting pace into the squad, which we are often lacking.  Jenas on the other hand was in superb form before his injury and displaying good chemistry with Morrison.

Maiga/Keane.  Lets face it, if we could get Austin I'd send back all the loanees in a heartbeat.  As it is we have Zamora, Maiga and Keane, might as well just flip a coin.  Honestly though, just don't start Zamora.

superhoops,"If I were the QPR manager today, this would be my line-up:

.....

Green


Simpson|Onuoha|Hill|Suk-Young


Hoilett|~~Barton~~ Henry|Benayoun|Traore


Morrison


Maiga


Subs: Austin, ~~Robinson~~ Murphy, Jenas, ~~Henry~~ Carroll, Zamora, Dunne, Kranjcar (assuming he's fit)


.....

That's a pretty impressive line-up. Only Hill and Barton are not viewed as attacking players.


I've put Maiga up front as, with so many forward players behind him, even I should stand a chance of knocking one into the opposition's net. Austin should be subbed on, providing he's available.

This season I've been waiting for both Traore and Austin to be fit long enough, at the same time, so that Traore's crosses can be used by Austin. I think they've only played one or two games together so far. Given time I hope they can form a good partnership.

I removed Barton as he's apparently not available, due to injury. I've replaced him with Henry, who's game has improved recently. Then added Carroll to the bench.


I removed Paul Robinson from the bench, as he plays for Blackburn Rovers.

superhoops,"If you offered promotion to me, I'd take it not only for the money, but also to see what would happen. I can't envisage anything good (other than the £££), but it might be entertaining mayhem. Realistically Championship is the wiser choice - they will have to bring in quite a few players to replace those on the outbound, even if we deployed the squad above you'd still need a lot of cover for probable injuries. It will be far easier to make those acquisitions in the Championship where stupid sums of TV money aren't sending everyone a little hyperactive. This is all leaving aside whatever ball and chain FFP will/won't be securing around the club's neck.

>We're still a Championship club trying to become a Premier League club. I think we should do that one step at a time, with a plan, rather than a short-term smash and grab.

The club has big plans, and presumably the money in place to fuel those plans, but that doesn't guarantee these things will happen. In terms of more tangible assets they have simply got an ageing senior squad of playing and coaching staff, a charismatic but rickety old stadium and a training facility from which Jose Mourinho turned away in disgust upon first seeing it on a quest for a temporary replacement for Chelsea. The Championship is still a respectable league. It provides a decent level to develop a squad for a few years down the line as the board start to get to work on the other projects - as far off as the stadium would be, Warren Farm at least should be up in a few years. That can be the first step in building up some credibility for their competence.

I'm beginning to get a little wary of the power structure within the club though - I can't name a single source for inspiration within the organisation. The media team do a great job..but Fernandes has hardly been in the UK over the season, Redknapp and his people have done their thing, Beard...I dunno. Steve Gallen and co. are presumably powerless. Do we even retain full time scouts? Since Ian Butterworth left I don't know of any. I think merely hoping that there are unknown names keeping things heading in the right direction behind the scenes is wishful thinking. Amit Bhatia needs to focus on proving himself in his other business ventures - not usually possible at a football club - and so I don't think he's in a position to take any more control.

Off the back of tonight, there's at least one positive review for QPR I found:

""[I also felt QPR looked like they'd run out of ideas going forward, and **gave a true masterclass in how to pass it sideways** (made our midfielders look average at doing it!).](http://www.brfcs.com/mb/index.php/topic/30270-rovers-v-qpr-8th-april-ko-745/page-11)""",474,2014-04-08
superhoops,"Baring a complete QPR meltdown and a storming performance by Brighton, it looks like we will be in the play-offs.

Under the circumstances we found ourselves in last season, our current position in the Championship has to be considered something of an achievement for Redknapp.

Looking at the team we have and the state of our clubs finances, I think we are justified in questioning at what cost our current standing in the table has come at and if promotion to the Premier league would be of benefit to the club at this time.

I like to see QPR win games, I'll be cheering us on to win all our play-off games and I hope we make it to Wembley. My fear is that if we do win promotion, are we in a position to capitalise on the opportunity or are we more likely to see a repeat of the 2012/13 season?

I ask this as, although Harry has got us into the play-offs, I fear it's been at a long-term cost. With loan players, aging older signings at the heart of QPR's squad, on-gong injuries and young players sent out on loan, do QPR need another season or two in the Championship to build a team of players that can survive in the PL without completely bankrupting the club?

I think it's time to understand who we are. We're still a Championship club trying to become a Premier League club. I think we should do that one step at a time, with a plan, rather than a short-term smash and grab.

superhoops,"A friend of mine works with 2 Premier football league clubs. Yesterday he explained what happens when a PL team loses a string of games and even moves into the relegation zone.

In his words ""The phones stop ringing and every day in the [football club's] office is a bad day.... modern football is absolutely ruthless""

Apparently potential and existing sponsors stop speaking to the club as they begin to distance themselves from the situation. He said there is a kind of silence, it's common for cracks to appear amongst the staff as the pressure increases and a kind of depression falls over the place, some in-fighting can occur. It's not a nice place to be.

All of this affects the club's management greatly.

I reflected on last season and the absolute mess QPR was in. It's likely difficult to imagine the chaos. I must say, I have a bit more respect for Harry since hearing my friends story. 

The pressure football managers are under is immense. Fans, the media, some players the owners and then the clubs staff; when times are tough all put pressure on the manager. It has to be one of the most high pressure, high profile jobs.

My friend does not support either of the clubs, he's a Spurs fan, yet at least one of the clubs have become his B team as he's gained so much respect for the clubs, he didn't have before.",240,2014-04-12
superhoops,"Will enter my favourite when I get home, going either for the QPR win over Liverpool a few years ago at Loftus Road or the famous win away at Stamford Bridge last year.",33,2014-04-12
superhoops,"Interesting. However I think one of the frustrating things about our dropped points this season is that, bar two or three games, we haven't been on the end of ruthless spankings. It feels more like the hunger to win was never there in the first place, as opposed to the team slumping to a string of poor results.

I will say however that Harry has been in the game for almost all his life, and has become very rich off of it - he is still the 26th best paid manager in the world. If he hasn't developed a thick skin by now I'd be a little surprised. He sticks to his guns so resolutely that I'd guess he handles the pressure pretty well. Moreover I would be shocked to learn he actually gave a toss if ASR decided they wouldn't be renewing their deal to have their brand plastered on Richard Dunne's back next year. I'd say QPR is relatively lucky in that we may not face the same headaches around those kinds of business issues as other clubs - whatever their failings at QPR, the likes of Fernandes, Beard and the Mittal clan have a decent mix of reputation, contacts and business acumen.

His rap sheet is pretty extensive for me now as well - exiled Faurlin, made Mackie leave, stacked the team with his own, failed to survive in the top flight, wasted time on trying to sign Bridge, Parker, Hooper et al., failing to sign enough firepower, glacial wingback formations, overlooking the club's own youngsters, loans loans loans, indifferent interviews, and at the end of it all the evidence appears to indicate the team won't be promoted this year either. For me that wouldn't be so bad. However Harry should be judged by measuring the clubs on-field success against the relative jangling of coins in his pocket.

If anyone is going to grab the team by the scruff of the neck and try to persuade them to pull themselves together, I'd say it's more likely to be someone within the squad.",345,2014-04-12
superhoops,"That's a really interesting perspective. I think it helps explain a little bit about what's wrong with the team at the moment regarding their poor form. Redknapp is evidently excellent at handling the circus of a modern football club - he's a survivor. More often than not he's a winner too, but even when he fails he doesn't self-destruct. He exudes confidence, which must help hold a club together when there are cracks appearing at all levels of the infrastructure.

The downside of all that is that while those qualities are essential for a long career in football management, they've nothing to do with football. Redknapp's game management of late has gone from the bad to the ridiculous. He changes the lineup (and often the formation/style of play) every game, yet it's wrong every single time. He doesn't appear to study the opposition, often playing into their hands. One single example is the way he always seems to leave hoilett out against teams who field an organised lineup to frustrate us, even though hoilett's great strength is that he pulls players out of position - then starts him against teams against whom a short passing is the correct option (and he wastes possession and ruins patient approach play). Another is the way in which he persists with the same exhausted back line that's been shipping goals for months. 

As many fans will remember, however, QPR have had many decent football managers who haven't been able to handle the demands of the club off the pitch. Paulo Sousa springs to mind - clearly a smart guy and a decent tactician, but fell foul of the politics of the Briatore regime (when Dex was sold to forest while Sousa was on holiday, if memory serves). There are very few managers who can excel at both sides of modern management.",307,2014-04-12
superhoops,"In theory only two of the last games involve opposition chasing something - Barnsley and Millwall striving for survival. These matches might present a decent opportunity to work against teams fighting tooth and nail to stay alive, similar to the playoff scenario.

However, he's generally been poor for us, and for me he's just not cut out for the Championship. He's very weak on the ball, short and easily tackled. When we come up against physical teams (most of the teams in the division) you almost feel sorry for him.

He might do better in the Premier League which allows for more technical players to shine rather than the Championship where physical teams will do well. Not convinced by him but technically he's not too bad.",115,2014-04-16
superhoops,"Saturday was his best game this season. He took his first shot at goal for QPR and many of his passes went forwards.

Unfortunately, for much of the season, his performances have been poor to acceptable.  It's a shame.

He obviously has some technical ability and puts a lot into every game. He seems timid and usually easily gives away possession or instinctively passes backwards or sideways. I'm afraid to say he can be frustrating to watch and at one recent game abuse from a small section of the QPR crowd towards him got a bit out of hand.

Hoping for him to show the same sort of performances and the on field leadership that he has shown all season in the playoffs.

Scored the winner for the First Team in his only game. I think I'm not alone in saying that he deserved more chances in the First Team than the 10 mins he got.

**Goal of the Season:** Was very close between Austin vs Charlton and Ravel vs Yoevil Town, loved both those goals. But ended up going with the latter.

superhoops,Like Andy but he needs to be gone come the summer. Contract is up and he's been injured for most of the time he has been with us.,28,2014-04-23
superhoops,I think danny simpsons a fine rb if we can get him (dont know if he's on loan or not). Richard dunne out hopefully and I think clint hill is past it now. We need to find a good partner for ned. Get BAE out at all costs; waste of space. We need a LB and could have yun as back up. ,62,2014-04-24
superhoops,Will be interesting to see if this sells out. If it is Wigan then QPR fans will have the Lower School End to play with as well.,27,2014-04-24
superhoops,"I like your suggested signings. There's no chance Ravel will stay if we don't get promoted (and very little chance he'll stay if we do). More than anything I'd like to see an end to the policy of having 7 or 8 loan players at a time. Apart from the practical difficulties it creates, from a fan's perspective it's simply less enjoyable cheering on someone else's players. As you correctly identify, strikers will be a priority. If the past few windows is anything to go by, we'll get excited about Jordan Rhodes or Stevie May, the media will link us with Fernando Torres, and we'll end up with Harry Kane on loan. 

It's impossible to say right now, and not just because we don't know if we're going up. Harry Redknapp seems busier in the off-season than he is during the season (which would explain a lot); but he may well be off soon. In which case we really don't know what the squad will look like by September.",169,2014-04-24

superhoops,"So we don't know whether we are in the Premier league or Championship (Regardless I view this year as a decent season) because it is extremely hard to go down and get promoted/make it to the play offs straight away the next season.

In my view our greatest weakness this season is creativity, injuries and goal-scoring. (Apart from some boring play) Until Ravel came in Charlie was our only source of goals and when we picked up a few injuries mid-season our flying start to ground to a stutter. Many people claim Redknapp is guilty of not playing the same team week in and week out but he's had to juggle potential injuries all season long. So because 
our squad is getting a massive refresh next season with the below players all likely to leave:

Remy, Barton, Taarabt, Julio Cesar, Zamora, Stephane Mbia, Esteban Granero, Samba Diakite, Andy Johnson, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermaine Jenas and Park Ji-sung and a few of the smaller names. A few will be sold and I'm thinking we will make about £20-£25 million from the sales.

If we get promoted, I have absolutely no idea who we'd be getting in (also don't want to jinx it).

If we are looking for promotion again next year;

IMO - Strikers - Charlie is great but he's had to play by himself for the whole season. Stevie May, Lewis Grabban would be the realistic options and would do well. (Someone like Jhordan Rhodes is the fantasy one). I still think that we need 4 decent Strikers that can be rotated with injury. Maybe pickup Kevin Doyle on a free.

Defenders - Need a RB (Alan Hutton could be picked up on loan or brought on the cheap I know he's got a tempter but I think he's alright) and a decent young CB like Rhys Williams.
Midfielders- Creativity (as we saw this season) Morrison is the dream choice. Looks like he doesn't want to be at West Ham, probably could get him for about £5million but would he play championship football. If not Chris Eagles could be got on a free in the summer.

Anyone got any opinion on this. I am looking forward to the summer because I believe it will be the clear out that we should have done at the beginning of this season and we can concentrate of getting in players who work hard and will like playing for QPR.

I didn't see the game and don't really know how we played, when I saw the lineup I was pleased that 'Arry was fielding a good side.

[They posted an 8 for him](http://www.westlondonsport.com/features-comment/audio-features-comment/barnsley-v-qpr-player-ratings#68324) and named him MOM. Interestingly they comment that he worked well with Traoré - I had been wondering what a left flank with those two combined would look like. It would certainly be quicker than most of what we've been accustomed to.

The trouble is, it's a little late to continue the experiment, and the time to really get a look at him was months back when BAE started to deteriorate. Wigan will surely be fielding McManaman, and who do you trust to neutralise him? We can be pretty sure Clint and YSY will give it their all. Clint might be a good choice for the first leg when we are presumably less likely to play aggressively, but the man doesn't have youth on his side to consistently support attacking play over 90 minutes. What BAE would show up?

I think BAE will get the nod anyway. He's Harry's man. However if he fatally screws up in these games, then Redknapp will deserve all the criticism levelled at him. And if he plays Dunne and Hill over Onuoha in the middle...oh my days.",219,2014-05-04

superhoops,Wigan vs QPR (0-0) Semi-final 2014 Championship Play Offs Highlights [Shorter link in comments],14,2014-05-10
superhoops,"I was impressed by the commitment of our players, possibly the most effort I've seen all season. I can't think of a player that didn't give full effort - though Ravel looked frustrated.

Yesterday showed me the capacity of the team. We are limited, with lots of individual skill. We have problems trying to break defences down, connect up as a team and our passing can leave a lot to be desired.

**Dunne**

For me, Dunne is far too slow, I feel for the guy. His attitude is right; his mind is willing, yet his flesh is weak. He can often defend set pieces, yet can't catch forwards, so pulls them down or trips them. If Dunne is the last man, we are very vulnerable. 

**Hill**

By his own admission, Clint is not a left-back. He doesn't have the pace. However, he is an outstanding centre-back and should be played there.


**Our best back 4:**The back line should be: Simpson, Onuoha, Hill &amp; Suk-Young.

**Hoilett** 

I love Hoillett's attempts to take on the opposition in their own half. He can be direct and , along with Traore, is one of the few players who will run at the opposition with the ball. He's either going to win us free-kicks in adventageous positons or he's going to create chances.

**Traore**

I really like the guy, doesn't always click into a game, but offers speed and, potentialy, direct play. Super fast on the wing. A shame he couldn't hit a barn door...

His forté is crosses from the wing. I don't see why he doesn't just keep crossing into Austin. It's how Austin has scored a lot of the goals in his career.

**Ravel Morrisson**

I don't doubt he wanted to win last night. He just seemed stuck in treacle. Clearly Wigan picked him out and dealt with the threat. But it still feels like he has problems getting himself into the right positon. So little has come from his conribution in the last few games. If he wants my advice, he should take a leaf out of Hoillett's book and just run at the opposition with the ball - but please, without looking for a freekick all the time.

**Mid-field**

Kranjkar has had trouble getting into games for quite a while now, not sure what's up there. I want to see Benayoun start on Monday. I hope Harry's been savng him for that game.

**Our best mid-field:** Traoré, Barton, Benayoun, Hoillett.

**Forwards**

Austin had a few goes last night, but not back to his prolific best yet. Hopefully Monday will see him shine. Ultimately he needs more service, which was lacking last night.
I thought Doyle did OK, helping keep the ball up the other end of the pitch - he's not scared of a bit of posession - some of our players feel they have to pass as soon as they receive the ball or are within 2 metres of the oppositon.

**QPR supporters**

3,500 R's fans went up to the DW. The best vocal support for a long time. Well done to them. Now, lets do even better on Monday. You R's!!!

**The result**

Whlst we'd all have loved a win, the draw was a better result for QPR than Wigan. Make no mistake, Wigan put everything they had and more into last night. We have to be even more up for Monday night to get that win.

Are we ready for the Premier League? No way. But I like seeing QPR win games, that's what it's all about.

superhoops,"I think we really miss Phillips and Faurlin. I say you're spot on with the best 11 to play.

In the case of Yun, I made this comment elsewhere:

>I think there's certainly still an element of risk with Yun as we haven't got a full picture of what he can do, but I'd play him in the first 11 and would have done from a few months back. Effort and speed in one package are not available elsewhere right now. He also has big game experience - the 2012 Olympic Bronze medal match in front of 56k, against Japan with that little Dokdo Islands drama in the background. If I remember rightly the team were promised exemption from military service if they won

Of course he wasn't facing a language barrier in that game.

I thought Ravel's reaction to coming off was quite a good sign for the next one or two games...he is certainly an office temp/external consultant character, but he looks like he wants to perform, which should be good enough for us.

We should never have let Onyewu go. It's a biiiiiiig risk going into these  games knowing that one of Dunne's emergency party tricks is a professional foul to compensate for lack of pace.

superhoops,"Strong suggestions that he's going to be sacked tomorrow after the game against Manchester City.

He has a great record of taking teams up from the Championship and establishing them as solid mid-table sides, albeit with a not quite tiki-taka brand of football.

I'd take him over Redknapp, and I hope Tony considers this. He did bring in some class football players at Bolton like Jay-Jay Okocha, and it would be interesting to see how he did at QPR. I really think he is an overlooked managerial talent, and if he does get sacked from West Ham then they really are a club with deluded expectations about where they should be.",111,2014-05-10

superhoops,Ex-QPR player and manager Ian Holloway offers his support ahead of the Play-Off Semi Final 2nd leg against Wigan Athletic at Loftus Road,23,2014-05-12
superhoops,"What concerns me about Derby is their firepower from all over the place. We had a good few chances last night, and with more luck one or two of them might have hit the mark. I think it'd be nice if we can match them blow for blow, similar to the Burnley home game. That said, who knows what effect the big game pressure will have on them? Maybe they'll be too nervous to go in all guns blazing. The same can be said for us I suppose.

If they stick with 4-5-1, the big question is who helps Barton cover the defenders? Gary O'Neil? Karl Henry? Of course you also have to say a few prayers that Joey himself maintains his cool. If ever there's a time for him not to go pop, this is it.

There's a few Derby fans that have invaded WATRB for discussion - one of them said that he doesn't have the greatest faith in the teams fullbacks. That being the case, I think Traoré and Hoilett could be useful in unlocking their flanks. I'd worry that they'd have too few targets other than Austin though...unless you abandon the lone striker gig and send on Zamora too.

I'd definitely go with Yun...as soon as he came on we immediately had an outlet down the left that neither Hill or BAE offer. I'd seen video of that tricky footwork he employs when taking on a man, but yesterday we got to see it live. If their fullbacks are indeed a weak link then presumably this works in favour of including Yun. I guess you just have to accept the buyer beware label in terms of the same expectations of his defensive play.

I'm not Redknapp's biggest fan, but I will trust him to mix the right selection and tactics for the day. I'm certainly not expecting an easy win. All I ask is that we don't get embarrassed and the players give a good account of themselves. Can't really ask for more than that.

superhoops,"How do you guys rate our chances? Personally I've always thought Derby would beat whoever made it out of our semi-final, but I think we've got a chance. It's not like we got slaughtered at Pride Park, and there were a couple of stand-out performers against Wigan that made me a little more comfortable in our teams ability, with Green, Barton, Krancjar, Simpson and Onuoha all proving solid, and of course Austin showing just how much we've missed him this season. And considering our ability to deal with pace has been a bit of a weakness for us this season, as we saw against Wigan when Dunne and Hill struggled to cope, I think we might have a bit more luck against Derby, especially if we start Suk-Young at LB.

A well organized approach to set ourselves up on the counter and I think we have a great chance. I genuinely hope Zamora plays a part as well.",158,2014-05-13

superhoops,"I think he's had a mixed performance at QPR. After settling in he started off very well with some great creativity  up front. He's clearly very skilled on the ball, making opportunities for himself in front of goal.  His performance has fallen away in the last 4 games or so and he's looked too much for free kicks when in fact he's just lost possession. So he's looked quite ineffective and Harry has tried starting him from the bench. It's possible to see a little petulance from him as he can get his bottom lip out if things don't go his way.
Other than that, he's a very gifted player, Harry just needs to find out how to play him.",120,2014-05-21
superhoops,"Good, creative footwork means he will always have the opposition on alert, but I watched his body language off the ball over the course of a few matches and, while he hasn't displayed signs of being a disruptive player, I worry that he drops out of games if things haven't gone well for him - much as /u/doeboy73 already said. During a period when we were toothless up front, he came in, scored a few goals and won us points. A bit of a luxury player. I worry that he doesn't run into position with any urgency on the attack. Still, he has a few more years to improve his skill set.",112,2014-05-21

Watch out for the Match Thread in /r/soccer, it's predictably a toxic environment right now - top comment is 'Fuck QPR'. Class.

**Match Updates: (will update when possible)**

0' Kick-off at Wembley. Come on you R's!!!

4' Free kick in dangerous place for Derby...

5' Straight into the wall.

6' Corner to Rangers.

8' Long-range effort goes wide from Austin.

15' Good free-kick opportunity here for QPR...

16' ...into the wall.

18' Lots of QPR long-range shots going nowhere at the moment. Derby 55% possession so far.

25' Corner for Derby produces nothing much. Derby have had more of the game so far.

28' Penalty shout for Derby. Looks like a dive after replays, 

33' Kranjcar goes off injured for Traore. Watching this right now is nervewracking, can't imagine what it's like being there. Derby having all the pressure, and when they attack it's with rapid pace. However neither team has created any clear-cut opportunities yet. Hoilett with a good run into the area loses the ball.

41' Great save from Rob Green from an in-swinging free kick that could have gone in had he not been so alert.

44' Traore makes a decent run after a great bit of work from Clint Hill, but his shot is way off-target.

45' Half-time and it's **0-0**. Cagey.

***

46' Back out then for the second half. Come on Rangers!

55' Lots of Derby pressure, corners and crosses. Bobby is preparing to come on.

57' Charlie Austin misses a cracking chance from about seven / eight yards out. Agonizingly close. Bobby now on for Doyle. Best chance of the tie goes begging.

60' O'Neil sent off for a challenge just outside the box. Straight red. In my opinion he was not the last man, Hill was, but we all know what Lee Mason's like. It'll be a shame if it comes down to a poor refereeing decision.

Derby had huge amounts of pressure for the whole game, and unbelievably Zamora snatched it with our only shot on target in injury time. These are the moments that make life worth living. Premier League again next year, hopefully we'll do a hell of a better job than we did last time. And make sure /r/soccer knows about it.

Just incredible. Derby were pressing so so hard, then away broke Hoilett and after Derby had a few great chances to clear it, he kept fighting, won the ball and crossed it where it found Bobby who curled it around the keeper into the top-left corner. Truly unbelievable.

Mine is as follows:

    Simpson Hill Onuoha BAE

    Hoilett Henry Barton Benayoun

              Kranjcar

              Austin

This is with a view so as to bring Zamora on for perhaps Henry if in the last twenty minutes we're looking for a goal and then put him and Austin up front. Might start O'Neil instead of Hoilett and bring him on at the same time if we need a goal. And BAE is a tough choice, main reason I'd play him is because he wouldn't be phased by the occasion whereas playing a youngster like YSY on such a huge game could be too much for him. Going with experience over youth, although I'd leave out Dunne altogether.

Despite what Onuoha, Fernandes etc. said about promotion not being imperative, this will allow us a great chance to keep some players who may have otherwise left e.g. Ravel, Kranjcar etc. and the money from this will allow us to make some quality signings. I'm predicting Rio Ferdinand to join, Joe Cole possibly and maybe even Ashley Cole (wouldn't be for these myself but they'd be classic Redknapp signings, especially Rio and Cole) and some other gems too. The money from the Premier League will also mean our 'debt' is surely settled.

Even if Rio, Lamps, etc. still have the quality, I have a hard time seeing them caring very much about the club. Our 2010-11 squad had so much heart and chemistry, and we fucked it up, not by signings bad players, but by signing players who didn't care. 

Our current squad has been through a lot of changes, but once again that wonderful feeling of  togetherness has started to appear. After last time, I'm just not convinced that a Rio Ferdinand on a free transfer and high wages is what we need. Will he do a job for us, week-in, week-out? If I even have to doubt, that's a big 'no' from me straight away.

So I tallied the defensive numbers from all of the playoff games using match stats from the BBC website. Rangers defense had things on lock. We gave up 1 goal in 312 minutes of play and it wasn't from a set piece either.  Its especially impressive against Derby because we were a man down and they were pressing most of the game. This is a complete reversal of what was happening in the second half of the regular season where it felt like the defense was crumbling under pressure. Let me know if I got any numbers wrong.

We might be in a position to look at that Icelandic guy Finnbogason that was attached to a few QPR rumours a while back. I actually think Kane might be worth serious consideration - a big target man that would come at a better price than Bendtner.

I'd like to be ruthless with the loanees and expiring deals. I'd take Hill and Faurlin back, tell Morrison the door is open if he wants to talk. However the reality is that we've already lost around two weeks business time, and we will have a hell of a lot of players to bring in. I just hope that anyone to whom we offer an extension will have first team alternatives on the radar.

I think now would be a good moment to jump on Reading and Wigan to pick their bones for the likes of Obita and Mcmanaman.

Will Hughes is heavily linked to Liverpool, no? Maybe we can swoop on a player like him being gobbled up by the big boys and take them on a loan.

superhoops,"We'd have to move quick for Grabban, Cardiff are already in for him. I'm good with Kane, and as I said on some other thread I think we might be well placed to look at the Icelandic guy Finnbogason, hoping that he's not a new Altidore.

Seems like Brentford fan Caulker is a popular choice. Looks like a good shout on paper.

There was a name (which has escaped me) that Barton wanted to bring in from Marseille that never happened. It might be worth exploring whatever off the shelf relationships he has that are available from there.

It will be interesting to see in what state Granero returns to us. If the last two seasons haven't reduced El Pirata to a shadow of a footballer, he might do better in this new squad. He'd certainly be playing for his future reputation. We get Diakité back as well. Christ knows what we do with him. However assuming Faurlin, Barton and Henry are the only ones whose future here is currently solid...we need that box-to-box man to replace the Mbia shaped hole. Your boy there Kim doesn't look bad, and YSY's presence might help entice him.",195,2014-05-28
superhoops,"I've wanted Caulker ever since Cardiff showed signs of relegation, but don't forget Cardiff conceded the 2nd most goals of the league. Regardless i think he would be a good choice for 6 mill.
As for Frimpong, he was shit for Barnsley but you are right, he may show some signs of potential and i would rather him than someone who is old and a surplus to our budget.
Townsend should accept a contract. He hasn't played consistently and players such as Chadli and Lamela have been chosen over him, even though they don't show a shred of passion in comparison.
As for the championship options, all of the suggested would be fantastic. McCormack would have his valuation inflated, and i think players like Grabban and Deeney have been overlooked, so we could possibly sign them on the cheap.",139,2014-05-28

superhoops,"Obviously we are in for months of speculation on signing players before inevitably signing 10 players on transfer deadline day... but who could we realistically sign that would be good for us. Mentality and what they would add to the team (also not impossible to shift/would play in the championship)

So for Goalkeepers - Keep Greeno and Murphy. Get rid of Cesar quick! (no business needed)

Defense - Steven Caulker - young, strong and is a good leader. Could poach him from Cardiff for about £6 million potentially swap someone like Samba Diakité with a bit of cash. Family still in London. Also fuck Cardiff.

John Heitinga - Years of experience at Everton. Not too old. Thought he was actually alright a Fulham. Could get him on a free, wages would be average.

Younes Kaboul - He's actually out of contract this summer, probably will be retained but I think he's fantastic. And he's not actually that old. Fierce and a leader.

For LB and RB, I think we could do with a 2nd choice. Traroe will be played as a midfielder. So atm we only have 1st choice for both positions. RB; Adam Henley. I like the look of him, young and also great potential. LB Mitch Hancox. Similar to Henley. Fast and young good backup and potential for future.

Midfield - Robert snograss - Powerful and smart player - loyal, a leader. Wants out of Norwich £5mill. Would work well with Joey in midfield. Great freekicks and corners. Star of a terrible Norwich team last year. £5million probably.

Emmanuel Frimpong - Young and potentially a good player. Could get him with a years contract, low wages. Could be pretty good. Know he was shit at Barnsley but his heart wasn't in it, looked good at quite a few Aresnal games, is an idiot but would have a laugh with Charlie and Joey.

Steve Sidwell - Best Fulham player by a mile last year. A goal scorer even in that shocking team. Already in London. Free Transfer (maybe) average wages. Hard worker.

Frank Lampard - Anyone who says that he is too old hasn't been watching him last year. Made 39 appearances for Chelsea last year (with cups and Champions League) England vice-captain, fantastic fantastic footballer. Don't give a shit that he's Chelski we would be honoured to have him even on big wages. Reckon we could get him for a year contract anyway.

Andros Townsend - We know all about him and we love him ! Would give us the pace and directness I felt we lacked for a lot of last year.

Kim Bo-kyung - Cardiff. Korean. Young. Experience of the Premier League. Thought he looked great in a lot of Cardiff games. Also fuck Cardiff.

Strikers - Gary Hooper - Could get him on the cheap, didn't do great last year but has the potential to be a great mid-table striker. Know what he can do from Celtic. Only negative is he turned us down last year.

Harry Kane - Fantastic up and coming striker. Maybe only a loan but I think he would see this like Andros did 2 years ago. Do or Die moment of his career.

Peter Crouch - The Old boy and one who I know for a fact would play his socks off for us. Would be a fan favorite. Worked with Harry before and knows all about us. Was at Wembley cheering us on !

Championship strikers that would be cheap and good - Lewis Grabban, Troy Deeney, Ross McCormack. All of them have a shot of stepping up to the Premier League. Ross McCormack would be excellent and if we got relegated him and Charlie would fire us back to the Premier League in no time.

Not saying we should do all this business, but 2/3's of it would set us up nicely for a good challenge at staying up and would give us a team that would handle a relegation battle well. If we sold Remy, Tarrabt and Cesar We would have about £20-£25 million to play with and I reckon we could get these players for this price.

PLEASE GOD NO - John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joleon Lescott, Rio Ferdinad, Joe Cole, Benoît Assou-Ekotto. To old, would be in it for the money and wouldn't give a shit about us going down.

superhoops,"Great choice of QPR over fulham, now of all times.
Can't pretend to be an expert on Redknapp but he's known for both doing wondrous things at Tottenham (which was what we all hoped he'd do for us) and disatrous things for Portsmouth (drove them to bankruptcy IIRC, which is what the rest of the world hoped he'd do to us).

There are Financial Fair Play rules regarding how much a team can spend relative to their income, but they are fairly new and inconsistently enforced, so we'll have to wait and see. Maybe someone else can add a bit more?

Fernandes seems to be well-liked by the fans and genuinely 'in it for the long run' unlike some rich owners who see it doesn't go well and bail, leaving the club in more shit than it started. Evidence of this is plans for a new stadium appearing every now and then.

During the transfer window, we've been linked with a number of ex- and current england players, such as Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Peter Crouch. Personally, I'd be happy with Lampard since he's absolute quality and seems to be a nice enough guy not to be one of those high-wage leeches on our funds that don't contribute. I'd also take crouchy as he has prior links with the club (before we got rich) and he's a memory I have of going to QPR as a kid. Not so sure about the other two.

The core of the team is hard to determine since it changes a lot, but this season it's been Charlie Austin, Joey Barton, Rob Green in particular for me.",276,2014-05-30
superhoops,"Although some other fans have suggested we go for the likes of Lampard, Ferdinand, Lescot, etc; other fans feel we should not be aiming for players at the end of their careers, as this is the strategy that got us relegated and massively in debt in the 2012/13 season.

QPR need to be thinking about the long-term, that means young hungry talent. While Tony Fernandes has spoken about recruiting from lower leagues Redknapp's renowned for his love of older PL players he's worked with before. A balance will need to be found.

With this in mind, many think that meeting the requirements of FFP could help save our club.

**Finances:**

This is important, for a QPR fan to know.

When Tony Fernandes bought his 66% share of the club in the Summer of 2011, for around £40m, QPR were in debt somewhere between £10-30m.
Accounts for the 2012/13 season reported debts of £175m, with a loss for that season of £80m.

You'll see some non-QPR fans saying QPR have a wage bill bigger than some of the top European clubs. They are referring to figures from the 2012/13 season, they are not relevant to the current squad of players. Particularly as last summer 16 players were loaned out or left QPR.

Another inaccuracy commonly stated by non-QPR fans is that some of our players were on over £100k per week. Our top paid player was/is Joey Barton on £70k per week. Aside from him, in the 2011/12 season, no QPR player was on more than £65k per week. Still a huge amount of money, but not the 100's of thousands some people keep repeating to each other.

It's sensible to guess the club is now something like £200m in debt. the key thing to remember is that this is all money loaned by the 2 main shareholders (Tony Fernandes & Lakshmi Mital). In a recent Fans forum, Fernandes stated he'd likely just give the money to the club. So failing the FFP regulations is the only danger we have right now.

**The shareholder split:**

* Tony Fernandes (represents a group of friends from Air Aisia): 66%

* Lakshmi Mital (represented by fan's favourite Amit Bhatia, you'll have seen him in the 4 year plan): 33%

* Fans (though these share certificates are likely worthless): 1%

Fernandes is a millionaire, with assets around £400m. Lakshmi Mital is a billionaire and the 8th richest person in the UK. There are interesting stories surround Bhatia/Mittals dealings at QPR with Bernie Ecclestone & Flavio Briatore (the 2 who previously owned the 66% shares). That's a whole other post in itself.

**What are the main characteristics of QPR in the past 25 years?**

**Early 90's:** QPR are one the clubs who first join the Premier league. Finishing top London club & 4th in 1993/4 season. We then sell Les Ferdinand, the next season we are relegated.

**Late 90's:** Life in the 2nd tier of English football.

**End of the 90's/early 00's:** Life in the 3rd tier of English football. 2001: Ex-QPR player Ian Holloway is our manager and saviour - a short golden era in QPR's recent history, with several players and a manager who are QPR fans and manage promotion on an annual budget of £0. Ian Holloway is later controversially sacked as a result of a board take-over by Gianni Paladini - who you saw crying in the 4 year plan. Paladini is never liked by QPR fans.

**Mid-00's:** Back in the 2nd tier of football. The club is in and out of financial receivership. Fans contribute money, collected in plastic buckets, to buy a new player, who turns out to be crap. Alleged Italian mafia involvement and 'pistol whippings' in the board room. The club is about to go into receivership.

**2007:** Flavio Briatore buys QPR for about £200k. Attempts to tun it into a ""*Boutique club*"", despite it being built next to a council housing (project) estate and there being no room for your legs when you sit down.

**2010/11:** the Neil Warnock era. Flavio Briatore steps away from the club, handing his shares to Ecclestone, due to him being suspended from F1. Amit Bhatia takes charge, appoints Warnock. Within 17 months QPR have gone from relegation fodder to Championship league winners, putting QPR back in the top league for the first time in 15 years.

**Summer 2011:** Fernandes buys the 66% stake from Ecclestone, having 10 days left of the transfer window, splurging cash like it's going out of fashion. Warnock is sacked in Jan 2012. Mark Hughes is appointed manager, QPR stay up by the skin of thier teth in that famous PL game against Man City. Mark Hughes then goes about spending many £millions. Fernandes is very very niaive and keeps signing the cheques.

**2012/13:** QPR relegated after winning just 4 games all season, amid player turmoil and severe disharmony.

**Instability:**
QPR has had 16 managers in the past 10 years, been in and out of financial receivership, had it's debt taken from £20m to £200m in 3 years and jumped in and out of 3 different leagues. The one very important thing QPR needs is stability.

superhoops,"Glad you chose us!

Fernandes is a legend, a great guy. He is fairly hands on and really seems to love the club and get involved.

FFP is financial fair play. I don't know all the details but basically there is a limit to the amount of losses you can make (6 million ish i think for championship teams) and QPR made a big loss. I am not sure if there will be any actual problems from this but cost reduction is a key point of moving forward.

Harry's style is abit oldschool. He changes around things too much and in other things he is stuck in his ways and not flexible sometimes.

Core players this season in my opinion are: Green, Hill, Austin, Barton all solid and played most games. Also key this season were Simpson, Onuha, Dunne, Morrison, Kranchar.

We need a fair bit in transfer window, but in reality will probably end up with Rio Ferdinand and a few others. http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/26oooe/actually_good_signings_that_would_be_possible/

I've been half following the EPL for years in the US but could never get into it without a home team so I figured now that i've moved to London, I should see who is closest.  As it turns out Google Maps says I'm a tiny bit closer to Loftus Road than to Craven Cottage so QPR it is.  

I watched the promotion match and also the Four Year Plan documentary and then read a few bits on Wikipedia and some articles on here but I'd love any recommendations on what to watch/read to get some more background on the team history and also on where they stand now (financially and play style and strengths/weaknesses).  

Some more specific questions:

*I know a tiny bit about Tony Fernandes because I love Caterham but not much about him as he relates to QPR.  How hands on is he?  I read about him feeling like he got burned a bit by agents and contracts in the past and that he plans to go about things differently this year.  What is the general expectation on how he will be going forward?

*I read something about potential fines from the Championship over going over budget?  Can anyone give me an explanation for dummies and also any potential implications going forward?

*I know very little about Harry Redknapp or his style.  Any particular games to watch that would give a good sense of it?

*Any players in particular who form the core of the team?  

*What is the team looking to add during the transfer window?

superhoops,"Not much to add to these other excellent posts. You might spot a disparity between the club's reputation among other fans (on r/soccer, for example) and the actual experience. QPR now has wealthy owners, leading to a sharp drop in popularity. The money is a pretty new arrival, however, and football clubs have deep roots. It wasn't so long ago that we had a reputation for playing entertaining, attacking football; and for being a friendly, fun place to watch football. It's also worth mentioning that QPR has a world class charity that runs out of the club.

I realise that was his first year in the Premier League and he's used to having world-class defenders in front of him but what do we do with him for the next 3 years ?

He's not a fan favourite, I'm alright with Remy being on big wages (if he stays) because he's a striker (who by definition are normally on higher wages) and has proven his worth but Julio isn't that much better than Green and Green has just spent a year with us pulling off fantastic saves and being a big part of the club even after Mark Hughes treated him like a (pardon my french) c*nt. He deserves a new contract but I fear they will let him go in favour of César purely because of his length contract. If that happens I would question César's commitment to the club because he is clearly here for his pay check. I'm not saying he was as bad as Bosingwa but still.

We should look to sign someone in the range of 1-3mill.  Dunne is still useful and can act as a cover.  We might want to loan a younger defender in the case of unforeseen injuries.

Midfield PL calibre players goes like this: Barton, Hoilett, Phillips, Traore and Faurlin if he can reach his old form.  Players like O'Neil and Henry could play a part but I just don't see enough skill between the two of them.  We should look to sign a central midfield, as controlling the ball in the midfield is going to be key in the PL.  We should also look to loan a player in midfield.

PL-calibre strikers include Austin.  Doyle could play a part but this is an area where we really lack.  Spend upwards of 6mill on a big, strong striker who can score goals.

As far as the rest of the team goes, drop the old players we loaned out, get rid of the slack and start building from the core that got us into the Premiership.  The positions that need the most help are defender and striker.

At games QPR fans, mostly, fail to show nearly enough support for the team.

Last season our fans were mainly lazy, with an ""*I've paid my money now impress me!*"" attitude. And I think that wasn't restricted to last season. 

I often cringed at the flack Fernandes would get from our fans on Twitter. 
Admittedly he's made very big mistakes,  but there are times and places for that kind of thing.

I also dislike seeing our fans firing insults at fans of other clubs on social media.  It really makes us look s**t.

Edit: AND I hate people leaving before the game has finished. Amongst other things it shows huge disloyalty and lack of support for the team

superhoops,"Alright everyone. Seeing as news is a bit dry on the ground at the moment. I thought we could play a game whilst we eagerly wait for transfer news. What's your unpopular QPR opinion ? Something other fans would slate you for if you voiced it.

Here's mine:

I don't like Taarabt, I think he's shit and that he was always shit. I'm not talking talent because that really would be stupid but I'm saying that he's not a good team-player. What I mean by that is that I believe any team that puts up with him will ultimately be weaker for the experience. 

He's like the kid who wants to watch the game when his team is winning but will turn it off when they are losing. He's not good enough to act that mental, he's not Balotelli.

You can see it in the ways he acted when he was with us and when he did stupid shit like not answering the phone when his national coach came calling for him.

He may have been the goal-scorer who got us to the PL (the first time round) but I think his belief that he is destined for bigger things will always be his downfall and he will never achieve those things because of his ego. I have always felt this even when he was banging in the goals for us.

Secretly I have always wanted us to sell him and it's the first thing I do when ever I play career mode on Fifa !

I know this is not as unpopular an opinion as it used to be (say 2 years ago) but there was a time when I dare not whisper this even on the internet.

I think in 20 years time the likes of Charlie Austin, Clint Hill and Joey Barton will bring back much fonder memories than the likes of Adel.",316,2014-07-01
superhoops,"I think Hoilett is hugely overrated and loses the ball more often than he does anything useful. 
",17,2014-07-01
superhoops,"A) Although a touch crazy, Stephane Mbia was a good player and we'll miss him as we claw around for deals in the market to partner Barton covering the central defenders. Every game I've watched from Brazil, I've kept tabs on central midfielders wondering if there's someone we could use.

B) QPR crowds are woefully unrepresentative of West London demographics and, if serious about chasing growth ambitions, the club should be bending over backwards to bring in locals rather than rely on people/kids of people who once upon a time lived in West London. Very tricky to do without pissing off your loyal punters though.",105,2014-07-01
superhoops,"Oooh, here's mine:
We overrate Charlie Austin.
That's not to say he's not vitally important to us. In fact, his importance to us (because until Zamora turned up towards the end of last season he was our only functioning striker) is part of his over-valuation. We needed him, like a needy girlfriend clings to an average bloke. On top of that, he's so clearly a down-to-earth and amiable guy that the fans get a bit misty-eyed about 'our Charlie'. He's an old-fashioned footballer, one of us, the kind of player that's been in short supply over the past decade as our squad has been stocked and restocked with foreign loanees. Even down to his name - QPR have a predominantly local fan-base and are a community club - many of us have mates called Charlie and dads who drove Austins. The way he plays is the same, nothing fancy, just an honest number 9. 

To be clear, I share many of these feelings, have sung his name week-in-week-out and missed him in the months when he was injured. He's one of my favourite players. I would love it if he took the PL by storm. But my unpopular opinion is that almost none of the admiration (or even adoration) is based on footballing reasons. Take the emotion out of it and he's a good, functional Championship striker.

superhoops,"/u/glovemachine makes good points. For me the biggest concern is what miht have been a preview match against Everton in the FA Cup back in January. [We fielded a pretty complete team](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25531987) and got rolled over like we were Brazilian. Fair enough it was only a cup tie, but that was our one brush with Premier League opposition last season and the game still had some weight.

Another factor to consider is the adjustment to the wage budget and the sum they have in reserve to actually put towards new players. While we aren't lumbered with the salaries of the likes of Luke Young, AJ and Park, we're not exactly in a position to exchange like for like. A lot of the money that has been freed up is just working us back towards a more 'sensible' (if such a thing exists in the PL) wage bill. Throw in the fact that Remy and Taarabt's ~100k/week are still our responsibility, SWP and Cesar are surely going to mug us off continuously and Barton, Hoilett and Onuoha must all be handsomely paid too...I'm not sure we're in a position to be handing out £42k a week to the likes of Caulker willy-nilly.

Here's another scenario/monday morning office fantasy - the club ends up spending very little, brings in 2/3 players and accepts that relegation is a given, but over the next 4 years ends up being a bastion of financial common sense, even breaking even at the season's end, with youngsters getting a chance and the squad competing for promotion with modest financial doping from the parachute payments.

However i think it will be a lot tighter and come down to the last few games!

2: rumours are Arry will be playing with with cb with wing backs 

with what i can only assume would be a back three of Rio, Caulker and Nedum Onuoha.

Danny simpson on the right and Yun Suk Young on the left.

as for the Midfield it is hard to say what our strongest 11 is with various players coming back fro injury and Adel Taarabt still Lurking around the training ground.

Striker we have Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora however with todays breaking news that Remy failing his medical at Liverpool, could the football gods be gifting us with his return?

3: this season could be big for 1- Charlie Austin, 2- Matty Philips and 3- Yun Suk Young.",154,2014-07-27
superhoops,"1. It will probably be a struggle. Last season owed a lot to letting in very few goals prior to Xmas. With our defensive enhancements maybe we can replicate that against some of the poorer teams. 12/13 is fresh enough in the memory that we are pretty realistic with expectations.

2. Wingbacks!  Redknapp experimented with them a few times last season to dismal effect. Hopefully with a bit of pre-season preparation we will be more effective with it this time, although we don't have anyone obvious to cover the right side. Danny Simpson is a hard worker but not exactly terrifying for opposition defenses.

3. Matty Phillips, Armand Traoré and Charlie Austin I guess...although I wouldn't highlight anyone as particularly prolific. The team unit will hopefully be more than the sum of its parts...but with Redknapp's deadline day shenanigans we don't know what the final squad picture looks like.",149,2014-07-27
superhoops,"1. This season is going to be hard, especially if Arry cannot manage to sign a few key players to fill in positions that are vacant e.g. Two striker, a back-up RB and a creative CAM. If he can pull these signings off, with players who want to play for the team, then i a very optimistic.
2. Arry has been hinting towards a 5-3-2 or purely a 5 at the back formation with supposedly Yun/Traore - Caulker - Rio - Onuoha - Simpson. The midfield would probably consist of Barton, Fer (If he signs) and a new CAM. Up front is Austin and another striker, possibly Remy given this mornings news.
3. Austin - Phillips - Traore/Yun (Both have similar potential)",122,2014-07-27
superhoops,"1) As other posters have pointed out, it won't be a cakewalk. However, I think the players we have in the squad are more suited to the Prem than they were to the Championship. So I think anything from 20th through to maybe 13th is realistic (if the table is anything like it was last year).

2) By all accounts we will be playing a 3-5-2 with Rio as a sweeper behind Caulker and Onuoha, with two full backs, currently Danny Simpson and Yun Suk Yung. The battling midfield will consist of the ever-present Joey Barton (love or hate him, he works his ass off), supported by a combo of Matty Phillips/Armand Traore/Hoilett on the wings, backed up by SWP with Austin and another striker up front (currently we only have Zamora on the books, but he figures to be more of a back up than a regular starter). 

3) **Barton** - we struggled without him last season, he does the little things, tackles, moves forward, picks out players and isn't afraid to get stuck in. When he's feeling it everything seems to click. **Austin** - without him it felt like we would never score last season, he works hard and he has one hell of a fairy-tale/feel good story (having been a bricklayer not too long ago!). Great finisher, looking for 8-12 goals from him. **Hoilett** - a winger who has days when he seems to be utterly unplayable, but lacks consistency and seems to be made out of glass, but hoping for a few great games which could save us from the drop. ",265,2014-07-27
superhoops,"1. I believe we will just about avoid relegation. Maybe with a week to go we will secure another season of Premiership football. That would be a successful season for us.
2. Redknapp is opting for a 3-5-2 formation, with Rio, Caulker & Dunne (or Clint) at the back. Mid-field will probably have Faurlin, Barton & possibly another signing or two. Front two would be Austin & Remy (if he stays or possibly another striker or two we might be signing like Deeney).
3. Austin; he had a great season with us and after failing the Hull medical has a lot to prove in the premier league. Barton is finally maturing as a player under the guidance of Steve Black and might have his best season ever, Caulker who will be learning from Rio and looking to get into the England team.

1. will be 3 or 4 points ahead of relegation at least but i think there is potential for a higher finish

2. looks like harry s playing three at the back in pre-season preparation but i see harry going back to 4 at the back if it dose not work at the start of the season

In the run up to the Premier League kicking off I am posting, on /r/Soccer, a preview of one team per day - [example from last season](http://redd.it/1kfj34).

Around this time in two days I will be posting QPR’s preview and I’d love contributions from this sub to be included in it. We have a main writer for each preview who will be dealing with club history, last season and the manager, so I’d like to get your comments on:

1. This season: how will it go?
2. Tactics: (formations, squad depth, etc. If you can give a possible line up, then great).
3. Which players should other fans watch out for? (Max. three players.)

I’m asking for fairly short comments that can be posted in the main threads. If you want to write more I will post a link to this thread, so it will not be wasted. Whatever is included in the preview will be credited as your words.

Cheers.",163,2014-07-27
superhoops,"Would be massive for us to retain Remy, even until January.",11,2014-07-28
superhoops,"Thought we should discuss whats going to happen with Remy. 

So what we know is that he's got a Relegation clause and a Champions League clause. 

Relegation Clause is void because we are in the same league now. We don't have to sell him.

With Liverpool backing out that's all the Champions league clubs out of the running IMO. Chelsea won't come for him, neither will City and Arsenal don't want to spend £80k a week.

Next up are Europa league clubs. Tottenham, Everton and Hull. Spurs and Everton may come for him but he won't want to sign for Hull. Extra money for them, believe it's up to £15m (he's worth £20m-£25m in my books in Ulloa is worth £7m now).

The other clubs not in European competitions have little to no chance of signing him. Newcastle fans think they are a shoe in to get him now but I really don't think Fernandes will sell to a club that will possibly be fighting relegation with us next season at some points and he's actually said he will refuse to sell to them at points last season. Further more to Remy playing for us or some mid-table club is totally irrelevant same amount of games... same football. Newcastle is historically a big club but right now it's just a mid-table contender no better than Sunderland or Stoke IMO.

So I believe we have a good chance of keeping him for at least another season as come January (unless we are looking safe by then which I doubt) we won't see in order to try and keep ourselves out of the relegation battle. Obviously Redknapp likes him and Tony likes him. 

With Deeney maybe coming in, it's the first time I can remember when we are looking at the start of the season with 4 fit strikers who can all score goals. 

What do you guys think.... will we be able to keep him ?",325,2014-07-28
superhoops,"If he's effective enough I think he'd jump ship to a CL suitor in Europe in January. Either way if he stays surely he'll be playing with a little extra fire in his belly. Two strikers who will want revenge on Premier League teams that shafted them on medicals - Austin/Hull and Remy/Liverpool. I kinda like the sound of that.

Hopefully now Fernandes can get to work on trying to convince him to stay. Either way it's vital we sort it out soon - getwestlondon ran an article claiming the club are furious and that would be understandable. Given he just played for France in Brazil and has pedigree at two big clubs (Toon and OM) it surely came as a shock to them that this has fallen through, and that throws a big spanner in their budgeting...8mn presumed inbound now wiped off the board and that 65k or whatever no longer taken out of the weekly outgoings. By this stage they must have got a lot more militant at regulating spend, and in light of that those aren't trivial sums. If we've already started negotiations and offering cash elsewhere based on that money coming in, then who knows how serious the domino consequences will be? We're 19 days from kickoff so we can't be fucking around now, if Remy wants out then we're going to be sitting on our hands waiting for his agent to fondle someone's testicles in Italy or Spain or France or Russia for, what, a week? Then we will only have 12 days to make signings based on the refreshed financial situation. The fact that we are allegedly back in for Kranjcar makes me wonder if they are getting a little desperate.

It's less hassle for all involved if we try to convince him to stay for at least the first half of the season.",310,2014-07-28

2. You have the whole of the food court in Westfields (shopping centre) if you fancy some food. Alternatively there are quiet a few places to eat on the highstreet and gastro pubs.
3. If the kick off is 3pm get there for 2pm if you want to breath in the atmosphere abit. The players warm up and you can get a handshake from Jude the Cat if you are lucky. If you turn up SUPER early you can see the players entering the ground sometimes.

Etiquette wise. Don't cheer the opposition.... ever. For the game they are your mortal enemies to be hated. Don't wear the opposition colours. Don't block peoples view if you want to take pictures. Feel free to talk to people if you want.

You will hear swearing, probably some of the most colourful swearing you have ever heard... directed towards the pitch so be prepared. If you get talking to someone don't be afraid of your lack of knowledge, just don't pretend to know stuff about the club you don't or else you'll end up looking like a tit.

Lotfus Road is one of the few old old school stadiums left in the bigger leagues. You will be surprised how close you are to the players. I say enjoy it because it's near the end of it's life now.

P.S if you call the club before you go you can get them to read out your name and a bit of info at half-time. Like ""Luke from USA town has made this big trip to come see QPR for the first time""... Then you might get a cheer if we are doing well in the game.Check out the shop if you feel like it after the game.",348,2014-07-29

superhoops,"The food in the ground is incredibly shit, I'd almost recommend trying the cheese and onion slice with burned plastic melted into the pastry just to say you've survived it. The White Horse on Uxbridge Road has the best atmosphere of the pubs between Shepherd's Bush and the ground. They won't let you in without a ticket to the game. If you're willing to go more off-road there's nicer ones, like the Adelaide. Where you sit depends on whether you prioritise atmosphere or view. I like atmosphere so would say the R block or X block, but they're in the corners of the ground. I quite like heading to my seat with only 5 minutes til kick off - that way as you head into a stadium that's packed and jumping. It's a big buzz.

3. How early should we get to the grounds?

Even if we have Caulker and Onuoha with Rio as a sweeper, you don't really want the likes of Hazard/Sterling/Silva running at the back line. We lack cover, and it leaves our wingers in interesting positions, as they'll have to sit pretty deep at times (although they did so during last season in some fixtures). 

We will also need consistency in selections as we try to get used to the system, we can't have the shuffling we had last year, as I think Stax hinted at that too. 

It'll be interesting, either way, if we go after players like Mutch we do seem to have learned a few things from the last time we were in the Prem. ",142,2014-08-02

We need more strikers to put the goals in, which have clearly been lacking. Due to the new signings and formation we'll likely start the season slowly, so, if things don't start well,  I'll hold back on criticism for a while.

superhoops,"Hard to make a final call until we have more answers at the end of the transfer window...but I'll play the doom-monger of the sub: bottom three. I have real concern that some of that form from the tail end of last season will carry forward. On the new formation, I worry that Redknapp is a ""let them play"" type manager and Jordan and Bond are ineffective disciplinarians. This being the case, I think that we'll struggle to implement it very effectively. I think we will rack up quite a lot of draws thanks to the defensive additions, but not enough to counterbalance the lack of 3 pointers come next May. The issues around being ineffective up front have been in place for a year, and for whatever reason (unlucky loans, harsh market) they haven't been resolved.

I also still think Remy will go, possibly at a criminally inconvenient moment.

In this worst case scenario, all I ask for is that our season is alive until almost the end, and we're not relegated with 4 or 5 games left of the season.

You never know though. Hoddle might come in and revolutionise our game. Remy might stay and bag 15 before Xmas, relieving pressure on Austin who bags another 5 himself. We might frustrate opposition attackers to the point that we get a special feature piece on Rio, Onuoha and Caulker on Football Focus in late November.",237,2014-08-11
superhoops,"I think that we should do relatively well for a team that just got promoted. i don't think that we will be building any momentum until a fair few weeks in. 

We have pace down the back with a probable formation of Traore - Caulker - Rio - Onuoha - Isla/Simpson. All of these players quality enough to suffice.

Midfield will be weaker with Barton, Faurlin and Mutch. This is where i would like to see players like Diame, Fer or De Guzman slotting in. If we can sign either one of these three as well as pen a one-year deal for Collison, i do see enough skill to seal a **14-16th** place finish, of which i would be more than happy.

Our forward line on the other hand is a bit sketchy. Remy and Austin are class and could possibly be the best pairing i have seen for a while in my short QPR following, but we need more strikers. Bobby Z has been performing quite well IMO. He has made a real influence in the last 20-30 minutes of our past games, and should be a good sub even in the prem. I still think we should have got Stevie May, who signed for Sheff Wednesday, but i think if we signed another striker on the lines of a Deeney (but not a his price) we should be fine.

Overall, **14-16th**.

From then on I just started following their results and eventually I started watching them.

When we were playing against each other, I was scrolling through Premier clubs, and spotted the Rs. They shared a similar name and color scheme to my favorite sports team (NY Rangers, a hockey team), and my friend said they played a tough style, like the Rangers of New York, so I figured why not? Played as them, ended up beating my friend (I think he took it easy on me), and from that point, I decided QPR was my club. 

Now, around 4-5 years later, I've grown to love and care about the team more and more, and can not be more excited for this upcoming season. The Zamora goal last year was one of the most cathartic sports moments of my life.

superhoops,"To be honest I thought the team played well, plenty of chances and when we actually controlled the ball in midfield and played football we looked halfway decent. However I felt like all day we missed having someone to take on players and make things happen. Also, I feel gutted saying it because of how integral he was to us last season but Danny simpson might not be able to cut it in the wingback role and i'm interested to see what Isla has to offer. Our starting eleven for me against spurs has to see hoilett getting in somewhere.

                                        remy austin


Also it was great to see Faurlin back out there and I'm not saying he played bad i just think we need a spark in hoilett to create more chances for remy and charlie. I think the subs should be zamora and matty if we are down a goal and ale and henry to hold a lead. 


What do you guys think?

",173,2014-08-17
superhoops,"I think as many predicted, Simpson will not work very well in that wingback role, and I thought it was risky on the whole even bothering with it at all given Isla couldn't play, although I gather that roadblock wasn't finalised until very late in the day. In contrast to Simpson I thought Traoré was fine in his position.

My other main concern is Remy - so obviously talented yesterday, but his body language worried me a bit. I hope he stays until January but I'm not counting on it. His footwork is something that Charlie and Bobby don't have. I doubt Sigthorsson has it and at this stage even with big money we won't be able to buy it in.

Elsewhere I'm not so stressed. We were unlucky to come away with nothing. 

I thought the defense were ok, even with Dunne. It was good to see Ferdinand barking out instructions to everyone looking like he meant it; any concerns over his signing should be put to bed for now, it looks like he brings a touch of that classic Man U dressing room in a way that Park couldn't.

I liked the look of Mutch, and I'm hoping he develops into something special for us. He was running around with an intensity that Kranjcar, Carroll and Ravel didn't serve up last year in my opinion. Faurlin's distribution is adequate. Maybe Barton needs to roll back his duties a bit and stick to adding bite at the back of midfield.

Question is - if Fer comes in, who would he replace from Barton, Faurlin and Mutch? I might be tempted to pull Barton to be honest.",277,2014-08-17
superhoops,"Its difficult to say exactly what we need to change as we did do well but it just didn't end in a win. But here goes.

I don't think Dunne is good enough bring on Onuoha.

Hopefully Ferdinand's mistake will make him inspire him to do better as he wouldn't want to end his career as a flop.

Simpson for Isla?? Possibly, at least try it out for a few games.

Faurlin for Hoilett?? I like them both, so not sure here.

I don't like Barton taking set pieces as too many just lead to nothing.

Austin and Remy looked good but couldn't get the ball in the net, I perscribe them 10ccs of training under Hoddle.

Caulker, Mutch and Traore all were good.

Fer if we get him definitely can fill a role we don't have at the moment in central midfield.",143,2014-08-17
superhoops,"Either Charlie and Remy can't play together, or they need to figure out who plays off the shoulder of the last man and who comes short. There was no partnership there at all. I didn't think Mutch had a brilliant game but he'll improve, plus I think we'll buy a number 10. I was concerned before the game that Faurlin and Barton and co would struggle for pace and physicality, but they did well.",74,2014-08-17
superhoops,"I loved Faurlin's determination and clear pride he has in the club. By far a player you want on your team and i don't think he needs to be replaced.

Again....Richard Dunne. The guy is a rock and i think he played well despite my preference in Onuoha. Would like to see Onuoha play against Spurs as i believe they will be a bit more pacey and suitable to Onuoha's attributes.

BZ may not be the best sub. He is quite slow on the ball, and would rather see a new striker fill his role.

Remy is class, especially in the first half. Austin was OK and didn't really look confident in that penalty kick. Would have given it to Barton, especially at that moment of the game.

The only changes that i would make is Isla for Simpson if he is as good as HR says he is. I would also swap Dunne for Onuoha. Overall i was really happy with the performance. My god were we unlucky to score at least two goals, but we have to perform on set pieces as it is becoming ridiculous. HR said that we played far better than last season in the Championship, and i couldn't agree more. Looking forward to Spurs, and ready to post the BZ ""there is no need to be upset"" picture on my Facebook to piss off my brother.

superhoops,"Phillips is still young and a PL debutant so is probably more amenable to being used from the bench in situations when we shift out of the wingback formation for whatever reason. The guy put in a nice ball or two into the box so I'm keen to see more of him.

Simpson is a bit more of a head-scratcher; if we are planning on playing a good chunk of our games in an alternate formation with a more traditional 4 man back line, then he shouldn't want for playing time. Otherwise, the harsh reality is that he's a (perhaps unsuitable) backup for Isla, or someone you wheel out to sit on a lead. Cup games too. We saw Traoré fulfilling the role as required on Saturday, getting into those one-on-one footraces chasing balls down the wing. He has the pace to do that, Simpson usually won't. Maybe there will be a game or two where they'll know the opposition have to line up with someone slower for whatever reason, and they can give him a run-out.

I remember getting the lowdown on him from Newcastle supporters just over a year ago though, an they were all adamant he is a decent, hardworking defender but limited in attack.A year later, I don't think they were telling lies.",217,2014-08-18

superhoops,"I was thinking about the signing we have made for our PL season and I am actually really impressed. I could be eating my words in 6 months but I believe the board and Harry have made incredible signings. 

Defenders: Caulker, Isla, Rio.
Midfielders: Fer and Mutch.
Forwards: Remy (maybe keeping)

IF Vargas (counting my chickens before they've hatched of course) comes in we have got 4 strikers.

Rio, Isla, Fer and Vargas all have experience playing 3-5-2. Isla and Vargas already know each other from the national team. Both set to be on loan and need to impress to be signed. 

Caulker (and has played for Harry) came in to play with Rio. Rio came for Harry like Fer. After the Liverpool transfer fell through it appears that Harry has been putting his arm around Remy to bring him back into the fold.

It looks like a well executed plan in the transfer market. A thousand miles away from Hughes bungling ""just buy whoever's good"" tactics.  Of course we need this to translate into a decent season for us but I am really impressed at the moment. 

If Vargas signs I am expecting probably an attacking midfielder (a true number 10) and another Central midfielder before the end of the transfer window (loan or buy, probably at least one of them a Spurs player) and honestly I couldn't have chosen better players myself (for us to sign I mean).

In most of the major positions we have got at least 2 choices (of which I rate both as good).

Am I just being to optimistic after years of being confused with our transfer policy ?",276,2014-08-21

We are nothing like the squad from two years ago, nothing.",39,2014-08-22
superhoops,"Caulker, Mutch and Fer were great for their teams.  Maybe some of the best players there.  If the team went down, it was because the team wasn't good enough, not the individual player.

Isla and Vargas can play anywhere in the world and be ""good enough"".  I hope they can bang around with the big boys.  Maybe Fer, and his physicality in training, will be their personal instructor.

I think you hit on something with the new formation.  If they are committed to it for the long run, it should work.  You either build a squad around your formation or vice versa.  They can always go back to another formation later, if injuries knock out the wingers.",117,2014-08-22
superhoops,"doeboy's comment is hilarious. Personally, I never remember thinking Barton was bad, but I've never really disagreed with this sub much. huh. This year I really think Ferdinand is going to be a letdown, though. He'll be not dissimilar to Samba. Mutch will play well, Fer won't be anything special, and yet again, Barton's temperament will get the better of him. However, the worst performer of the year, I predict, will be Vargas.",73,2014-08-22
superhoops,"http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/z639q/congratulations_qpr/

I thought I'd drag up a thread from 2 years ago too discuss our summer transfer window. (Not digging out doeboy at all) but you can see how much opinions change and how quickly. 

I remember that transfer window well because I remember being at a wedding saying to a friend (Norwich supporter, now in our position last season) that we had signed too many quality players to go down (Julio Cesar ! Remember when you heard we signed him !). I was also confident because of what Hughes said at the end of the Man City v QPR game ""We won't be in this position again"".

However we all know how that panned out.

I am feeling very positive at the start of this season but to be honest I was feeling that way at the start of that season. What do you guys reckon, are we heading for another nightmare Premier League campaign ? 

If we put a negative spin on our signing (instead of the positive one).

Caulker, Mutch and Fer were relegated with their teams. Caulker played every game of that season and Fer/Mutch was pretty close to all their games.

Ferdinand played 12 games last season (mostly as a sub) and is 35 years old. Quality is still there but I don't know if his legs are.

Isla and Vargas are totally untested in the Premier League. 

We have never played 3-5-2 and when Harry tried too last season we got spanked.

Don't get me wrong I think we have a lot of potential but there are also worrying signs there that remind me of that season. I never gave up on the team, but there were times I was embarrassed to be a QPR fan (Bosingwa for example) in that season. Seeing Wigan going down swinging and us limping to death in a corner.

However the major difference IMO is how much the lads seem to like each other this season. Steve Black and Hoddle should make the difference. ",336,2014-08-22

superhoops,"A few thoughts.
1.  obviously Dunne can't play. It has to be onuaha, and redknapp is a fool if he thinks otherwise
2.  the 3-5-2 might have to go. The back 3 needs help from the wing backs, especially when Rio and dunne are in. Therefore Our midfield is overmatched because its 3 versus four or 5 opposition players. 5 in the back leaves us incapable of going forward effectively but also defending in the middle of the field
3.  fer needs time to get adjusted. Very unfair to toss him in today and expect even a decent performance.
4.  there is no life in the attack. No one wants to run at defenders or make anything happen. I think hoilett needs to play, even at the expense of Mitch, who has been sub-par. 
5.  finally however, we need to remember you can never take anything from one game. We were bad, Tottenham was good. No need for massive upheaval or panic. Nothing to do but adjust and improve. And hopefully stay up",173,2014-08-24
superhoops,"I'm surprised we have this inability to notice what is going wrong. 

Last week we conceded through a set-piece. Same thing happens this week, it's like we're not doing anything on the training ground. We gave the Spurs this game, woeful defending. And by the time we make adjustments (i.e. moving away from the 3-5-2 we're already 3-0 down and the match is basically over). 

Hopefully this lights a fire under the team or we will be in for one hell of a long season. ",85,2014-08-24

Even a tactical dunce like Redknapp can't carry on with this 3-5-2. Almost everyone was crap, but rather than pick out particularly weak players the blame must go with the manager. No one knew what they were doing, the new players aren't bedded in at all, and the team selection and tactics couldn't have been worse. We've picked up exactly where we left off in the Premier League - a hopelessly mismanaged bunch of talented players who don't know their roles.",106,2014-08-24
superhoops,"Drubbing.  Not flattering.  Too many misplayed passes, inability to retain possession in midfield.",13,2014-08-24
superhoops,"Just heading back now. Basically welcome to the premier league ! I think you can pretty much expect to lose when you are playing against spurs at home (their first home game) under a manager. I thought we were average but they were great. We are bringing in two new players to the side and Remy is clearly not match fit. A lot of people getting on his back ... He had absolutely no service and Austin was injured last thing. On these sorts of games you need luck because Tottenham is a £150m squad. They will be pushing for champions league this season. We are just the first to go under the knife. If any team in the bottom half of the league had come up against spurs they would have got smashed. If anybody is expecting points of the top 6 clubs you might as well give up supporting QPR right now and save yourself some heartache. We need luck and mistakes to make an impact against teams like spurs and that isn't going to happen on the first home game with a new manager. 

It don't feel it is like it was 2/3 years ago, I think we are going to do our struggling now to sort it out for the second half of the season. Look at palace and Sunderland last season the whole league had written them of just 2 months in. They were comfortably safe by the end of the season. I'm not going to say ""in Harry we trust"" but had he ever been relegated when he's had a whole season to form a squad ?",273,2014-08-24
superhoops,"Rightly so.  Firstly, Onuoha should be starting over Dunne.  Secondly, starting two new signings (Isla, Fer) against a top seven side like Tottenham, was probably not the best way to introduce them to the squad.",35,2014-08-25

Now this is all knee-jerk reaction to the Spurs game but I could see it gaining traction if we struggle in the next few games (and lets be honest Sunderland have been doing well and then we have Utd)  but I really hope Harry is given his chance. 

New formation 3-5-2, new players, new league. All will take a bit of time. He should at least be given until January and if say we don't have 20 points on the board (or there about) then we should be asking questions.

The Spurs game came to early. We were unlucky to get at least a draw against Hull.

We have a much more stable platform to work from because of Harry and we have a much stronger squad. Still very early days in the league and I think it would do much more bad than good to be looking to get rid of our manager this early.",165,2014-08-26
superhoops,"I think it'd be crazy to sack him now, if we do only have 20 points at January then he's the best man to bring in quality.

However I'll still put on my optimist's hat and point to some good impressions I got from the first half of the Hull match. Plus I don't think we can realistically have expected to ride through the season without taking a drubbing or two of this magnitude. I'm no Harry fan but jettisoning him now would just be a tad trigger happy I think.

Last night Jason Roberts referenced us talking about the 3-5-2 on the radio in the aftermath of the Man U defeat - he said that we looked a bit clueless in the first half and the players didn't look like they knew the system well enough? Any truth? What annoys me about this is that - fair enough we've got a new bunch of guys in - we were playing with wingbacks as far back as Charlton away back in February. It's not as if this is some mystery intergalactic doctrine dropped onto QPR by a spaceship landing at Harlington. Hopefully Hoddle is still just getting started.

One thing I will say - apparently he waved to the Spurs fans when prompted by their chanting, even when we were significantly down? I hope the same people that threw hissy fits as if Mbia's Marseille tweet was a notarised statement of intent, or Cesar had taken up moonlighting as the Chelsea reserve GK in that scum shirt and fuzzy wig, were just as vocal at that.

Fernandez will be thinking he left it too long with Hughes last time.

Harry has opted for a 3-5-2 system,at least partly due to criticism of toothless football last season. Problem is the change has come at a time of an influx of new players and a season back in the top league. In retrospect that is too much too soon.

superhoops,"I don't mean this to be a rant but I must say I've not been surprised by some of the reactions to the Spurs game. I enjoyed a summer of being happy to be a QPR fan but I knew once we got a battering/beaten soundly some of the Bipolar QPR fans would be calling for ""Harry OUT"". This was generally not what happened last year in the Championship (probably because we won most games).

These are mostly the online fans I find (tweets and forum). 
An example is: http://www.wearetherangersboys.com/forum/showthread.php?182577-All-Aboard-The-Gravy-Train&amp;s=dd6e926e8c010147bc8d8155e0c9c2d7

The ones at the games are more realistic and this subreddit is more sane. But I was thinking why do we have fans like that ?

I think it comes from the years of being the so-called richest club in the football league. The expectations of some fans seems to be bizarre, when we sign someone like Ferdinand or Vargas we are going to be pushing for Europa league and when we lose 4-0 to Spurs (a team who collectively must be worth about 4 times more than ours and pushing for champions league and would have probably battered most teams on their first game at home) we are already relegated. We are not rivals to Spurs, we are not Arsenal. Maybe if we stay up for 3 years we can take a different view on a game like that.

I wish some people could have the perspective of nearly going into administration just over a decade ago. Here are the expectations we should have for this year: Try to stay up. This is the same for every promoted team and half the league. This season is a gift. We were one shot on target away from not making it. We are lucky to have the staff we have at the moment and we are lucky to have got rid of some of the horrid players we have signed over the past few years.

Things will get better but our best performances will be further into the season. I mean look at Man Utd, trying the same formation and getting smashed by the likes of MK Dons. All things take time. We have 36 more games to go. Anything could happen.",371,2014-08-27

That sums up some of the perspective that QPR fans take, and in reality all fans. Harry has been brilliant in my books. Any manager that can take a team straight back up, especially given our circumstances come the end of last year is a fantastic manager. Sure now that we are here in the Prem our standards have risen, but to finish 17th as we all should want requires some losses. I know that our last game wasn't inspirational by any means, but it is a hurdle that we will need to get over and build from. From that game we shouldn't be expecting Dunne to play over Onuoha, shouldn't necessarily see new faces until they are comfortable and we shouldn't concede with such ease. All of which should have been learnt in the past game, although i would have rather it been sought out before the season.

superhoops,QPR FC on Twitter: We'll have some transfer news to reveal at 7pm... #WatchThisSpace #QPR,15,2014-08-29
superhoops,"Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp says he may sign a contract extension ""today or tomorrow"".

""Tony Fernandes has offered me an extension of two years. I'll sign it and won't even read it,"" says Redknapp.

""He's been asking me for a little while, I have just not got round to doing it. Maybe today, if they put it in front of me I'll sign it.""

""I think one or two might go,"" says Redknapp. ""If people come in I'd like to freshen it up. Seven of the team who played against Burton were here when we got relegated. I'd like to change one or two around but we will have to see what happens.""

Redknapp adds that he is ""hopeful"" of sealing a deal for Reading's 24-year-old goalkeeper Alex McCarthy and that Crystal Palace have made an offer for left-back Armand Traore.

""It's up to Armand really. It's his decision if he wants to go,"" says the R's boss",160,2014-08-29

If I was looking at another team and they had these players I would say it's definitely a mid-table team. Of course this is QPR so nothing goes that smoothly. 

Also out of the promoted teams we have done the best business IMO. Could have done with a new striker but it sounds like Defoe is a done deal for January.

EDIT: TAARABT as a forward.... interesting !
",253,2014-09-02
superhoops,"A am very glad we did not get him. Not the right kind of player we or anyone needs (personality wise, we do need a striker).",26,2014-09-02
superhoops,"No brainer for me. As long as he isn't paired up with Zamora. I have unhappy memories of that particular strike duo.

You make a good point about how he doesn't defend (as famously proclaimed by Redknapp on MOTD when discussing a Fulham match last year), and yeah, with the signings we have in Sandro, Mutch and Fer on top of Barton we might be able to accommodate him on occasion. ",71,2014-09-02
superhoops,"Interestingly enough the 25 man squad released by the Official twitter account has Taarabt as a striker. Now I know he's played this position once or twice but I think this could be a real work of genius if handled correctly.

One thing we know about Adel is he doesn't like the defensive side of things and we currently have a packed out midfield. But if he is used as a back-up striker or a false number 9 he could be very effective. 

Of course all this depends on Adel himself. He may just throw his toys out of his pram again but this could potentially lessen our striker problem until January.",112,2014-09-02
superhoops,"While I'd love for him to be back in the fold, he just doesn't want to play for us. I watched him when he was at Milan and he put in effort on the defensive end. He was mostly played on the wing and he was helping his full back out for the most part. Now he still wasn't exactly great, but he wasn't a liability. He cares about Milan. He doesn't want to stay with us now that he's had a taste of Milan. Until that attitude changes and he's ready to give 100% to the team in training and during games, I don't think he should play.

The one thing I don't understand is how no one has been able to convince him that if he wants his move to Milan, all he has to do is work hard here and show that whatever risk Milan take will be worth it. Even if he has the ulterior motive of trying to convince Milan to buy him, if he tries I'll welcome him back with open arms. 

One last thing. How the hell does he get so fat as professional. That's probably another reason he isn't going to Milan. Who wants to spend millions yet still be made to wait half a season for said player to get into shape",221,2014-09-02

[#MOTM vs Middlesbrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0VrwM8QNSs)
[#MOTM vs Millwall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0VrwM8QNSs)

His quality cannot be denied.  Kranjcar enjoyed top form under Redknapp in the 09/10 season when he scored 6 goals for Spurs.  It is hoped that his renewed focus and fitness can see the man reach that great form yet again.

Overall I like the look of the squad, with the two obvious shortfalls of a back up striker for Austin and Vargas and a true rightback.

I'm still a little baffled as to why we sold Simpson, and why Redknapp said last night that they accepted an offer for Traoré.

While I'm a little pissed off that they didn't source a striker, I am glad they told Borini and whoever else where to stick it. Unless Tony & Co spend the January window swigging from bottles of Jack Daniels, I can't see our spending plunging us embarrassingly into the red this season.",111,2014-09-02

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

superhoops,"My gut feeling is that if we sit back and let Di Maria, Falcao and co come at us, we'll get a kicking. For this game I'd like to see us go for it. Utd lack a strong CM as is well documented, and Van Gaal will be under pressure to pick all his galacticos. This will leave them defensively weak in midfield. The plan is Traore and Isla getting forward from full back, stretching their midfield 3. We then hit them hard and fast through the middle, exploiting the space created with 4 from Hoillett/Mutch/Fer/Phillips/Vargas/Austin. In the meantime Sandro and Barton shadow Di Maria and Rooney, who'll be dropping deep to accomodate Falcao up front.

For me the main concern would be the left back position being exploited by Di Maria. However I think we should have enough pace to throw at Shaw and Rafael on the break. They surely have to come at us, they need to go for a win. Two punishing goals off of counters, then we could sit back and try to hold on.

They made quite a number of signings and it may take a couple of games for them to settle in.

Kranjar looks a bit shaky, was out of position a few times Mutch or Barton would have been better.

superhoops,"I told myself before the game that i couldn't care less about the result, as long as we show pride and passion. I finished watching the game knowing that he played horribly. Not as bad as Tottenham though. Greeno had a horrid game. The first goal was not his fault. It was a hard ball to predict, and reminded me of the shot Derby took in the final. The other goals though, Rooney's in particular, should have been saved. But Greeno wasn't the reason we lost.
The whole approach to the game was a recipe for disaster. United have a pretty inconsistent backline, which we did not exploit, and the only reason as to why they haven't won beforehand. Playing Clint as LB was again not the right approach. Within minutes Traore made an impact and if he could shoot, then we probably would have tested De Gea. Phillips probably should have scored that scramble in the first half too.

I think we will beat stoke. The game we played against Sunderland was completely different, and should test Stoke. A win next week will boost confidence in fans and players as it did against Sunderland after the Spurs game.",199,2014-09-15
superhoops,"Fundamentally I think we were outspent here. The positives for me were Traoré going forward (still always dodgy on defensive duties though) and Vargas I thought looked ok.

Having slept on it, the midfield choices seem odd to me, with us never having started Niko, Sandro and Fer before. As happy as I am to see Niko back, I don't think he should just drop into the starting 11. What was wrong with Mutch? I think he would've been a better choice for defensive work.

Also starting Hill is a bit of a piss-take. If this was honestly part of their gameplan as a plan b to the wingbacks, ie putting out a fullback with some bite, they should have put focus on bringing in someone new.

Other than that, meh. The next few games will be far more important for our survival, methinks. This game was actually pretty boring from a QPR perspective. I'm glad I didn't go.",159,2014-09-15
superhoops,"Have to say I disagree with you about Greeno. The only goal I felt he should've done better with was the third, he shouldn't be beaten at his near post by that. If it wasn't for the lucky first goal reasonably early on it may have been very different, I thought it let them settle and if we'd been able to keep them out until half time they might've got frustrated and panicked. Maybe putting 10 men behind the ball was the wrong approach on the day, but I can't see what taking a more attacking approach would have achieved other than making us more vulnerable at the back. Hopefully Sandro's injury isn't too serious, he will be a very important player for us. ",124,2014-09-15
superhoops,"As well as Chris Mendes being the son of the Cargiant MD, podcast host David Fraser works for (founded?) Frank PR, which handles Cargiant's PR activities.

[Cargiant's revenues a few years back were ~£320m, with a profit of ~£2.5m.](http://www.cityam.com/article/car-giant-drives-red-sees-more-models-leave-showrooms) Contrast that to QPR's accounts, and then factor in the 700 locals that Cargiant employs. 

This is interesting news for the club, and I'll be interested to see how they respond. Using QPR to fight this battle appears a little pointless to me - they'd need a serious deployment of resources from ArcelorMittal the and the wider Malaysian investment group. Even then, a compulsory purchase order on a company the size of Cargiant is unrealistic, and you're lining up a 'foreign money trumping locals' narrative that I'm not sure the GLA will want any part of.

I think the redevelopment will end up happening at a pace that our owners cannot dream of pulling off and will look like the outlet mall, hotel and Brent council building at Wembley.

Mr Bun the Baker is probably too busy rustling up goodies for Adel.

>The point of shelling out money - £45 a ticket for this one – to watch Harry Redknapp’s QPR side play away games decreases with each trip. Rangers have played 15 away games since Boxing Day and of those they’ve lost nine and failed to score a goal in 11.

",26,2014-09-20
superhoops,"Just home from the game. 

Defensive concerns. We have to introduce some competition in defence because something looks off between Rio and Caulker. A lot of goals have come from Rio's bad marking -- why not give Onuoha the chance to shake things up a bit? Isla, too, looked a concern today, with both goals coming from his side. 

Ref. Didn't get a proper view nor the benefit of a replay but it definitely looked like Crouch climbed on Rio for their first goal. Ref also let them get away with an unbelievable amount of dirty play in the box. Not to mention the amount of timewasting that he didn't seem to mind in the slightest. Which brings me to the next point.

Stoke. What a bunch of pricks. Dirtiest team I've seen at Loftus Road. Two substitutions used just on injuries. Don't even need to mention the corner defences or the shirt pulling either. Something is seriously wrong with the rules when Shawcross, from behind, can clatter straight into Kranjcar on the turn, and get the same penalty as Fer did when he tried telling Shawcross what's what. 

Goalscoring. Would've loved a goal from open play today: all three goals off set pieces is not a good sign. I gotta say it, Austin sort of looks out of his depth. His first touch is heavy and he loses the ball or doesn't distribute it properly too often. He deserves time to adjust to the Prem but it's not been an auspicious start I don't think. Pleased with Vargas's off-the-ball movement though.

",262,2014-09-20
superhoops,"I thought Phillips was shocking for the most part. He seemed to settle down a bit at the end, but his first touch when receiving a ball coming with any kind of power is woeful. I would've thought Hoilett would've been a wiser choice to compliment the Vargas and Austin partnership. The man can't cross, but when you're playing next to a poacher and a pace merchant his scrappy balls would've sufficed.

The midfield was like a gang of strangers for chunks of the first half. Misplaced passes and seemingly little instinct and confidence in moving the ball into dangerous positions.

I'll forgive Traoré most things as I like his attitude and his workrate is great. He is flawed though, and he gets mugged down his flank. I anticipate a lot of facepalm moments with him over the coming months.

""Let them play"" seems to be the plan. I can't discern any solid tactical strategy any more. It seems to me that the one thing we have in abundance is pace, and we could use more long balls. Too many spells of passing the ball around the box and never finding a decent moment to bank a nice shot. A bit of deja vu from last season, to be honest.

I think St. Charles Austin is a square peg in a round hole. He isn't a battering ram, he isn't a hold-up man, and he isn't a footwork wizard. To me he is a grafter...and I'm not sure he is suitable as the tip of the spear at this level. I'm still not sure what to make of Vargas, but I think I think he is still suffering from lack of matchtime with the rest of the squad.

Two questionably fit players had to be subbed off. I really wish they would take a look at why we keep getting so many soft tissue injuries.

I think Onuoha and Yun are getting screwed over by Redknapp.

Kranjcar hands down man of the match. Superb stuff from him - he just needs to keep it consistent. One of his passes came flying towards my corner of the ground and time almost slowed down as I gazed upon the beautiful spin that characterised the perfect weighting. Still would have been nice to have Taarabt on the bench to cover for him in an emergency though. Hope he recovers soon.

Also have to mention my appreciation of Karl Henry. Non nonsense player, gets on with the job, a clockwork defensive midfielder.

If I was Stoke I would be cursing the string of fouls at the end that gifted us that beautiful goal. With a bit of restraint they could've taken all three points. They had some nasty looking characters among their support. I haven't heard such focus and passion aimed at Sombrero Man before. Then the same characters surprised me by generously applauding the tiger cubs at halftime.

I also didn't see a lot of vitriol aimed at Hughes. There was one bout of ""Stand up, if you hate Mark Hughes"" and two rounds of booing when he got up from his area, but other than that...very little from my end of SAR.",530,2014-09-20
superhoops,"every Ref see's it differently. I know we've seen shirt pulling go either way loads of times. 

thought Niko, was the only player who really looked good the entire 90 minutes! 

Fer looked good also, he just needs more time to learn where everyone is off the ball from him, but that just comes down to gelling and chemistry. 

lucky to get the 1 point today! ",66,2014-09-20
superhoops,AHHH FFS Mutch just tweeted a sad face. Looks like he may be out for a while.,17,2014-09-20
superhoops,"Kranjkar,  Barton and Fer put in shifts today. I hope Barton doesn't have a serious injury.

In the second half there were periods when QPR players looked clueless.  Our passing is often poor and many of of players have problems receiving the ball. 

Traore had a poor game. I still prefer him at left back over Hill though. 

Onuoha needs to be on the pitch. Ferdinand and Caulker aren't good enough.  Our defence had little movement and we're easily beaten. Ferdinand has done nothing to convince me it was a good idea to sign him. 

Also: I spoke to [Dr Alice Roberts](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/67593000/jpg/_67593787_dralicerobertsbbc.jpg) on the train.  She's beautiful.",107,2014-09-20
superhoops,"I agree, poor form by Isla.  Does Onuoha play RB?  If so, I would comfortably slot him in ahead of Isla.  I would much rather that than replacing Ferdinand for Onuoha.  I think, ideally, our best formation is Traore, Ferdinand, Caulker and Onuoha at the back.  It will be interesting to see how Traore handles a top class right wing player.  His attacking qualities and pace are enough for him to remain in the starting XI however I think his style of play was more suited to the 3-5-2.  What do we do on the left wing?  Does Traore come all the way up, or do we play a left midfielder who slots into that attacking left wing role?

In the midfield, I think we stick with five.  Hoilett, Kranjcar, Barton, Fer and Phillips.  Kranjcar is dangerous, we saw that against Stoke and I think we will continue to see that, his fitness alone speaks to his resolve this season.  I don't think we need to justify why Barton deserves a spot, so onto Fer.  This could've really been Mutch or Sandro but I went with Fer because he's been in the starting XI and has looked good.  Phillips makes an appearance on the right wing and I think his pace, size, strength and crossing ability warrant it.  Ultimately he brings width to the team and we need that.  On the left, I put in Hoilett and that is the only area in midfield I wasn't sure about.  Who do we have who provides good width on the left wing, and can deliver a quality cross?  I think Hoilett is the guy, he is nimble and sneaky as well.  The problem is that Traore also overlaps in this role, being someone who likes to come forward and attack.  If Traore is more suited to being our guy on the left wing than maybe we switch out Hoilett for Mutch or someone who is better suited at covering left back when Traore goes forward.

Up front I think we stick with one.  Austin to start and Vargas to sub, but we have to be careful with our strikers as they are in short supply.  I was a tad worried to see both Vargas and Austin on the pitch against Stoke today because if one goes down, we severely hurt our chances going forward.  It is no surprise we are light at striker and for that reason I think we can only afford to stick one up front.",416,2014-09-20

superhoops,"Not a lot to add to that really, decent read. As I occasionally have pointed in various threads elsewhere over the past few months on Burnley, the town doesn't even have a Nando's. Firing off the Sky money on hiring mercenaries would be a waste of precious resources, and I assume the owners agree and they will take the money and run. Wheel out what already works and if the stars are aligned correctly another three other teams might shoot themselves in the foot with enough frequency that they end up with fewer points. Unlikely though - 0-0 results won't get them very far. If I had the patience for a long bet, I'd feel pretty secure in putting money on them going down. They'd at least have some money to refurb their away stand though and ensure that every seat sold is actually a seat, and not a bare concrete step where a seat used to be. I think Trippier will be off too.",165,2014-09-21

It may also be worth attending some of the not so big games,  this will build points and may help in getting tickets first. Please though remeber all games are big games for us. ",60,2014-09-21
superhoops,"I'll probably be travelling to London sometime during this season and would really love to attend a match. 

I've looked at ticket prices from viagogo, mainly for matches against bigger teams, and they are really expensive. I understand that season ticket holders want to monetize on their tickets as they'll probably find people willing to pay the big prices. However, I was wondering how many (if any) tickets to matches vs teams like Man City, Man United, Arsenal, Chelsea make it to general sale? Would it be necessary to purchase a membership first (really hoping that this isn't necessary because I've read that you can only buy 1 ticket per membership)?",111,2014-09-21
superhoops,"So, as far as we're all concerned, any season where we finish 17th or higher is a successful season, right?

Well, with that in mind, I thought I'd have a look at a team we'll probably be competing with for survival this season: Burnley. With five gameweeks gone, I've looked at their games, players, form, playstyle and so on, to try to get a better idea of who it is we're up against. Based on what I saw I've also tried to predict the next five gameweeks (up to Nov 1), to see what kind of results we need to be getting in order to remain above them. 

If you guys enjoy this or find it useful, I'll be happy to write some more profiles on some other teams who'll likely be towards the foot of the table come May. 

**Burnley**

1.	L 1-3 Chelsea (H)

2.	L 0-1 Swansea (A)

3.	D 0-0 Man Utd (H) 

4.	D 0-0 Crystal Palace (A)

5.	D 0-0 Sunderland (H)

6.	West Brom (A)

7.	Leicester (A)

8.	West Ham (H)

9.	Everton (H)

10.	Arsenal (A)

Points: 3

Goals scored: 1 

Goals conceded: 4

Preferred formation: 4-4-2 (sometimes 4-4-1-1)

As of writing, Burnley haven’t scored a goal in more than seven hours of football. For a team that in the Championship depended on their goalscoring (72 goals, 3rd most), this has to be a concern. Their two prolific strikers from that season – Ings and Vokes – are both currently injured, Vokes having missed all season with a serious knee injury and Ings picking up a hamstring against Crystal Palace. Summer-signing Lukas Jutkiewicz is without a goal despite starting every game, but has nevertheless played well and is highly rated amongst the Burnley fans. Scott Arfield, the right-winger, in spite of a poor game against Sunderland, is a real handful, and has been Burnley’s best player so far. 

Burnley’s defence, however, is looking strong, having put up three clean sheets in a row. Their backline – Trippier, Duff, Shackell, Mee – have played consistently together since 2012. As a result the back four, despite having no ‘stars’ or household names, seem congruent, calm and confident. They aren’t what you’d call modern defenders, with adventurous wingers and ‘playing centrebacks’, but they’re quite happy to play deep all game, go narrow when the opposition attacks, and head away crosses all day long. This has worked a treat against teams who opt to play with a lot of long balls (the home draw to United being the most notable), but has been less efficient against teams who like to keep the ball on the ground and play with pace (Swansea and Chelsea).  

In spite of their inauspicious scoring habits and lack of points, Dyche urges calm. With two key strikers missing but the defence nevertheless functioning, the general mood around Burnley is that if they can remain resilient defensively, the points will come once they get some attacking prowess back.

Even though Burnley are pretty much universally considered relegation favourites, they have made a habit of exceeding expectations. Last season their bright start surprised many, and they were widely expected to be unable to keep up the pace due to the narrowness of their squad. But instead, they just kept getting stronger and stronger, and ended up earning automatic promotion comfortably. For that reason I would encourage everyone not to write them off, as they may yet become a team that punches above their weight. 

However, they are currently at a crucial stage of their season. If they start picking up points now, then the awkward start to the season will hardly have mattered; but if they don’t, they will soon find themselves in deep water. Since Everton and Arsenal are tough games to get points from, it’s the next couple of games which will prove most important. West Brom would be their best chance to pick up points, as Leicester and West Ham have both looked very strong. 

All in all, based on what I’ve seen of Burnley, I think it’s probable that they’ll finish their 10th gameweek with 5-8 points.

Points: 4

Goals conceded: 5

Preferred formation: varies widely, but lately 4-1-4-1

It’s hard to know where Sunderland are *at*, as the Americans say, or what exactly to expect from them this year. They've barely kept a consistent formation, were uninspired when we met them at Loftus Road, but at home they have picked up impressive draws against Man Utd and Tottenham. 

Sunderland’s big goal in the transfer window was to pick up a striker. This was meant to be Borini, but as we all know, he would rather keep the bench warm as Liverpool’s 4th-choice striker than move to a team further down the table. 

This has rather landed Sunderland in the soup as they seriously lack firepower up front, and Poyet is left scrambling for a system that compensates for their weak strikeforce. Against WBA he tried playing Fletcher as a lone striker with Connor Wickham supporting from midfield; against Utd and us he played a 4-3-3 with Wickham, Fletcher and Buckley/Johnson; and in the last two games, played Wickham as a lone striker. 

Wickham starting every game might give the impression that he’s been playing well. But really, it’d be more accurate to describe him as the best of a bad bunch. From what I’ve seen, when he has the ball he knows how to lash it, but generally speaking he is stationary and makes very few runs to look for the ball. Big guy, but a bit too soft and easy to push around. Danny Graham hardly looks convincing either, and will most likely be their cup-guy. Fletcher is a little past it, not having looked his previous quality in a fair while now. 

That in mind, I think it’s a safe bet that in January, Sunderland will seek to strengthen. Sunderland are the [22nd highest spending team](http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/wp82_eng.pdf) in the last five years in *all of Europe*, so don’t be surprised if they manage to conjure up another few million to drop on a quality player.

Until then though, Poyet should be grateful to his midfield for picking up the slack. Sunderland’s midfield – usually some combination of Cattermole, Larsson, Rodwell and Johnson –  is their biggest strength: robust and physical, high pass completion rate and retains possession like a mid-table team. Poyet has always been a ‘safety first’ kinda guy, and just as was the case at Brighton, his Sunderland seeks first and foremost to be difficult to break down. Their forward-going threat comes from Johnson’s pace and Larsson’s crosses, as well as set pieces. Van Aanholt, the speedy left-wingback, has also actually been one of their best offensive assets. But with an ineffective striking force, it’s simultaneously alarming and impressive that all five of their goals have come from midfielders. 

Having said all that, aside from the striker situation, this Sunderland team actually looks pretty decent. They have two good goalkeepers in Mannone and Pantilimon and a pretty mean-looking defence. For that reason we should all keep our fingers crossed that Sunderland have very few points once January rolls around and they get a chance to buy a striker. 

However, their fixture list currently looks pretty sympathetic, having already drawn with Tottenham and Man Utd. Their first win of the season probably won't come against Arsenal or Southampton, but Swansea and Stoke at home as well as Crystal Palace away are points available for the taking. Once the 10th gameweek finishes, I’ll expect Sunderland to have between 9 and 11 points.

superhoops,"A disappointing defeat, but did many of us expect to walk away with points?

**Positives:**

* The second half saw real fight from QPR.
* Charlie Austin has scored 2 PL goals in 2 consecutive games.
* Kranjkar has been very impressive in 2 consecutive games - I think he should take all free-kicks that offer a shot at goal.
* Ultimately QPR were beaten by a wonder goal, that few teams could have defended against.
* We played away, against a 2nd placed Southampton, the best team we've met so far this season, and only lost 2-1.


**Negatives**

* We have serious defensive weaknesses.
* Ferdinand looks to be guaranteed a first team start, no mater what.
* Onuoha and Suk-Young will be asking questions about their QPR futures.
* The 4 teams around us have games in hand - We need to start winning games, or soon enough, other teams will start breaking away from us.
* There still looks to be an issue with team cohesion on the pitch, 6 games into the season and after 7 summer training games, there's no excuse for that.


What are your thoughts?

* Think that amazing goal from Charlie will give him a boost such a shame about the Pelle goal 2 minuets later
* Are we to become the man utd retiring home? Where players like Park and Ferdinand they come here to play shit, get talked about how amazing a player they are and just pick up a few final pay packets
* Kranjcar was great again very, positive from him and he looked like if we scored he would be involved in some way
* Green had a very strong 1st half and also rushed out when he realised Ferdinand had fucked up again

I think there are a lot of positives, obviously missing somebody like Barton on the pitch to control the team a bit more and get them going, if we could 
Play like we did in the 2nd half all games it will be a lot more enjoyable to watch and not going they have scored more goals than us we better sit back and defend this one and not attack

There is also a chronic lack of crossing the ball. It's becoming absolutely infuriating.

Karl Henry was a positive for me. His wife's family is QPR so maybe that motivates him a little more.

superhoops,"> He scrapped the 3-5-2 which now sees wing-backs Armand Traore and Mauricio Isla struggle against a direct winger, yet reverting back would see no place for Junior Hoilett who came on to great effect Saturday.

I think our fullbacks and wingers situation is a bit comical really. Pulling out of the plan to use wingbacks has left us playing polo on a pogo stick. I thought we had finally settled the matter of Traoré's identity last season. Here we are six game in wheeling him out as a fullback again. Selling Simpson just looks idiotic - I can only imagine there was some kind of financial logic behind the move. Probably to free up funds for one of Redknapp's schemes to bring in another old boy (Diarra? Defoe? Crouch?). On the positive side, at least Traoré and Isla try, in spite of any technical weaknesses.

If we were still playing with the three in the middle I could live with Ferdinand, but all his wily experience and knowledge just isn't compensating his physical limitations in my eyes and this partnership with Caulker just doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. To be honest I'm not sure Onuoha would suddenly transform us into a concrete wall at the back, but at least he's been here a while, would presumably stick around given playing time and is liked by the people who cheer him on on matchday.

If we want to avoid relegation, we need to be exciting and daring.  We need to take points in fixtures we aren't supposed to.  It just cant happen with Harry in charge.  He's too sentimental and stubborn.  With managers like Pulis and Sherwood out there, I think now is the time.  Liverpool, Chelsea, and City are coming up.

Its the same old response. ""Players unfit, Poor Pre-Season, Remy leaving last minute"". We have the players, we have the money, we don't have the determination or a solid starting 11. The more we mention Pulis, the more i like him. We have a better squad on paper than Palace, and if Pulis has the ability to blend and gel with the team, then we have a really good opportunity to survive. 

Harry won't leave. Rio won't be out of the squad. We will not have a final starting 11 with a final formation. That is just how the season is going to pan out because realistically i don't see Harry leaving.",113,2014-10-05

We've got a tough run of fixtures coming up so have to accept that it's likely we'll be bottom at Xmas whoever is in charge. If Redknapp is still in at the helm he'll get Defoe in January, plus one or two others - if there's one thing he's good at it's bringing in players. So if we don't replace him now we're realistically talking about either sacking him in about March time and hoping for a miracle, or sticking with him as we did last time and hoping he can get us back up again.

Clearly the preferable option is to act immediately, at the beginning of this 2 week break, and install Pulis. No team should be relying on January transfers, in my opinion, and our squad, despite obvious weaknesses, is strong enough to survive.",138,2014-10-05

superhoops,"To be honest for me it isn't early days. Fair enough there has been a lot of coming and going since the last relegation but the last time I felt positive about Harry was in the wake of the Onyewu signing (who we ended up never using). I thought he was building an interesting squad within a budget set by our owners.

Then from that first loss at Burnley onwards it just looked like it wasn't coming together. We could defend well enough, but the squad looked clueless going on the attack. Our post-xmas form was mediocre, and if it wasn't for the points from that 10 game undefeated streak I don't think we would've even made top 6. Every game he wheeled out a different squad. The ponderous passing around the box never ended. BAE kept his spot long after he should've been benched. Endless injuries raised questions about fitness.

The playoffs are a lottery and our number came up.

A summer later and boom - new cast, same shit. Higher level means we won't get away with it like last season. No instinct, no intensity, shoddy and inconsistent tactics. We've ground out two acceptable performances so far (Hull and Sunderland). Lucky against Stoke. Why the fuck did he sell Simpson? Why was he willing to let go of Traoré, leaving us with Hill as the only LB (as he clearly doesn't like the crunch on Yun's biscuits)? Why did he spend millions building for a 3-5-2, only to drop it a few games into the season? The players don't like it? You're their fucking boss. Make them like it.

In the three windows with us he's found a few of his old boys to bring in, and if still here in January expect more. I don't deny that a lot of players seem to enjoy life under his regime. However I suspect this might be because he simply doesn't hassle them. Everyone loves a boss who isn't always hassling you.

superhoops,"I said give it 10 games into the season before the start, but with Chelsea, Man City and Liverpool coming up it's highly unlikely that we will be out of the bottom 3 after that period.

To me it seems a combination of poor starts, disinterested players and manager. I know if you come up, you can't expect to be top half after this time, but it's the way we are losing that seems so familiar to 2 years ago.

If I were cynical, I would get Harry out and try and get Pulis, but I can't see that happening with Fernandes' backing. Harry needs to have a fully formed plan going into games rather than the 11 players who seemed to do alright last week and the players need to start showing they want to be there.

I think we're missing players like Barton and carrying players like Ferdinand. I just hope our good record against top clubs from the year we stayed up gives us a boost. Until then, I think we need to give a good account of ourselves in these 3 big games otherwise I can see history repeating itself.

Fernandes should be the most furious of all. It's his funding, and the funding of people he's responsible to on some level. His little rant fails to address the insanity of selling Simpson and spending money on a beefy midfield and Isla to set up a system we ditched almost immediately.

Adel also looked pretty handy when he came on, albeit for a Zamora-style time limited appearance due to physical limitations. If I'm the man with the money, I'd be asking why one of our obviously sharpest assets isn't being used, and why more isn't being done to ready it for deployment.

I look forward to plan Q being rolled out against Liverpool. Maybe Richard Dunne can make a reappearance? Sub Hoilett out at 25 mins for SWP? Matty Phillips as a rightback?

superhoops,">“I have no intention of walking away, not a chance. I’ve not even considered it.""

Well that's not a surprise, Harold. You're on a pretty penny at QPR and being an active Premier League manager breathes life into other facets of your life in the public eye.

>I’ve seen it all before. But my commitment to the job hasn’t changed and I believe when everyone is fit results will start to turn.

Even if you are committed to the job - and I'll point to your comments about retirement and golf - what do you understand the job to be, especially beyond throwing out 11 men every weekend and ringing around your old agent mates each transfer window? I'll reference the point made on the last podcast - Pulis at the end of last season stalking the club's facilities, pointing out which minutiae he wanted changed. If Redknapp is doing the same, I'm Modibo Maiga's pizza delivery guy.

>“If it’s not [Newcastle manager] Alan Pardew with one game to save his job, it’s me. Perhaps people don’t have anything better to write about.

Well...Pardew has a long contract that will be expensive to buy out. And QPR supporters are generally pretty invested in terms of time and money in supporting the club. I'm sure they could write about better things on the forums and Twitter (""What's your favourite KFC Krushem?"") but the online reaction isn't exactly whimsical tip-tapping on the keyboard on a Sunday afternoon.

>When we went to Ireland on a pre-season tour we only had 12 outfield players.

12 players? Hmmmmm.

> I get fed up some days having to drive from home at 5am in the morning and getting criticised but I enjoy football too much to think about walking away.

His enjoyment of 'football' would probably be better served as a full-time pundit.

>“I had no interest in signing one either. I said to Tony Fernandes that if we stay in the Premier League then let’s sit down and have a discussion....I wouldn’t have any interest managing in the Championship""

Again with his conditions. Some might interpret this as him only staying if he swerves failure. Others...that he will only bother waking up at 5am to drive up if it's to a Premier League club.

Side note, last season Crystal Palace only picked up 3 points from their first 10 league matches. Their only win was a 3-1 home victory against Sunderland in week 3. They ended up finishing 11th in the table so there is hope QPR could turn it around.

After Vargas' two goals last week the thought must have crossed Redknapp's mind to drop Charlie and play Vargas up front with Bobby - a classic Harry little-n-large. But he got it spot on, as evidenced by Vargas setting up Charlie's 2nd.

He also got the Hoilett substitution exactly right. At a time when we couldn't keep control of the ball and Henry and Sandro weren't having enough influence in the middle, I didn't know if putting on a winger who often wastes the ball was a wise move. But as soon as he came on he provided a great outlet, made us much wider, and nearly scored himself.

* **Isla:** Big improvement from his early games. Great sliding tackles and excellent commitment.

* **Zamora:** For 2 games now, he's dominated the opposition box and looked supremely confident.

* **Austin:** Just as some pundits were writing him off. Excellent finishes.

* **Dunne:** He keeps it simple and was very reliable today, providing an excellent clearance service.

* **Green:** Great double save. Good communication with the back line.

* **Suk-Young:** I love seeing him do well. Non-stop commitment, excellent attitude and a great investment for the future of QPR.

superhoops,"Not to take away anything from a great win, but i thought we looked a little weak offensively in the midfield.  Fer, Sandro, and Henry are great athletes and defenders, but we lacked some creativity there.  Because the plan was to lump the ball forward to Zamora (which I loved) we didnt need them to do much offensively, but I did think we struggled to go through the midfield when we tried to.  Maybe Barton will help that?

Anyway, great win.  Yun and Isla looked awesome, Dunne was a rock, the midfield worked so hard, and Austin, Vargas, and Zamora looked dangerous.  Onwards and upwards you R's",107,2014-10-27
superhoops,"Exhausted.

Yun - pleased he seems to be the real deal.

Austin - goalscorer, definitely benefits from  having a partner in Zamora, who I still maintain we need to replace with a younger model good for 90 minutes as soon a viable one is identified.

Vargas - pace and effort. Looks to be the type of threat we've been starved of for ages.

Isla - finally looking settled and combines well with Vargas.

Sandro and Henry - happy with these two. Karl Henry continues to be an honest pro.

Fer - for me, better in the middle.

Dunne - outshining Ferdinand already. So reliable in the air.

Hoilett - still provides one of the most exciting outlets late in games, when a player finds those long diagonal cross-pitch passes that he runs onto.

Overall I'm very thankful they strung together two performances like that, and we looked Premier League quality.

Pleased about the win, missed the last two games as I was out the country. Need to keep up the high pressure game. Hoping for a point from the next two! ",60,2014-10-27
superhoops,"Good result but important not to get ahead of ourselves. For most of the game we were second best. It's easy to view the game with rose-tinted glasses because of the last 20 minutes but in the first half we had pretty much one good chance, which we thankfully scored. Once we got the 2-0 we went on cruise control, but more because AV seemed to give up than anything else.

Fer, Sandro and Henry were class against Liverpool. Really bossed the midfield. At least in the first half. In the second, we subbed off Onuoha due to injury and changed to 4-4-2. That was when Liverpool started taking over. For some reason this team doesn't seem to be very good at 4-4-2. I think we saw that today as well. Fer, Sandro and Henry could hardly complete a 10 yard pass in the first half. And Fer does *not* belong on the left. Kept drifting inwards towards the centre of midfield and left acres of space behind him which AV exploited again and again. Another reason we were lucky today because a better team would've made us pay for that. However, once we brought Hoilett on and went 4-5-1, and let Fer play through the middle, suddenly we were bossing. In other words, we need to persist with the 3-5-2 experiment as soon as Onuoha comes back.

MOTM for me was Yun Suk Young. How long has he been in our squad without starting again? Today he was full of energy, had great workrate, great positioning, great intelligence. If he keeps this up he'll begin to rival Onuoha for my favourite QPR player.

I also want to point out that this game was like the inverse of how QPR games so far this season have tended to play out. Usually our midfield is pretty good but our defence leaks a goal or two; our strikers are inefficient, waste a few chances and we end up losing 1-0 or 2-1 or something. But today, in spite of misplaced passes in midfield, our attack was clinical and our defence was watertight. That's good enough against Villa but if we're going to get anything against Chelsea and City we'll need everything working.",370,2014-10-27

superhoops,"After the last two performances, I can't wait. We'll be tucked away in [the corner in the left](http://www.footballgroundguide.com/chelsea/shed-end-stamford-bridge.jpg).

Apparently Zamora and John Terry are fishing buddies. Being mates, that might give Bobby the nonchalance to really get stuck into physical battles, leaving the noble Englishmen Austin and Cahill to duel it out themselves.

The midfield worries me a little bit here. They can throw so much at us, and we will need absolutely robotic performances from whoever starts from Henry, Barton and Sandro to neutralise them. Not sure where this leaves our distribution to be honest, other than Barton's long balls.

I wouldn't mind seeing a solid bus parking strategy here. A 5 man back line? Variation of the 3-5-2, with the wingbacks playing very conservatively?

Harry must have a proper selection headache on this one. Some of our best performers from the last two games are going to have to settle for bench roles. Maybe play it defensively for the first 70, and if we're hanging on, play a wildcard pace player who might nick something?

Vargas, Hoilett and Yun being on the pitch might draw them into fouls. Those dead ball situations might bag us a sneaky goal.

So if I was dicking around on Football Manager, I'd go with a backline of Dunne in between Caulker and Onuoha, with Yun and Isla as fullbacks. A four man midfield, Sandro and Barton in the middle with Vargas and Hoilett on the wings. Austin as the lone striker - with instructions to not drop too deep and wait on breaks from the wings. I love that he is willing to drop back to put in a defensive shift, but maybe for this one he should gamble with focusing on trying to nick a goal.

We've sold out the away section, and it will probably be more useful if the energy is directed towards positive feedback for the players rather than bollocks at the Chelsea crowd, Terry and Remy. Unless it all goes 4-0 again. In which case you make your own entertainment, eh?

If it does slip into a lost cause, maybe it'd be a good time to throw Taarabt into the mix.",364,2014-10-29
superhoops,"Last time Taarabt was up front on his own. It was inspired, he held the ball up and drew fouls all night. It'll have to be Bobby performing that role, and since Charlie is undroppable their partnership will have to work really well. In order for that to happen, we need to be playing a high line, because if our defence is clearing the ball from deep and Bobby is fighting for the ball on the half-way line only to lay it off to Charlie around the centre circle, it's not much use. Really we want Bobby fighting for it on the edge of the box, where he can tee Charlie up to finish. But that's tricky if they've got Costa up front looking to get round the back of Richard Dunne. It'll be far easier if they've got Drogba up front. Then we can play the high line and pack the space in front of the defence with Henry, Fer and Sandro, and just chase chase chase like our lives depend on it. When we win it back, straight to Bobby, to Charlie, to goal. Then, when we're defending a 1-0 lead and they throw on Costa, we remove Bobby/Charlie and put hoilett on, then drop deeper. At that stage the hold up man will be playing in the centre circle, but that's fine if he has Vargas and Hoilett running off him.

On Saturday we'll need a brilliant performance from our central midfield - Sandro and Henry will need to step their game up from last weekend. ",259,2014-10-29
superhoops,"Kick-off: Saturday 3pm @ Stamford Bridge.

Last time we played them at the Bridge I went there expecting we'd do well to only get beaten 4-0 - we hadn't won an away game since they started making the ball round.

With a great strike from SWP and outstanding defensive performance from Onuoha, Derry, Hill and Nelsen, [we went on to win 0-1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20843072).

Just as few players from our 1-0 win over Chelsea were in the team, this Saturday we will field few from our win at Stamford Bridge.

Will Harry field a defensive line-up, that's designed to score on the break? - not a formation we've been used to this season. I'm not sure we even have the players for that.

Diego Costa and Ramires are reportedly back from injury and will be played on Saturday. I'd expect them to be subbed on. If we're going to face those players, now is a good time.

It's a Derby game and, due to our recent history, it's a game where anything can happen. The biggest thing in Chelsea's favour is Mourinho, he has a personality for high-pressure games and you'd expect he'll be well-prepared for Saturday. In addition Chelsea have invested in some very high quality players.

We are growing as a team, which is the most important factor. Our players seem to understand the importance of Saturday's game to the fans, there is a need to keep improving and there has been conversation among our defensive players about 'doing what it takes', implying the potential for employing 'dirty play' when required - I like to think we'll get something from this game.",272,2014-10-29

superhoops,"The last time my voice was this ruined was after the Derby game. £57 be damned, I had an absolute ball and we really stuck it to the Chelsea fans. Who didn't sing the entire game, btw, and [even their manager is giving them shit for it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29867892). When they scored the 2-1 goal they didn't even have the decency to mock us back. Arrogant, uninvolved 'fans'. 

Well, file this one under ""games we deserved more from"", right alongside Hull and Liverpool. If it had been *any* other team in the league, we'd have got a point or better from that game. There's been a lot of talk about whether it was a penalty or not, but I'm going to say that I think it was, if only because I'd like to continue to believe that David Luis's foul on Heidar in *that* game was a penalty as well. 

Dunne absolutely ate Costa alive the entire game, and Caulker looks far more confident at his side. Yun looked good, as always, but Isla gave the ball away cheaply a few times too many. Nevertheless that's the back-four we should persist with. In central midfield we were, unsurprisingly, second best, with Henry looking particularly out of his depth. We really could've benefited from having Barton that game. He's not afraid of a strong tackle and we could've used his ability to find open area on the pitch. 

Starting Hoilett was a mistake that I think Redknapp has to take responsibility for. Hoilett is good against teams that are the same quality or worse. But his one-dimensional run-at-the-defender game was never going to work against Ivanovic. Also he didn't track back nearly enough and against top opposition that's an unforgivable sin. Again, Zamora came on and we scored 2 minutes later. Coincidence? 

But, onwards. If we play like this we will surely give City problems. The fans were immense and will carry over that energy to the next game. We may not have got any points, but if nothing else, we've taken confidence and a sense of our own ability from that game.",350,2014-11-01

Chelsea's 2 goals were down to chances provided by mistakes by 2 of our younger newer players (Yun and Vargas), admittedly likely due to Chelsea pressure. We will continue to improve.

superhoops,"I think we can, but I am anticipating it going quite deep into the season before safety is assured.

We need to address the rightback issue in January and free up Isla to play on the right side of midfield, and I'll say again - we should look to replicate what is working for us by finding a 90 minute Bobby Zamora from somewhere. I'd prioritise this over Defoe or Crouch.

After the international break we have a nice, long run of games where we shouldn't be hanging back looking to bounce away attacks like pinball flippers against the likes of Chelsea and Man City. We need to look at cushioning that god awful goal difference.

I think Burnley are almost certainly going straight back down to feat on their riches in the Championship. Only having to leapfrog two teams might be a rare luxury. However I'm guessing these two are coming from the current Sunderland - Stoke group. I can't imagine us comfortably pulling away from any of them, but we'll see.

As long as they put in the same effort we've seen over the last few matches, I won't complain. Relegation will bring in its own fresh soap opera delights, with fines and court cases and half the team disappearing.",212,2014-11-03
superhoops,"We have, coming up, a relatively generous string of fixtures. From these games we not only *can* take points, but absolutely *must*. These games are, I think, where our season is decided. If we get enough points there, and restore ourselves to the 1:1 games:points ratio that marks the bare minimum of what you need to stay in the PL, then I think we'll go on to stay up. If not, I think we'll get relegated.

The reason I think these games are so important is not necessarily purely the points (we actually have some kind fixtures in the beginning of 2015), but rather because of momentum. There seems to be a kind of magnifying effect hovering over this club. Whatever happens, it happens for us 10x more intensely. 

When it goes bad for us, it goes *bad*. Memories of past failures, the woeful state of our club in 2012, Bosingwa-gate, desperate failed signings -- it all comes flooding back. Calls for the manager to resign. Accusations that the chairman is incompetent. Claims that the players don't care and are only in it for the paycheque. If we go into January with the club in that state, we won't recover.

However, we are currently in the opposite condition. We've played well three games now and the feeling around the team and the supporters is resurgent and positive. All of a sudden everyone believes. But if we lose to City and lose to Newcastle away -- which is, let's face it, the likely outcome -- we'll be at 12 games played with 7 points to show for it. If we don't restore ourselves to the 1:1 benchmark immediately afterwards, I fear the downwards spiral will start again. And it'll be deja vu for the rest of the season. That familiar sinking feeling all the way down to the Championship.",308,2014-11-03

As of the past 3 games we have shown the necessary character and willingness to defend that I think only teams that stay up possess. 

However, we must stay healthy and by ""we"" I mean Charlie Austin. Additionally, no ones really talking about it that much but Zamora has been huge. Nothing fancy except for hard work and amazing hold up play.

Can we stay UP ? We need roughly 37 points (as is the benchmark from previous seasons).

I was disappointed in how we started the season (as I wanted to avoid being in the relegation zone for any period of time) but I have been impressed in recent weeks with our displays against top teams (Liverpool and Chelsea *who are going to win the league most likely by a 20 point gap come the end of the season*).

My vote is YES. But obviously we need to avoid injuries and get a decent striker come January - Not that Charlie isn't finding his feet but we need a backup other than Vargas. (I hope Defoe is still on the cards).

ALSO; REDKNAPP needs to stay. Regardless if we have a bad run of games. The teams that do the best stick with their management long-term (look at Fulham last season for example).

Here are the teams we potentially can beat (or at least pick up points) IMO (or have a chance too):

West Ham x 1
Swansea x 2 
West Brom x 2
Newcastle x 2
Stoke x 2
Hull x 1
Villa (again) x 1
Palace x 2
Sunderland (again) x 1
Leicester x 2
Burnley x 2

(probably about 50 points in there somewhere).

I think we could shock one or two of the big teams with a draw or a 90min winning goal as well but nothing to bank on.

Obviously we will have to get most points from Home but I'm not feeling as negative about this season as the last Premier League season we were involved in.

My fandom went from being pretty casual to more intense as I went out and bought FIFA the past couple seasons, this has helped me get to know who is on the team and what not. For Christmas I am asking for some QPR ""swag"" and I am totally hooked now on this team.

The difference from last season is pretty extreme I feel - we took a bit of a verbal pummeling from some visiting supporters, but I think we'll deliver back this year and I can't wait for Leicester and Burnley to come back to W12. I think the players are feeling it too - if the volume is going to suddenly spike due to a skillful/courageous piece of play, that must spur them on.

I think the lineups are helping things too - you've got the solid professionals like Dunne, Henry and a reinvented Barton. You've got exciting players who bring a fantastic work-rate like Yun and the two Chileans. I think the fact that Caulker started every game in the PL last year counts for quite a lot in terms of matchday experience. The cherry on top is Austin - I think we could at least double our money on him now. 

There were too many faces that didn't sit too well with me last year - BAE, Morrison, Benayoun, Maiga...maybe even Doyle and LTC. I don't get the feeling this year. I don't want Rio back in the squad, and I think his salary could be much better spent elsewhere, and of course there's SWP. However other than those two I'm pretty content with the team.

I think Faurlin's injury is an extra bitter pill to swallow in light of how well Isla and Vargas are doing. I suspect he could have worked so well with those two and helped them settle in even more.",276,2014-11-10

Remember that QPR isn't really a popular destination - you'll be one of the few tourists (and you're very welcome) - so most of the people around either live there or are returning to their manor.

Personally speaking, it's funny how fragile all that positivity was that I snowballed from that 4 game window. Palace's victory put a very different perspective on the Liverpool game, and I was really hoping that the polish from the other games would produce something on Saturday. Our next two away games will likely be just as difficult - Swansea and Everton.

Funny reactions to Schmeichels time-wasting/rushing. I thought our performance wasn't brilliant. Too many stray passes, majority coming from Barton. Caulker also had a decent game.

Couldn't trust Onuoha all game. To be fair to him he's just come back and needs a few games to really slot in at the back but I thought we'd be fine without Dunne today. This game showed just how much we missed him. Breakdowns in communication at the back were responsible for a lot of Leicesters chances. To be fair to them they played really well and were always a danger.

Green had a decent game, it's strange feeling so confident with him in goal and seeing him so confident at the back. Caulker was the better of the two CBs but again, a more clinical team would have punished us for those mistakes. Isla was great again for me.

Really impressed with Krancjar and Fer. We played the game with so much intensity that we were always taking a risk with the result but it feels so good to have chalked up another 3 points. Let's hope the boys go to Swansea with some confidence! We can take something from there!",177,2014-11-29
superhoops,"Massive, massive win. Hopefully we can kick on from here and string some results together.

The positives: We won. Great to see us score goals and cause problems without BZ. Fer played well - he looks much more comfortable playing centrally rather than wide. Good to see Onuoha get a start at CB. 

The negatives: We look to hit Charlie/Leroy far too much with long balls. Our midfield seem largely to be there to fight for second balls. Defence still looks fragile but fragile and quick rather than fragile and slow. The injury to Yun.",95,2014-11-29

Nice to see Fer get a goal, should really help boost his confidence.  Also nice to see Mutch get back on the pitch.

Too much bickering between players early on in the match for my liking.

I had four Leicester fans sitting next to me. One was dopey enough to momentarily jump up and cheer when they equalised for 2-2. Silly boy. Some of the old guard marched on him, spat on him and the Leicester quartet were slung out for their troubles, missing the goal that robbed them of all three points.

Not cool at all about Yun though, that looked painful. Traoré doesn't convince me as cover.",111,2014-11-29
superhoops,"With Dunne suspended, our defence was always likely to be shaky. There's now a consistency to our players, they need a few games to settle in. Barton is an example of this, with some poor passing and regular off-target shots into row Z. Fortunately we were able to score more than we let in.

For me, it wasn't a pleasant game to watch. QPR fans were very quiet, I think we expected to beat Leicester. There was a feeling that after recent performances, we were due 3 points, so it wasn't until late in the game that the crowd got going. When we looked in danger of not winning our players came back concentrated and ruthless, quickly scoring. When that happens I ask myself why we don't do that all the way through the game.

With all due respect to Leicester, they looked like a good quality Championship side, with little individual skill, relying on the counter-attack and our very poor defence; but they are a team we have to beat to stand a chance of staying in this league.

Excellent energy levels from QPR players and great to see a very attacking team, not something we've been used to for many years - 37 shots yesterday (6 on target) - and that was without BZ.

Traoré: Not someone we see play very often. He's another player that needs games. Sitting in X block I had a close view of his performance. His ability to put in a cross is quite amazing. He puts in crosses crosses from seemingly nothing, as he's squeezed into the sideline with no space. I think his crossing ability should be used more often.

superhoops,"I no longer feel nervous about how we will perform. It's 55/45 in favour of us staying up this season. If we go down, it's not a disaster; we have good practice of relegation and the club is in better shape than in 2012/13, and in fact in the best shape for the past 20 years.

As the team continues to settle, I expect to see an on-going improvement in performances. If that prediction turns out to be true, we'll stay up, with a solid base to slowly build on.

So long as I can go to Loftus road and enjoy watching our football, win or lose, I'll be happy.

---------------------------

In terms of the next game: With Dunne back in the squad we should expect to see an improved defensive performance. Our last game showed we have options for attack. The players should go into the game feeling cautiously confident that if they put in the effort they can get a result.",163,2014-12-01
superhoops,"I don't anticipate calm nerves any time soon. Saturday was really stressful to be honest. I'm glad they took the three points though, as it will lessen the burden of getting a result tomorrow (although if we get thumped like Swansea have done to us before a few times in recent years...that's a different matter).

That said, we have to break this tradition of losing away at some point, and we can't leave it too late in the day. We need to be far more willing to enter into a firefight rather than invite pressure against the likes of Swansea. For the most part I think the squad largely lack the finesse to operate entirely effectively on the counter - it's a real ballache because you'd imagine that Traoré, Phillips and Hoilett are perfect for that, but I think each of them is technically unreliable for either holding it up at the end of a run,waiting for the others to scramble into play, or for finding that one touch shot to find the back of the net. That being the case we will need to scheme our way up the field or failing that use blunt force - Henry, Barton and Fer (centrally, for god's sake) swapping in Mutch should be capable of this.

As much as I think all of the home games between now and new year are winnable, it wouldn't surprise me to see us drop them. The only team we have beaten 'comfortably' is Aston Villa, Austin has scored as many goals as their entire team so far. I'm not sure we will experience many instances of us battering a team into second place this year. I think Caulker is a rock, but I have pretty grounded expectations of the rest of the cast at the back (including Dunne, regardless of his supreme efforts so far).

It's a very nice twist of fate that we're being served up so many six pointers in such a short space of time though. By the time we're heading to the Emirates on boxing day the club could be pulling away quite nicely from the bottom three. Once the confidence levels are up, and they loan in Defoe and whoever else to boost the squad, who knows what could happen?",380,2014-12-01

superhoops,"Next 3 home games are going to be vital (Burnley, West Brom &amp; Crystal Palace) Obviously we don't want to give away points to fellow strugglers but I think we can reduce their importance by improving away form (and there is nowhere to go but up). 

We are on 11 points (on just home form as things stand today - 01.12.14 we are 7th in the league) at the moment.Our away fixtures have also been very difficult at the start of the season: Spurs, Man Utd, Southampton (who we gave a run for their money), West Ham, Chelsea (Ditto like the saints) &amp; Newcastle have been tough as old boots. All bang in form teams (except for Spurs) and apart from Man City/Arsenal probably the best the league has to offer. 

I don't see it as impossible that we could get something from Swansea, Everton or Arsenal. Both Everton (Leicester) and Arsenal (Hull &amp; Leicester) have slipped up this season against teams like us and therefore we could pick up a few points.

After the Christmas period is over we have a string of quite average teams to play away, starting with Burnley,Stoke &amp; Sunderland and only occasionally coming across a top 7 side.

So what I'm trying to say is the Christmas period is very important (for points but also for who will come into the team in January and moral) but I think just as important is improving away form. 

If we can maintain home form, away form will be the decider of whether we stay in this league or are relegated. We have got all our points from home games this season and if we had drawn even two of those games instead of losing them we join 13th (on points) now and in the media's eyes that's a million miles away from 18th. 

Really to be on track by the new year we need to be on about 19 (round about half of 40 points, ie probably safe). So out of 6 games we've got to get 7 points.

TLDR: Our away form isn't as bad as it looks, all our away games have been against in-form teams (top 7). If we can improve this Christmas/and afterwards will look a lot easier. ",376,2014-12-01

______________________________________
Food for thought...

All 11 points have so far come from home games. That's a rate of 1.6 points per home game. We have 12 home games remaining. So we may expect to get (1.6 x 12 =)  19 points from the remaining home games, giving us (19 +11 =) 30 points. Meaning **we need to get a further 5 points from away games**. Where will those 5 away points come from?

Alternatively..

The more astute among you may already have noticed our home form has improved in recent weeks. In fact the past 4 home games (since our post-West Ham awakening) have earned us 7 points = 1.8 points per game. If we continue that home form, our remaining home games would earn us (12 x 1.8 =) 22 points. Leaving **just 2 away points needed for PL survival**.

______________________________________

**In conclusion**

To stay in the Premier league, we need to:

* Maintain our home form

* Win 2 away games

Take 7 points from our next three home games and I'll be a very happy bunny indeed.

I'd rather look at the relegation dogfight by surveying the rivals for the drop though. I think Leicester and Burnley are most likely to drop, but then you have to take your pick from Palace, West Brom, Hull and Sunderland. That being the case, I think the results from the coming games against Palace and West Brom are vital. Thank god they both lost (at home) last night.

After 12 years of waking up at 7 a.m. on the weekend to follow on television, I finally had the pleasure of going to Loftus Road for QPR vs. Leicester City last weekend. Most of my friends wondered why I didn't choose a bigger venue like the Emirates or Stamford Bridge. But I wanted to see a real club in a real ground. The experience at Loftus Road did not disappoint. 

All the Rs supporters were so nice to my family and I, and the experience was so refreshing compared to the corporatized experience of American sports venues. 

We happened to be sitting right below the traveling Leicester City supporters, who were riding high after the first goal from Cambiasso. Full credit to them for the ""You're SHIT .... Haaaaaa!"" chant every time Greeno hoofed the ball down the field.

Again, you got a good game for this - the biggest teams to visit us this season, Liverpool and Man City, have brought the dullest fans. Leicester have been knocking around the second tier for long enough that they are used to sparring with a different class of supporter.

It was fantastic - everything worked out perfectly: flight landed early, got to hotel and then out to Loftus Road with plenty of time to get a pint at the Springbok. Got into our seats in time to see warmups and make a few pregame obscene gestures to the Leicester fans sitting 30 or 40 feet away.

>And we really enjoyed the game - thought it was a bit sloppy all around, but exciting nonetheless. The rhythm of the scoring - Leicester going up, then QPR matching, and on - made for a great up-and-down ride and lots of good chanting back and forth.

But at home, we've been winning all the games we have to win. And those away points are coming. The second half of the season makes great reading for us.

It's hard not to look back on those dropped points against Hull and Liverpool with regret, but we've really moved on since then. Another great performance again today, not entirely convincing but solid enough (had Green to thank for a great first half save, but even in spite of his great shot stopping he still makes me so nervous when he's got the ball because of his proneness to errors, he cleared a ball straight to Boyd (?) in the first half and almost gave Burnley the lead when he came to collect a cross).

Barton was great, Henry was very decent as well today, he's really growing on me. Krancjar was absolutely essential when he came on, he controlled the midfield and calmed the game down. Dunne, typically superb. A sensational CB, can't think of many better at 35, always steals the limelight from Caulker who was effective as well today. The full backs were excellent, Vargas had another quiet game, but we all know what he's capable of producing.

Does anybody else think Austin's red might not be too unfortunate an occurrence for the Everton game? We've been so ineffective away using the home set-up, so maybe a front two of Zamora and Vargas might offer us a different dynamic going forward. Krancjar should start as well.

***Hull***

After their cup heroics, I was surprised to see them enter the relegation zone but I have looked up their performances only 2 wins this season (which is quite bad for this time in the season). It's unfortunate that sports media seems to have a narrative they like to see and it's why IMO Hull haven't even been mentioned as relegation contenders by outlets like MOTD.

Hull have got a difficult run in; Chelsea **A** (lose IMO), Swansea **H** (lose IMO), Sunderland **A**  (either way) &amp; Leicester **H** (either way). They could come into January with not much more points than they have now.

My prediction: **3 points** from the next 4 games.

***Sunderland***

In a decent position they have West Ham **H**  (lose IMO), Newcastle  **A**  (Lose as it is a Debry and Newcastle are at home), then Hull (either way)**H**  and Villa (either way) **A**. I would think with Gus they should be okay. They have 2 relegation six-pointers of their own but if I was a betting man I would go for Sunderland. 

My prediction: **3 points** from the next 4 games.

***Crystal Palace***

Looking to me like the strongest out of the bunch. Stoke **H** (either way) Man City **A** (lost) Southampton **H** (lose IMO) QPR **A** (QPR win IMO). Hard games all, but they surprised everyone last year. Warnock has been doing okay so far but apart from the Liverpool game nothing special.

My Prediction: **4 points** from the next 4 games.

***West Bromwich Albion***

Another Team I'm surprised to see around us. Villa **H** (either way) QPR **A** (hopefully QPR) Man City **H** (lost) Stoke **A** (either way). Hard to predict them. A lot rides on what happens when we play them I think. Will decide whether they just romp on through to 2015 or get caught up in the battle.

My prediction: **4 points** from the next 4 games.

***Leicester City***

Very hard Christmas; coming into these games without a win since September, which is why it was so important that we beat them. I wouldn't like the look of any of these games. Man City **A** (lose) West Ham **H** (lose) Tottenham **A** (lose IMO) Hull **A** (either way). If Leicester aren't careful they could be cut adrift from the rest of the league by January.

My prediction: **1 point** from the next 4 games.

***Burnley***

Now that is a Christmas run in you don't want. Southampton **H** (lose) Tottenham **A** (lose) Liverpool **H**(lose) Man City **A** (lose)
Burnley are the draw masters of the league so far but I can't imagine them picking up point from these teams. Southampton will be looking for a win after last week. Maybe an out of form Tottenham but I think Palace was a blip. Liverpool no way and City. Like Leicester they have got a run in that'd frighten any manager. We stopped a 3 game undefeated run that might have got them through to January with their heads held high but I can't see where they will be getting points from now.

My prediction: **0 points** from the next 4 games.

***Queens Park Rangers***

Everton **A** (probably lose) West Brom **H** (either way) Arsenal **A** (probably lose) Crystal Palace **H** (either way). From my perspective I can see us getting something from those away games... maybe a point. Everton have got us after a mid-week Europa league game and Arsenal aren't in sparkling form at the moment. Hopefully we can avoid losing both of those home games but our luck will run out somewhere we may lose one of them.

My prediction: **4 points** from the next 4 games. Which would leave us at 18 coming into the next year. Which would be an okay position.


**Comments**

It is interesting to see that Leicester and Burnley have such tough run ins. If we can avoid losing to West Brom and Palace then things might be looking nice by January. I don't imagine many of the teams around us (barring a good run of form) will be coming out of Christmas with more than 17 points.

That being said, I can't see us maintaining our home form to January without even the slightest blip not matter how many virgins I sacrifice. Rob Green can't keep on saving the day like his alter-ego is Clark Kent. This is why our away form frustrates me so much. With a few away draws we would be several places above now and in a completely different mind-set.

There are a few other teams that could join this group. Even reaching as far as 11th place Aston Villa. I can see what Harry meant by Home-form being vital this Christmas. 

EDIT: One of the points I've forgotten to mention is although our away form is terrible. We have a lot more wins on the board than the teams around us and I think that the experience of regular wins is vital.",840,2014-12-08

superhoops,"Another option would be to acquire a good right-winger to allow Vargas to play up front, when needed. That is Vargas' natural position. 


I would put serious money on Vargas scoring more goals than Keane. Vargas is well settled into the club and has scored when played up front for QPR and scores plenty of goals for his national side in that position.

Another option would be to acquire a decent right-back, allowing Isla to play in his natural right-wing position, then allowing Vargas to play up-front.... that way you have two quality young players, who have a natural pairing playing in their naturally strongest positions - As this is a logical and natural thing to do I bet Harry will do all in his power to prevent it from happening, until he has no choice.

I hope we'll get a point against Everton, if only because we've done well there in the recent past (1). Based on our current form, we should beat West Brom (3).

I don't expect us to get anything at Arsenal (0). Crystal Palace may be a tough game for us, but we must win it and that should push us to a win (3).

So I'd hope for 7 points from the next 4 games. That should see us in about 16/15th place - which, incidental was where we were when Warnock was sacked in Jan 2012.",100,2014-12-08

I'm reasonably confident we can take all 6 points against Palace and WBA - I think we'll lose our first game in a while at HQ against goddamn Swansea, who will be a bogey team for a least a little while longer. However sitting on 20 points when 2015 chimes in should put us in the prime spot to be control our own destiny and not have to pray that other results fall in our favour to stay out of the bottom three. If you're doing that, then realistically your top flight credentials are somewhat called into question, I feel.

Having Leicester cut adrift - which I agree is fully possible - will be a nice little stocking filler. I'm a bit surprised their fans are calling for Pearson's head though - with the Premier League cash boost I think they could do very well indeed in the Championship next season under him.

Crystal game - 1st Row Z1 block. Simply because all other Ellerslie side blocks had been sold out. It also notified me that we may be exposed to the elements as the seating had no cover. Doesn't really concern me, my Australian heritage shall ward off any elemental damage.

Swasea game - R Block, second from the back. There was a few more options, but i would much rather sit in the R block regardless of the view. Hopefully the person sitting between myself and my father could politely shift a seat over.

Well I looked up Bolton and they finished dead last that season. When will someone be held accountable? When will the excuses end? This squad is deficient and Redknapp needs to go. ",95,2014-12-15
superhoops,"Good review. This was definitely an improvement on some previous away performances this season and I suspect that Harry has his eye on the next two home games, which are absolutely crucial. I doubt he'd have started Zamora on the bench otherwise - having Vargas on his own up front to hold up the ball for supporting wingers doesn't make much sense. Now isn't the best time to make an evaluation of our current form - we're at the beginning of a crucial run of fixtures. Let's take another look at the early/mid January - if we're sacrificing away points but not picking them up in the crucial home games, we've got a big problem; but if we beat West Brom and Palace at home, we can then go into the Swansea home fixture with confidence. Then it's Burnley away...

It's certainly a worry that we don't seem able to set up defensively, and I  don't expect anything from the game against Arsenal. We'll probably line up with an experimental, attacking formation, and lose 3-0. But Redknapp will be gambling on getting points from all the games around it, so let's judge ourselves on that basis.

One footnote - inevitably gossip will now turn to the transfer window. Amongst all the nonsense, what's clear is that we could do with a forward who can play alone up top. Bobby has become so important for us that we have to rest him in non-crucial fixtures (never part of the plan) and Charlie isn't at his best when he's playing the supporting striker.",261,2014-12-15
superhoops,"Too many sloppy balls for this league. We'll sink ourselves making those mistakes. I'd say Phillips needs to be playing elsewhere in January, be it on loan or otherwise, but that would leave us short due to the tardy realisation that it's perhaps a bit wiser not to overpay on a weekly basis and monitor transfer spend. I'll be eternally suspicious of Hoilett's vision and hamstring, but he showed today why I am a bit mystified that Fer has been consistently played on the left instead of him. Joey Barton should probably be getting a weekly salary on a level with Henry. I'm not sure what Mutch does yet. A younger, slightly faster version of Gary O'Neil?

On the positive side, Vargas has some beautiful footwork. I also think Fer has some great technique, but I worry that people will turn on him like they did to Mbia. They also didn't drop their heads at 3-0 - it could have been worse if they had packed it in, and with every shitty away result like this, I think goal difference might well come into play during those last few games. I thought we were OK for periods, like OP says. Maybe it would've been a different game had we scored when we were looking menacing early in the match. The problem is as much as we can play Steve Black's game and point to small bundles of positivity, at some point you have to step back and accept that 0 points from all our away games, with that loss to Burton fucking Albion as the garnish, is beyond pathetic. There's a thread on /r/soccer now over how abysmal our Premier League away record is. That doesn't even count the circus that developed in the second half of last season. Maybe QPR players just get too comfortable in the tight confines of Loftus Road, and can't settle into games away?

I recall a lot of people screaming down negativity last season by appealing to our league position in the top 6. The shoe is on the other foot now. Nonetheless I have every bit of confidence that we can beat West Brom and Palace at home, and QPR probably represent excellent value for your ticket money at Loftus Road.

I've played association football for as long as I can remember, and have relatively recently started to get into Premier League (in the past two seasons or so). Being American, most of the games televised hear are Chelsea and Arsenal, so most of my following of QPR has come in the form of checking scores online through BBC and ESPNFC. The match at Goodison was televised in the US, so that leads me to a few questions/observations:

1. The two first goals were both indirectly caused by Joey Barton, with his pass being intercepted at midfield and his foul. Is he usually that reckless? 
2. Who do you feel is the best players on the team?
3. What's everyone's opinion on Yun Suk-Young? I've mostly gotten positive feelings with how he plays defender.
4. What's everyone's opinion on Harry Redknapp? I liked the formation he went with yesterday, but there seemed to be a lack of vision in the attacking third.

superhoops,"Everton was always going to be a tough place to go to, but I think Harry got a lot right with that line-up. We were really solid and frustrated both the team and the fans.

superhoops,I think this sums up my feelings about QPR this season.,11,2014-12-16
superhoops,"/u/Godhatesfats has given you decent answers already, but I'll chime in too.

1. Barton is a character. I quite like the guy. I've repeated myself a lot in saying that I think he is probably on twice the salary his talent level deserves, but he will put his body on the line for the squad. That counts for a lot. I'd rather he hung back in matches though, as I don't think he represents any great attacking threat.

2. Austin would probably command the highest transfer fee and is crucial to winning games. Beyond him, I'd always look to include Vargas, Fer and Caulker in the squad.

3. I've been hoping he'd come good since he signed almost two years ago now. It took for-fucking-ever to get his chance, but I'm glad that he became pretty much the undisputed first choice LB as soon as he put in decent displays at this level. His last game was a bit dodgy, but if he was flawless he probably wouldn't be at QPR.

4. You'll find serious differences in opinion on Redknapp. I won't lie, I dislike the guy. He has a long rap sheet of transgressions in my book, both within and without QPR. It is what it is though, and he is the man at the wheel.

5. I'll second [Loft For Words](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/), which I think is hands down the best fan produced content.

2) Not much doubt about that being Charlie Austin, I don't think? Dunne has been outstanding as well for us. Vargas has really settled. We're a different team with Barton on the pitch, I feel. But I still think Charlie stands out.

3) Yun's been great. He's really solved the left-back woes we've had for so long. Can get forwards when needed but he's not one of those fullbacks who are basically more adapted to LM than LB. He does his defensive duties well.

4) We're a completely different team away from home, as you probably already know. Having Charlie suspended was a huge blow for us as well. With both him and Zamora out, our attack was basically brand new, which I think explains the cluelessness.

However now that he's tasted life at AC Milan, who despite their slight fall from the elite still have the residual fancy infrastructure from their happier years, would he accept a move to a club that isn't all that more prominent than QPR?",127,2014-12-18

superhoops,"I love Charlie, but I think our team is starting to have a dangerous reliance on him. We need a team of good players, not just a single amazing player. While we've got him, though, he's gonna pretty much keep us up.",42,2014-12-20
superhoops,"What a win! Can't help but look back to that time we came back to beat Liverpool 3-2 and turn our season around. I don't enjoy going behind so often and giving teams this many chances, but we play with such an intensity and togetherness that it makes games at LR an absolute joy to watch. Some of the most exciting games of the season have been played there, 3-2 feels like an average result! So proud of our attitude to come back and win. Great team spirit!

Agree with your point about Hill OP. In different respects, him and Kranjcar are superb at slowing the game down. Kranjcar provides the cool head we need to close the game down (his importance is really understated) while Hill makes himself known with his aggression in battling. It was nice to see him back in the team.

Henry wasn't at his best, but I'll let that slide. I've been really impressed by the way he's worked his way into the team. Not his best performance but certainly not a bad one. Barton was fantastic, he's slowly getting back to his best since his injury. Vargas was unimpressive for me again. He needs to remind us what he's capable of. 

At the back it felt like roles were reversed to day. Onuoha was solid, but Dunne and Caulker were all over the place at times. Berahino almost punished us at the end there. I was shocked to see us go down 2-0 at home. There will come a time when teams will hang onto their leads after going ahead here, we've managed to get the 3 points against Leicester and WBA but maybe next time we won't be so lucky. Not their best days.

Charlie Austin ... what is there that needs saying? Give that man a contract.",305,2014-12-20
superhoops,"This is the kind of game where, if Charlie were suspended here instead of against Everton, or his shoulder had gone, we'd have lost 2-0 and we'd all be saying ""oh god it's just like last time."" Instead we're 15th place, more goals scored than Liverpool, and we've finally reached the 1:1 games:points ratio. 

The referee may have fucked us today but we had our fair share of good fortune. On the balance of the chances, they were arguably slightly better, I thought. Our defending was so bad that those two goals could just as well have been own goals. But when we kicked off at 2-0 down I saw the players hyping each other up and fistpumping in a 'come on' fashion. Even 2-0 down we have the spirit at home to keep fighting. Old QPR would've just given up. 

The Vargas substitution for Hoilett irritated me. Vargas was ineffective in the first half but as the game opened up in the second he started finding space and running at his defender. Then Harry subbed him off, at the worst possible time. Meanwhile Fer wad having a pretty poor game but was allowed to continue for the full 90 minutes. It really should've been Fer for Hoilett imo. That way we would've had the pace threat on both flanks.

Aside from that I'd like to whinge at a few more things, such as the sloppy passes in midfield, and the complete absence of the right winger and defender in the first half. I think it goes to show how essential starting Isla and Vargas together is, since that flank is usually one of our biggest threats, but today both Vargas and Onuoha looked rather clueless. 

Of course I'm delighted with the points but we weren't as good as the scoreline shows. We have Charlie and the Loftus Road x-factor to thank for a lot. If that can get us points against Swansea and Palace, and we can mend some gaps in the squad in January -- someone to share Charlie's goal scoring duties and another right back -- I really, really think we're going to stay up.

superhoops,"My disjointed thoughts: 

I don't know if I'd agree with the Fer assessment in this game. I thought he was poor when we were chasing the game, but great for holding the ball up when we were up, this could also have to do with the fact that he was moved into a central role which suits him a lot more than the left wing role. 

These are the kinds of games that we do need to win to stay up, 3 points in the return fixture would also be great.

I also think that Zamora was fantastic in the game, in terms of being a nuisance. We were also missing Isla at times, his link up with Vargas is a lot better than Neddie's. 

The ref also had a really strange game, he was calling everything at the start and in the first half, than had 20 minutes in the second where he let the game flow. It was weird. 

Finally, a personal highlight was getting sung at by the West Brom fans. Never a dull moment. ",178,2014-12-20

superhoops,"First away game I've been to since Chelsea. Nice to see the away faithful are already on board with the gallows humour. Traoré was the villain of choice today. I hate knocking the guy but he should have been pencilled in as a permanent winger years ago. This leftback malarkey isn't his forté. I couldn't join in with the disdain for him but even I burst out laughing when he miscued a pass at the start of the second. As he is such a confidence player this could have been catastrophic for him - maybe he'll be Palace bound after all. Strikes me as a real headache now as occasional superhero cameos aside, I don't think Hill can be first choice at leftback. The left wing was awful until Hoilett came on - at least he put in a few crosses, terrible though the weighting might have been.

Not really convinced by the Niko-Mutch-Henry trio, and I'm once again at a loss as to what Mutch is, and why we paid so...*Mutch* for him.

Pinball football until we concede, with a little extra oomph towards the end. They've put a lot of presure on themselves for the Burnley match now, and that lot might not have the xmas generosity to drop to 10 men.

It was nice to be in with a chance until the final whistle at least, and thank god Isla was back. Caulker and Vargas are quality players.

Edit: I should add that it's infuriating to see players standing around waiting for the ball...you need more clever attacking runs as options for a pass. Hoilett, I'm looking at you. You beat your man respectably a few times today, but you could've got away more cleanly if you zipped forward more often.",294,2014-12-26

superhoops,"Really bad performance. We're seeing the effects of the overreliance on Charlie Austin. As soon as he got the ball there was a sharp intake of breath from everyone around me, even if he was only by the cornerflag. 

He's a bloody great player, but he's a poacher, not a magician. He'll get us goals but not in the way that Taarabt did. He won't randomly turn on the magic and score a goal on his own from a seemingly impossible situation, but if you leave him lurking in the box and you feed him he'll get you something. 

The entire team needs to work if Charlie is to work. People need to be pumping in balls into the box, delivering something to his feet or head. But no one did. There were no real chances ""created"" as such by us the entire game. 

Barton was poor. Fer was worse. But worst of all was Zamora, who won precisely nothing all game long. We need to start transitioning away from the ""hoof it to Bobby"" strategy, I think. It's not exactly a recipe for long term success. 

And therein the problem with Harry. He just doesn't have the tactical mind to make that kind of a change. We played his beloved 4-4-2 with two strikers and two wingers who can run at their defenders, and the rest of them can just fackin' run around a bit. The problem is that Hoilett and Philips just aren't good enough. And we have no plan b.

Most alarming of all is that we have now had all the ""easy"" home games, and now come the ""easy"" away games. Which means we have to win away or beat mid and top table teams at home. It'll be a tough second half of the season, especially remembering that we'll need a big points cushion for the difficult run-in. Hope Harry has his eyes on some good transfer targets this January.

We are in 15th place purely on home form, (which I think is brilliant for reasons I will list below). Away form is terrible but (Tottenham, Man Utd, Southampton, West Ham, Chelsea, Newcastle, Swansea, Everton &amp; Arsenal) is a crazy run in and I would have only expected to pick up maybe 1 or 2 points from that run in (at most) and was not surprised when we didn't pick up anything.

We survived crunch-time Christmas and came out looking good. 3 massive home games; 2 wins and a draw (and frankly that West Brom game was a Christmas gift from Austin).

We have a reverse fixture list in the second half of the season. I.e Easier games away and Harder at home but if we can keep up our home form (like we did vs Liverpool and Man City) I can see us nicking a win or two and a few draws at home from here.

I think West Ham have only sent him to us on the basis that we pay his whole wage (around £40k from what I've read), as Sam wants to bring in more players. 

Otherwise, I'm happy with this deal. I think Zarate is a type of forward who is different from who we currently have (I.e. Austin & Zamora combo). I also think this works in our favour as it means Zarate won't be playing for any relegation rivals (he was linked with Sunderland and West Brom I think). ",121,2014-12-29
superhoops,"There's 7 or 8 teams that will be scrapping it. Harry is right in saying it, there's no way we can tell what's going to happen, we will find out on the last day of the season. 

Agree with your ratings, though I'm not sure if I'd give Onuoha an honourable mention just yet; he hasn't convinced me. I have a feeling when Sandro is back in our midfield him and Barton will be a force! There is plenty of reason for encouragement, at least when you take into consideration how miserable our EPL experiences usually are. 

That Burnley game is going to be absolutely massive. I've got to be honest I would probably take a point. If we could somehow get a win from there it would be a huge result.",132,2014-12-29

superhoops,A team can't lose 9 straight away games and get a good grade. I give the team a C with the hope things change for the better after the transfer window.,31,2014-12-29
superhoops,"I think it's safe to say that we'll be in the mix to avoid relegation this season. If we pick up a few points away, we could get a bit clear of the relegation zone. Any drop in home form and we'll be right back down there. I'd give us a C+ for the first half of the season, since we are barely passing but not doing as well as hoped. 

My worry is the january transfer window. Obviously reinforcements would be a huge help in several areas, but if we bring in mercenaries or slackers, it has the potential to ruin the team spirit. Let's hope we don't do anything too desperate. The summer transfers were good , so I'm optimistic. It's a good sign that we didn't rush into buying an inferior last minute replacement for Remy.",139,2014-12-29
superhoops,"I think we've just equalled the record for consecutive away losses for the equivalent period in any of the previous two decades' Premier League campaigns? Considering we've spent a fair bit of money, I'd mark the season as a C, weighted upwards based on respectable home form. Taking each of those away games in isolation, you might say we were underdogs and the results aren't a surprise. However taken as a group, I would have expected at least a win and a draw somewhere.",84,2014-12-29
superhoops,"C. 

I agree with your player assessments but would add Zamora to those performing with distinction, he deserves a fair chunk of the credit that Charlie is getting. That 2nd goal against West Brom is the perfect example - the header from Dunne came back to Bobby off the bar, about a yard from goal, but instead of instinctively heading it back towards goal he knew where Charlie was and squared it to him. Everyone (rightly) praised Charlie for being in the right place, and for his striker's instinct, but equally important there is Zamora suppressing his own striker's instinct for the benefit of the team.

One aspect of the season that is pleasing is that we appear to be learning from past mistakes - something we've always been terrible at in the past. We ditched the 3-5-2 early on; we appear to have more modest ambitions and are capable of scrapping. In our relegation season, lest we forget, we were modelled as a boutique club playing flowing attacking football - it was all about style, and we got trounced by savvy, superior sides. We still need to figure out how to shut games down, particularly away from home and in the final 20 mins, when we've conceded a lot of goals. We do not set up well defensively and have conceded way too many goals. If we can bring that 'goals against' column down, we should be fine. ",239,2014-12-29

superhoops,"No idea. What is he good at? Technique? Stamina? Defending? Supporting the strikers from midfield? I was impressed when I saw him miss a diving header from an Austin cross in the opener against Hull. I thought maybe we'd have a marauding midfield player the right end of his 20s. Since then...I don't see how he fits any tactical scheme we've wheeled out. Frustrating, and expensive. Browsing Cardiff forums it seems a common knock against him was becoming anonymous in midfield (Jermaine Jenas like). Might be accurate.

Main concern is that we're not exactly blessed with a track record of improving young players in recent times. Hoilett, Traoré, Phillips and Mutch - are they any better now than they were two years ago?",123,2014-12-31
superhoops,"I don't think it's fair to be judging him just yet considering the injuries he's had to deal with. Let's assess him after he's had a run in the team. Him, Sandro and Vargas will all have points to prove in the second half of the season and I'm confident they will all improve. Joey has needed a few games to get up to speed and Mutch will need more time to adjust. ",73,2014-12-31

Why the fuck would he have a pot-shot at goal in injury time while 1-0 up against 10 men? Just take it to the corner flag you muppet.

He is just pace, that's all he is. He has no final ball and just runs at people and then loses possession. 

And then when he tracked back on Ki he did nothing and Ki cut inside him way too fucking easily. Fuck.

I'm blaming the loss of 2 points squarely on Hoilett, he should never make another appearance for us again.",110,2015-01-01
superhoops,"I have stoutly defended him for the past few months, but my support of him is wavering. Very fast. 

I wouldn't put the loss of 2 points down to him, yeah he could of handled that better but there were 10 other men on that pitch who all could have played better.

I haven't seen any progression of him as a player during his time here, if anything he has gotten worse from the player he was all them years ago at Blackburn. 

I'm at a loss with a few players in our squad at the moment. ",97,2015-01-01
superhoops,"My main problem with Hoilett is that he doesn't seem to want to use his pace when beating a player. He doesn't run at the man, he runs to the man, stops, tries to beat him with skill and loses the ball. I noticed it more when we were in the Championship but it still happens. Also he has the worst first touch of any professional player I have ever seen. ",71,2015-01-01

Such a hard result to take, they scored with pretty much their only shot on goal from open play. 

This game just goes to show how much we need to win away. We must get a result from Burnley.",67,2015-01-01

2. I didn't realise how far Rob Green was out of his area. I don't care what anyone says the luck was with us yesterday. If we had to play 75+minutes with 10 men. We would have lost that. The luck just didn't extend to a win.",57,2015-01-02

superhoops,"Would we have lost though? It seems like going down to 10 men is becoming increasingly irrelevant in today's football. Chelsea Came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at the Nou Camp after going down to 10, we beat Derby with 10 men, Swansea only scored after they went down to 10. Going down to 10 can instill spirit in a team and make the other side get overconfident.

superhoops,"I remember a few years ago after Redknapp won the FA Cup with Portsmouth but got them relegated too, and there was a radio phone-in asking Portsmouth fans whether they'd rather have stayed up and not won the FA Cup instead of winning it and getting relegated, and opinion was very divided. Obviously looking at the position of their club now they would have perhaps not ended up in League Two had they still remained in the Premier League benefiting from all the TV money, but some say that winning the FA Cup is a day that you'll never forget and for fans of smaller clubs will quite possibly never be seen again in your lifetime. If you ask Mandaric or whoever the chairman was it'd be a no-brainer but for the fans it's a more difficult decision. As a fan I'd love to see us win the FA Cup even if we did go down, and to be honest I think it'd be quite interesting to see what would happen if we did get relegated to the Conference or whatever is currently being touted, it'd be a great story and it'd be great to be the biggest team in a small pond(s). And I don't really buy the argument that it's a drain on the team, it's only five extra games at the end of the day and it's not like the League Cup where it's midweek and players could suffer from a lack of rest - weekends are devoted to the FA Cup and that wouldn't have a noticeable effect on player fatigue for me, obviously there's the occupational hazards of injuries but that comes with the package. Considering we've only won two games in fourteen years in the FA Cup according to a post I read today I think we're due a decent run sometime soon.",309,2015-01-03
superhoops,"I'd love a run but realistically going down would be such a disaster for the  club we need to put all the eggs in the league basket.

Ferdinand was a poor buy as well, we keep shafting ourselves when we bring in famous defenders, first Samba now Rio. We look Championship level without Caulker.

superhoops,"Hoilett - Hughes signing status is finally catching up to him. Useless on the gallop today.

Traoré - looks out of sorts. Still think he should be ahead of Hoilett in the pecking order for the left wing, couple of tricky moves on the attack today, some of which worked, some didn't. I think he knows how to play as a leftback, it's just that he can't do it - same way that I know a few guitar chords, and how hey are put into sequence to make Runaway Train by Soul Asylum, but couldn't earn an apple core busking it out.

Onuoha - not sure if he's just very rusty, or not as good as we all want him to be. He's always had a rocky time under Redknapp. Didn't think there was much improvement when he swapped into Caulkers CB position either.

Ferdindand - as per usual, it was a nail-biter whenever he found himself one-on-one in a footrace.

Mutch, Phillips - thought they started quite brightly, running around nicely, nothing too technical but enthusiastic enough, getting into positions, harassing the ball carriers and there was a very nice early intercepted pass by young Jordon, which I thought he might storm forwards at their goal. Thought it fizzled out pretty quickly though, and as soon as we went down...pah. I don't think Mutch has any creativity to add to our midfield, and pairing him with Henry looks just as flat as most other matchdays.

Austin - all over the pitch today doing work, not sure that's best for the league form but hey, that's the measure of the guy. He looked very frustrated on a number of occasions.

Fer - sweet jesus when he made that final passback all I could see was his dumb face really leaning into that Merry Christmas lipsync video the club put out. Said passback was very ill-advised, and ended in a cruel, cruel goal against McCarthy, with Campbell-Rice dancing on the ball before slotting it home. Edit: [Here is said event.](https://vine.co/v/OdHTTI1VXtl)

Zamora - not today.

Vargas -  had some nice diagonal runs cutting inside, although ultimately futile...a bit like Townsend back in 2013, who similarly lacked supporting cast.

Sheffield United had loads of little guys, lots of pace and were ravenous. A lot less of the hoofball as well. Fully deserved the win.

A lot of away support will sing ""That's why you're going down"" this season. Today was the first time it actually made me wonder if they had it right. These weren't fringe players and they weren't kids. Beyond Austin's goal instincts, I don't think we have any individual magic that will change games outside of the tactics.

Practically a whole new club.  We are organized so much better now than we were back then, even if we still aren't getting the results we need.

superhoops,"I can't say I blame you, things look pretty bleak for the next few of months, I'm bracing for a painful period. There are, however, positives. We'll right in the middle of a traffic jam of clubs, and have a bigger squad than any of them, so as the season wears on we have an advantage there. We have a goalscorer - essential if you're going to dig your way out of the bottom of the table. Our home form is still good. Those points indicate that although we're not going to achieve the mid-table security that we should, we will pick up enough points to stay in touch with the league and, with a bit of luck, survive. Beyond that, who knows, but it'll be a lot easier to restructure if we're still in the league.",137,2015-01-11
superhoops,"Apparently some of the folks coming back on the train yesterday bust out a ""we're going down with the Harry"" chant. We're handcuffed to him and sinking is the sensation I get. Take a look at the fixture list to the right there - the schedule is brutal now. While I don't trust any alleged QPR ITK accounts that much (take a gander at [@hillmania](https://twitter.com/hillmania)'s tweets yesterday for some food for thought) , there are enough stories flying around that even if you connect the dots for a handful, it seems we are indeed out of serious transfer funds to make any drastic additions. With relegation on the cards, there'd be no point in signing someone up to a lengthy contract anyway.

When you look at how Swansea and Southampton have built themselves up into established Premier League teams, it seriously makes you wonder just what the maniacs running the asylum are playing at. when you consider the obscene, obscene, obscene resources that have been pumped into QPR. £200mn worth of debt later, there's absolutely nothing to show for it. Haphazard team selections, the oldest manager going with no apparent tactical convictions, and owner hopelessly devoted to him, woefully unbalanced squads of players, not a brick laid for a new training ground, so much talk, so little action. How much will it suck watching Austin in another club's shirt next season?

superhoops,"I'm at the end of my tether with this club. I'm sick of staying up until 2am to watch poor defending, inaccurate passes and half hearted efforts. So here are so thoughts that I have. 

In the post match press conference Redknapp claims that we don't have he quality on the pitch to compete at this level, this is utter bullshit. We have the third highest goal scorer in the league and I would argue that any player in our starting lineup against Burnley could be in the starting lineup of Crystal Palace who beat Tottenham whilst we were getting shafted at Turf Moor.

After the game Dunne got in the verbal stoush with the away R fans. The only thing that this shows me is that Redknapp has lost the respect of Dunne who is considered a leader of the club and should be leading by example. It shows such poor discipline that I struggle to think of any player that would show such a clear level of disrespect towards his fans, his manager and his club. It epitomises exactly what is wrong with this club.

Burnley away was our chance to get the season back on track by getting a much needed away win. But instead none of the players looked like they cared at all. Unfortunately, if we can't beat Burnley away then we can't beat anyone away.

I'm not writing this to say that I have given up on QPR because the sad truth is that I will always be the sucker that loves this club and is left disappointed. I am writing this to say that I am going on strike from this club. Until QPR get an away point, a single away point, I am not going to be back on this subreddit, I'm not going to look at QPR news, I'm not going to look at the QPR or any QPR players twitter. I will look at the QPR score after every game has finished in order to see if my strike can come to an end and that is it.

Let me make this perfectly clear, I'm not doing this because I think it will change anything or that it will help or do anything at all. I'm doing this for me and that is all.",384,2015-01-11
superhoops,"It really sucks that we're *yet again* in a position where we need to make new signings to keep us up. Fuck it, what else can we do? ",28,2015-01-11
superhoops,"We were getting slaughtered away and looked completely out of sorts. We'd already dropped points at home to Stoke and Hull and looked like we just wanted to go straight back down. We were playing some terrible football. 

But we turned it round for a bit and showed what a force we can be at home. We could have easily got 4 points vs Liverpool and City and have come so close to getting points on innumerable other occasions. Why should we be worried about our next 6 home games when City and Liverpool were both so lucky to avoid defeats? 

We've got Sandro coming back, Taarabt might want to prove something, and Yun and Zarate will be starting soon. Let's try and get behind the team a little bit instead of calling for Harry's head as soon as we drop points, yeah? There's only 2 or 3 points between us and 15th if I remember correctly. 

If Heaton doesn't pull off that wondersave to stop Vargas scoring yesterday we could have won that game. Instead we lost due to silly mistakes. These things happen, you go through good patches and bad patches. 

If we lose the next few games and end up at the bottom of the table then we can start worrying but for fuck's sake let's try and keep the faith and support the team and not stop watching games until we start winning again. ",238,2015-01-11
superhoops,Austin struggling to revel in his own goalscoring form after 2-1 defeat at Burnley,14,2015-01-11
superhoops,"I consider myself optimistic, yet realistic when it comes down to QPR. The issue is that I feel that there is a huge game of 'tug of war' being played with the fans, the team and Harry redknapp. We have a brilliant home record, undoubtably good for a team that is fighting for survival, but we cannot take anything from an away game? We spend and spend and change and change, but still cannot find a solution. We get excited at prospects in Vargas, Sandro and Taarabt. Then we get thrown some media bullshit b/w HR and Taarabt, before him being selected for a HUGE game against Burnley, a game that can restore form and optimism about our future. HR is never questioned about the tactics behind our play and always provides general comments that have been stated a million times already. We bring in Rio and Vargas, for them to be replaced by Zamora and Dunne. We get rid of Simpson, whilst being short for cover.

All I have to say is that I can understand fans frustration, as I have had a bad feeling in my stomach since the Burnley game which will probably last until we are out of the relegation zone. I appreciate what HR has done. Yes we have an expensive team, yes on paper we should be winning games left, right and centre, but he has sorted this team out. HR is not very inspiring, which is what QPR lack right now in management as TF, a man I look to for positivity, is in a world of his own. Maybe HR should be looking at retirement by the end of the year or sooner, not because he isn't necessarily good as a manager, but he seems out of sorts in terms of passion and inspiration.

We just need take a breather, and really look at getting 3 points with the players we have, not taking relying on loans to get us over the line.

superhoops,"In 2012/2013 Redknapp did whatever he could to try to save the team from relegation.  A team that didn't want to be together for god sakes, I think the words ""toxic dressing room"" were thrown about.  He got in Remy, who turned out to be fantastic, and definitely worth the money he was getting.  Samba, not so much, but we did recoup our money on him.  The end of the season comes along and with it relegation.  The squad churn for the next season looks like this:

In: Dunne, Simpson, Austin, O'Neil, Kranjcar, Assou-Ekotto, Henry, Carroll, Phillips, Benayoun, Doyle.

Out: M'Bia, Granero, Park, Bosingwa, Mackie, Fabio, Diakite.  Not including the retirement of Derry and Nelsen.

For a grand total of 18 players who came into and left the squad.  That has a terrible effect on cohesion and chemistry and the fact we were still able to achieve promotion is a master class on the part of Redknapp in my opinion.  Not only that but the atmosphere in the change room improved dramatically, something which, as I said, plagued us in 2012/2013.  So the end of the season comes and we absolutely barely achieve promotion, with a side that did not have enough quality to compete in the top flight.

So we come back back for the 2014/2015 season and with the exception of Mutch and thus far, Ferdinand, Redknapp injects quality into the side in the form of Fer, Isla, Vargas, Caulker and Sandro.  We lose an ungodly amount of away games, albeit to top sides, and maintain a fairly decent home record.  Then we lose to Burnley away, arguably the one team we should've been able to get points from, due to an uncharacteristically bad performance, and we all go off the chain and call for Redknapp's head.

Regardless of what anyone says, the club has made progress since two years ago.  I remember watching the games in 2012/2013 and being disgusted with our lack of work ethic and overall perception that no one cared.  I have not had those same feelings this year, regardless of our garbage performance at Burnley.",352,2015-01-14

Talks about massively inflated contracts and doesn't even give one example.  A less than quick Google search also reveals no official information with respect to the talked about players' actual wages.  In fact, we shipped out all the players we could on exorbitant wages but those past mistakes still weigh heavy on us.

We spent more than Burnley and Leicester, of course we did, we had to.  Unlike those two clubs, we had no cohesive core of top-flight calibre players.  Caulker, Isla and Fer have been great for us.  When Sandro was fit he contributed as well.

I know that there are numerous occasions where a January signing have saved a season for teams but i just don't see it being anyone but the players who are here, who can do it. 
In the past 3 years, this team played best when they were a ""band of brothers"", and maybe my faith is blind, but i do have faith in our players to keep us safe from relegation. 
People have been questioning whether Yun is good enough and saying his form slipped before injury, but his injury was nagging and he was probably playing in pain for a few games. ",130,2015-01-27
superhoops,"I agree with all this. I would add that our reliance on Zamora has led to us resting him for away games - when we rely on him most. If we could get a striker who can hold the ball up as well as Bobby then we can play the same tactics away from home as we do at Loftus Road. If we'd played like we did against Utd last week in our away games - same tactics, same application - we'd be way up the table. 

Realistically what we can expect is Redknapp waiting until the 11th hour then bringing in the best player he can find for the best price, regardless of where he plays. ",117,2015-01-27
superhoops,"Just a quick point since this is a new post. Manning didn't play for the under 21's this week. Maybe he could make his way into the bench. Very hopeful, but somewhat possible.

We don't need any more striker or midfielders in my opinion. A right winger would do us good, but it isn't a necessity. A LB is what we need for cover. 

Big game against Stoke, just like every other fixture this season if we want to survive.",80,2015-01-27
superhoops,"This is an important window for us.  The last chance to add quality to a team that is eye to eye with a real fight to stay in the Prem.  I think we have some areas that should be improved in these last few days.  

Back Four.  Thankfully, all but the LB position is taken care of.  It is by no means without its problem but it is competent.  Caulker has done really well for us since coming in at CB, probably the signing who we've gotten the most out of this year.  Dunne has also stepped up his game to Premier League level, something we weren't sure he'd be able to achieve at this stage in his career.  Onuoha, while not getting the first team run he had probably hoped for, has proved adequate and on occasions even creative. Isla, on a loan, has really developed into a decent RB which is lucky for us considering his usual position is up higher on the wing.  When it comes to LB, it looked as if Yun was the answer.  He put in a string of good performances but gradually tailed off until his recent injury.  Hill has come in and done a job but he is being played out of position and it shows.  Traore is not a Premier League LB.  Maybe he could do better up the wing but he is not a defensive player.  Yun looks to be ready to make a return but if we need anything on defense I think it is a proper LB.

Midfield.  I'd say we are worse off in midfield than defense honestly.  Fer has shown to be a competent midfielder and has in all fairness done well on the left wing.  Problem is, he is not a winger, and needs to be played more centrally.  Hoilett, the obvious choice on the left wing, lost his chance after several games of inaccurate crosses and less than impressive decision making.  He does have pace and the ability to score but he is a player who must be played to his strengths.  Henry has proven to be our most consistent midfielder this year, which came as even more of a surprise than Dunne's resurgence.   While not particularly creative every midfield needs a player who can deliver a good performance every time.  Barton, after a promising season last year in the Championship, has faded this year and in my opinion is under performing.  Sandro, Mutch and Kranjcar are all wild cards in the matter.  Sandro and Kranjcar have both shown quality this year but it has largely been hit and miss, and also marred with injury.  If these two, especially Sandro can see the season out injury-free it would at least give us more options centrally.  Mutch, who enjoyed a career best season at Cardiff last year, has been unable to achieve the same quality for us.  His form must improve before he will get a run in the first team.  On the right we have Vargas, another loan option who has done well for us considering he, like Fer, is playing out of position.  In a similar vein we will not get the best out of him unless we play him at striker or attacking midfield.  Phillips, in similar style to Hoilett, who we thought would be the natural selection for right midfielder also showed an inability to play at the standard required for Premier League level football.  We have to wonder about Hoilett and Phillips, can they make a comeback?  I think we need a proper winger in midfield, on the right.  If we picked up a right winger Vargas could move back to his natural position giving us more options up front.  Lastly on the midfield list is Taarabt.  Honestly I just want to see him leave.  He is a drama causing eyesore on a club whose only focus should be avoiding relegation.

Charlie Austin.  I could also say our strikers but the two are basically synonymous up to this point.  Without Charlie we'd be wrecked.  Bashed and battered on the rocks.  He's been a godsend for QPR and his goal scoring record alone has done nothing less than keep us in the thick of this relegation race.  Zamora has assisted with whatever he's been able to but his age is definitely showing on the pitch and he cannot last the entire 90 mins.  I'm real proud of Zamora, he's shown heart, but his time is winding down.  Zarate, our only loan signing this window, comes from West Ham having fallen out with manager Sam Allardyce.  Going through some match reports on the fixtures he did play in for West Ham, Zarate is known for changing a game and looking a threat.  While his fitness is questioned, he could pan out to be a good gamble.  I wouldn't be surprised if he started against Stoke.  Just based on the fact we've already acquired one striker on loan I don't think we will get another in.

The recent game against Millwall featured Mutch, Hoilett, Phillips and Zarate.  Redknapp is surely trying to get them playtime in hopes their form can improve and they can launch themselves into the first team but as of yet, they have all fizzled.  Time will tell if they can improve, but in these last few days of this last transfer window, we could do well for two more players on loan and I think that is all.",909,2015-01-27

superhoops,"I think it's time.


It seems pretty clear. Ow that Harry has absolutely no tricks left in the bag. Over the course of this month we haven't been close to bringing in someone who could solve our problems, and the team has been anything but an advertisement for someone to join the side. We've looked really uninspired in matches where we should do better, and can never seem capable of playing to the level we gave when we come up against some of the top sides.

I'm convinced Harry can't keep us up this season. We're better off with an interim manager who could inspire any kind of unity or excitement in this side, and bringing in someone real in the summer.

superhoops,"Agreed.  He is sentimental and old-fashioned, and its incredibly frustrating to watch.  Since day 1, there has been no clear sense of tactics.  With a side thats mid-table on paper and in all reports hard-working and dedicated, it is completely the managers fault if they are unorganized, sloppy, and playing without unity and purpose.

We don't even look like we're playing in the same league as other teams.  I watched a replay of Burnley and Man City, that great game a few weeks back and I was amazed with how Burnley played.  They played exactly like a relegation team should play: pace, purpose, crunching tackles, and general chemistry.  We dont have that. Or anything close to that, and its 100% Redknapps fault.

On a side, I think we're garbage in the center of the park.  Henry is good for nothing more than hard work, and Barton makes far too many mistakes and giveaways to be considered a true playmaker.  Week after week those two get overrun, and it'll be a blessing when the glass man Sandro returns.",177,2015-01-31

superhoops,"I'd avoid the Lower School End, as it seems to have become the touristy stand.

When you look at the seat map for choosing where you want to sit, you should be able to distinguish a pattern in the the South Africa Road and Ellerslie Road stands - there are diagonal lines of available seats. The reason they are available and not taken by ST holders is that they have views restricted by the support columns for the roof. Best avoided.

Otherwise staptiudupe has given you agood summary. That P, Q, R and S corner should be noisy. Upper Loft good views. Front of any block in the SAR stand good.

I can't imagine the Platinum seats being anything special to be honest.",123,2015-02-02

superhoops,"I wouldn't rule out another twist in the tale this season. The odds are now stacked against us surviving, but it's not as bad as people are making out. Our squad is decent. Our ground is tough for top teams to play at (sometimes), and while our away form is now infamous the only reason for it is Redknapp's tactical incapability. Playing away from home when you are one of the league's worst teams is all about having a plan, sticking to it, and giving maximum effort. Those are three attributes that Redknapp was never capable of providing. We now have a run of home fixtures against top teams where we will be fighting for our lives - don't be surprised to see an upset or two. At the same time we will be on the road to some of the lesser teams, without the manager who has cocked up every away game of the entire season. 

It's not likely, but it's not impossible. And if it does happen, prepare yourselves for all the commentors and journos who are writing us off now acting like they predicted it all along - 'no I'm not surprised to see QPR climb up nearer mid-table, with that squad it's what you would expect' etc etc,",212,2015-02-08

superhoops,Would rather see Hill at CB than Ferdinand to be honest.,11,2015-02-08
superhoops,"Looking back on yesterday, I think we were good for a point. Infuriating result aside, some of Taarabt's work was worth the price of admission alone. Get him properly match fit (if possible) and the others in tune with him and who knows? As it stands a few of his passes went nowhere because the others weren't positioned to receive them. As soon as the ball is heading towards him, that's the time to anticipate what is going to happen, where you need to be and start running there.

Phillips had his best game in a while I thought. There's a decent cross in there, it's just beating his man that looks to be a problem.

I worry that Redknapp has broken Traoré. Different tasks, different positions, inconsistent selection. It saddens me because at the very least, this guy wants to be in London. His level of English is pretty indicative of how settled he is here and if only he could slot into a team unit as opposed to getting rinsed on lack of talent/confidence/match speed, we might have a nice, loyal player there. I hope the new guys don't bomb him out completely again. At least he should be here next year, and under the FFP circumstances I can see him getting a long run in the team no matter what.

Zarate looked pretty encouraging, although maybe he was just playing with a point to prove. Let's not be pessimistic though, perhaps there's a decent player in there who can ball a few goals. He certainly seemed to have the legs for it.

You just can't be lining up with Hill at leftback from the get-go. On top of being unreliable for supporting  attacking phases, he's a card risk as he is very hands-on in his defending, clawing at his man. Let's see how Yun does.

Personal opinion, but Onuoha needs a run at centreback, as he needs as much matchtime practicing being a pinball flipper as possible. Again yesterday, I thought his footwork on the ball isn't all that. Apparently he might be injured too though, so we might have superman Ferdinand to look forward to. Frankly that's a thought that terrifies me.

Based on yesterday's performance and system, I think Barton's retention over Henry is the right call. Give Fer some more time playing central, and maybe we'll have our best looking midfield for this final stretch.

In a way I think the next two matches are reasonably benign - there are scarier away matches I can think of than Sunderland and Hull. If we are going to survive, I think it has to be at the expense of Hull. Pray to your gods that Villa somehow defeat them (with an own goal?). They have a cluster of matches from Chelsea to Arsenal that might well sink their battleship. It would also be nice if Burnley stuck to the script and lost to Man U and Southampton. Leicester's next four games might see them well and truly cut adrift.

That final day of the season - Leicester vs. QPR and Villa vs. Burnley might be a heart stopper.

If we do go down, is Sherwood really the right man? Does he want a Championship gig? Given the player exodus (awesome planning from those in charge), impending fines, etc. I on no way expect to come close to bouncing back. They'd be looking at building a squad on the cheap (free signings) and within the reasonably tight confines of QPR's ordinary means. I hope it's something they are seriously thinking about - now is the time to start thinking about out of contract players who won't be wanting big money and can play within a set system. Maybe one or two promising players from Leagues One and Two. We'll be begging a loan player or two from the Premier League. The era of throwing money around for short-term fixes should be well and truly over. Then we'll see the true extent of the owners' patience.",668,2015-02-08

I have a cousin over from Chicago on the weekend that QPR play Tottenham at home. I went to visit him in the summer and he was good enough to take me to a baseball game, so it'd be great to return the favor with a London derby. I saw tickets are on general sale and would love to get two, but you have to have registered as a membership by the 9th Feb. Any help or guidance would really be appreciated!",84,2015-02-16
superhoops,"Can't you buy them when they go on public sale. I bought tickets to Swansea and Crystal games over Christmas from Australia with no problem. Arsenal will be undoubtedly a bigger game with a higher chance of them being sold out, but i would still guess that you would just need to be aware of purchasing as soon as the tickets become available to the public.",66,2015-02-16
superhoops,Could you buy them on 3rd party ticket sites?,9,2015-02-16
superhoops,"tl;dr ""we need 37-40 points"". Well, file that under ""things we already knew.""

What's more interesting is how we're going to get them. On the 1st of Jan we drew 1-1 with Swansea at home, bringing us to 19 points. If we take 40 points to be the threshold for safety, that means we were still missing 21 points, which is equal to 7 wins. So, during the 2nd half of the season, we need to win 7 times (or 6, and 3 draws; or 5, and 6 draws, and so on until we run out of available fixtures), in order to reach 40 points.

Since that game against Swansea we've managed to pick up only 3 points with the win against Sunderland. This means we now need 6 wins from our remaining 13 games. Let's have a look at which those remaining fixtures are:

* Sat 21 Feb - Hull (A)

* Wed 4 Mar - Arsenal (H)

* Sat 7 Mar - Tottenham (H)

* Sat 14 Mar - Crystal Palace (A)

* Sat 21 Mar - Everton (H)

* Sat 4 Apr - West Brom (A)	

* Sat 11 Apr - Chelshit (H)

* Sat 18 Apr - Aston Villa (A)

* Sat 25 Apr - West Ham (H)

* Sat 2 May - Liverpool (A)

* Sat 9 May - Man City (A)	

* Sat 16 May - Newcastle United (H)	

* Sun 24 May - Leicester (A)

There are five fixtures in there that stand out as being especially tough -- Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelski, Liverpool and City. If we assume that we lose those, that gives us 8 games out of which to get 6 wins. 

Since it's difficult to imagine that happening, the only alternative is that we have to cause some upsets against the big teams. Three of those five tough games are at home, though, and we'll have a go against anyone at Loftus Road. Anyway, summa summarum, we need to cause upsets against the big teams to reach that 40-point mark to have a realistic chance at surviving.",347,2015-02-17

superhoops,"This guy is a poster on LFW who (apparently) works for SI and is beloved by some there for his analysis. [I think this post is worthy of being repeated]( http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/forum/140923/rio--woeful-performance-today./#7) here:

&gt;Part of the problem is that playing a high intensity and pressing game, especially against technically superior teams, is always hard work. It's difficult for sides who are in tip-top physical shape to maintain that for the entire 90 minutes, let alone a side like ours, which doesn't have the best fitness record or work ethic. 

&gt;It's that work ethic and desire to work hard that's the obvious problem. It has improved, but it's still not been enough yet. There were plenty of occasions, even when we were doing well, where I was yelling from the stands about the lack of speed they took to get back into shape for any turnover of possession. This affects everything and Spurs and Arsenal, Spurs particularly, had great depth and shape to their play. If you're not in the right position at all times, then you're going to make life difficult for yourself and in the moment you switch off, you're punished. 

&gt;The defence and attack are simply not always resetting their positions quickly enough, which means they're further apart from the next nearest unit, and which means if play breaks down or requires support, they're not in the right place to help sustain attacks or deal with impending danger. 

&gt;Take Spurs' second goal, for example, where we had Mauricio Isla play a silly ball down the line that he didn't need to make, and wasted possession. Charlie Austin chased after it, and was irritated by the ball, but then Austin decided to chase after it anyway when it was gone already and came well out of position. He looked dejected and annoyed, slowed down, then moaned (rightly so) at Isla for making such an impatient pass. Spurs took the ball, played it back inside where Austin should have been, but now he was out of play, and he signalled to Bobby Zamora and complained to Zamora that he wasn't filling in when he should and suddenly they were out of the game, Spurs had plenty of time on the ball... 

&gt;The rest of the units behind paused, not sure whether to sit and hold or press without those two in the picture and before you knew it, Ryan Mason was wondering around unopposed and picked out an easy ball over the top because the defence were now not in the right place either. And it's a goal and game over. 

&gt;Little details make a big difference. You can't afford to switch off for a moment and you've got to be prepared to work hard for every single minute of every single game. If they do that, they'll improve and see results improve. If they don't, then it's a much of a muchness and be reliant on people taking their chances when they come.",493,2015-03-08

I think we have to be realistic on Ramsey. There appears to be an understanding in place that he isn't a shoe-in for the permanent gig, and this is for the best. I don't want to be harsh with him, but at the same time I don't want to give him a free pass simply because his predecessor jumped ship in the early hours after having all of his deadline day deals fall through.

Yun does look good. I'd be happier if he could get a few more left-footed crosses in though, but then again it's not as if he's had a long run of games to formulate some kind of understanding with a regular left winger ahead of him.",197,2015-03-09

All of our loanees will return leaving us with a core of players who took us up in the Championship.

As for a line-up i'm thinking:

------------------Green/McCarthy-------------------

Furlong------Onuoha-------Dunne/Hill----------Yun

Phillips-------Henry---------Barton---Traore/Hoilett

---Grego-Cox/Petrasso---Some Player from Eredivise ;)

Subs: Faurlin, Doughty, Robinson, Kpekwa, Ehmer

I'm not too sure that Zamora will still be with us due to retirement age. I think Dunne still has another 5 seasons with him, especially at Championship level. 

I would like to see Caulker and Fer loaned out, but i don't think that should be necessary unless we miraculously go straight back up. In terms of the subs, i don't know enough about our youth to be too decisive. I think we should try to offload Hoilett, just because i find him a bit of a waste of space. Honestly i think this would be a pretty decent starting 11, especially if the 6'8"" player we pick up from the Eredevisie is decent. 

Should be another interesting year for r/superhoops.

superhoops,"[Here's an overview of most of the contract situatiuon](http://www.indyrs.co.uk/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=16006). One of the biggest headaches I see actually comes from two players who have flown under the radar in the wake of more outrageous player contract/performance ratios - Onuoha and Hoilett. They both signed at a time when contracts were very generous indeed, and they'll both be collecting on these for another year. In this impending future of severe cutbacks, these two will probably be collecting the equivalent salaries of 2-3 players each.

There are a couple of stupid deals which will be even more eye-watering in the brave new world - Taarabt, Caulker, Sandro and Fer. I can imagine the latter three might be saleable but the day might arrive when we let Taarabt go on a free (fuck you Levy and your 40% sell on clause) or, lamentably, loan him back to Italy while subsidising his very steep salary.

At this point I think Yun has done enough wrong as well as right to throw off any suitors. We might be facing a logjam with Robinson coming back though. I have no idea what Robinson's playing style is. Given that we'll almost certainly be lumbered with Onuoha, they I'd go out and pick up a fresh leader at the back. They need someone vocal and authoritative to compliment the other three. At this stage I don't think Dunne can stay functional for long enough. At this stage Ehmer should be making up the numbers.

Hopefully Phillips stays. I'd spend the entirety of the Summer training sessions converting Traoré into a left-winger. I'd keep Henry for the middle, but I have my doubts about him being the charismatic leader to bark at people from the midfield. Not sure what you'd do about Barton. No-one will offer him wages close to anything like he's getting right now. He's just had a house built in Richmond, has a lot of media activities and is doing his degree. He'd probably be down for hanging around locally, so there might be a deal to be had. It largely depends on who the manager will be though - with Barton you'll always be on the lookout for a personality clash. Doughty and maybe Manning can make up the numbers. It would be nice to have Faurlin back for another season but I don't think the club is in a position to be rolling out pity contracts any more, so it would have to be for a Faurlin who can contribute.

Third season on the trot that we'll be in urgent need of extra firepower!

I think as a Championship club we'll lose leverage on attracting players from abroad. Depending on who comes in, we might be leaning on old relationships for a lot of loans. I just hope they source the right ones this time.",470,2015-03-15

superhoops,"I think when it came to the crunch, Clement would run a mile. He's spent the last few years essentially following Ancelotti around some clubs that are considerably more infrastructurally blessed than QPR (Google images of Real Madrid's training ground and cry). There's also the impending financial mystery and the complete squad overhaul necessary. I'm not sure what their plans are - will Ferdinand assemble the essentials of a squad himself? Will they allow whoever comes in a few additions of their own? I'd say they're more likely to bring in someone with off-the-shelf relationships that they can call upon to quickly flesh out the squad. I hated that about Harry, but this time it looks like it might be a necessary evil. I just hope they find someone they actually want, as opposed to having to take on whomever would actually take the job.

* Get Vargas back in at RM, depending if we have a better option than Phillips at LM.  Also, chemistry between Isla and Vargas on the right adds more quality to that side than Isla and Phillips.  I have no idea if Vargas is injured or not but he has been unjustly removed from the starting XI.
* Phillips is less effective at LM than RM but it has been working so far and his defensive cover has helped Yun.  Our only other options at LM are Hoilett and Traore who have not been particularly effective.
* Replace Henry with Barton. I'm sure this was bound to happen anyway but will improve the quality of the midfield.
* Get Taarabt off the pitch, leave in Zamora and Austin up front.  At least we know the type of performance we will get out of Zamora, less so with Taarabt, I don't care if he can *change* a game.
* If we can get Dunne and/or Fer back before the end of the season, this will improve us as well.

superhoops,"I occasionally have some access to information from inside the QPR camp. This info' is from a conversation after the Palace game:

**Confidence**

Player confidence is at an extreme low - at least one first 11 player questions whether they are up to the standard required of the PL. ""We keep getting overrun"" is a phrase that's used.

**Factions remain in the camp**

There are a group of approximately 6 players who do not train with the bulk of the team (do not adhere to the main training regime). This group includes 2 of the usual suspects and some of our most experienced stalwarts, who feel they know better- The likes of SWP and Taarabt are laws unto themselves.

**Training/Coaching methods**

This was highlighted as the most important factor in our under performance. We have inherited Harry's training approach, which has changed little in style since the 1990's.
If you look at the likes of Mourhino and other elite team managers and their coaching staff, they make notes during  games - they are writing down player names and the minute of the game that player makes a mistake. They then use that information to coach the mistake out of the player. Allegedly modern techniques like this are not used at QPR and haven't been, at least since Harry started with us. 

We have the same coaching staff as under Harry, senior players are having trouble respecting the training techniques being used. The brief honeymoon period under Ramsey is long over.

**The £60m write-off**

It's not expected the FA will allow that money to be written off, meaning we are likely to see lengthy legal proceedings between QPR and the FA, should we go down this season.

**Conclusion**

Perhaps none of this tells us anything we didn't already know. What did make an impression on me is the very low self-confidence of the team, their apparent acceptance that we are relegated and the overriding dissatisfaction with the way things are being done at QPR - it is not felt we are a viable Premier League club.

NB: It should be noted that this was feedback on Saturday evening, after we'd been thumped by Palace.

-----------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I'm sorry it sounds so gloomy. It's worth remembering that the above issues are not really new to the club and were likely affected by Saturday's defeat in the telling.

superhoops,"I think it's too late unfortunately mate! You raise some good points, but Ramsey doesn't seem to favour Vargas. I'd leave Henry in there if I could, I think a good course of action could be a 3 man mid of Barton, Henry and Sandro. The players seem consigned to relegation now. No fight. Wrong manager.

superhoops,"Survival now would be an epic feat. The time for playing for draws is over, so playing Isla at rightback with a remit to attack whenever possible sounds good to me. I'd love to have him and Vargas playing like they were earlier in the season.

I think our problems are compounded by the imminent departure of a lot of these guys though - look at some of the names listed here...Isla, Vargas, Zamora, Barton, ~~Zamora~~, even Austin. They're all gone in two months' time.",85,2015-03-16
superhoops,"I've kinda changed my mind, at first I welcomed youth players but given the situation we can't be experimenting and Furlong so far has been poor, he needs experience but it's not the right time to give it to him. The fact is we were a better team with some players out of their usual position. Vargas over SWP definitely. Our defence is poor, especially without Dunne but Isla should be more useful then Furlong.

I feel the players don't really care anymore, they see relegation as inevitable. Charlie knows he'll be going to a bigger club in the summer.",100,2015-03-16
superhoops,"Can't help but feel we are still feeling the after-effects of Mark Hughes's tenure. I feel sorry for Ramsey, this is such a tough ask for him. I see absolutely zero possibility for us to stay up because we are just so, so poor. Unlike Burnley, I can't ever see us going on a run, I can never see us picking up points against the big teams. What I'd like to do now is try to enjoy the time we have left but that's hard enough. 

I've always been a big fan of Tony Fernandes, but it's starting to dawn on me that he is the problem with QPR. I love the guy, I really do, but his naivety and financial mishaps have been damaging. He either backs his manager blindly or gives into rash decisions. IMHO, the only way we're going to move forward, as much as it pains me to say, is when he leaves, which I have a strange feeling will be sooner rather than later.

The only way we could have stayed up was if Tony backed Harry in the transfer window. You might argue that Harry's signed a few duds but he's also made some great signings for us as well. The Zarate thing has really summed up our season - it's a mess.

Thanks for the post, interesting info.",225,2015-03-16
superhoops,"Jesus, not more factionalism? Man-children. No time for those clowns. The sooner they are out of the club the better. It reminds me of a report I saw last season where someone had got tickets for the exec suites to watch a match at Loftus Road, and one of the areas had a sign indicating it was booked by SWP Productions or some nonsensical name - SWP had booked it for a few of the players who weren't involved. Traoré was one of his guests.

I can't believe that this far into the Fernandes era, we still haven't got someone with a spine going on the warpath to straighten some of these scumbags out. It's insane. Utterly insane.

If the confidence of the remaining players is indeed that low, then that might be what kills us of completely (as if we're not already dead and buried). On BT Sport last night Barton was on the panel of pundits prior to the Marseille-Lyon game and he looked pretty gloomy.",168,2015-03-16
superhoops,"Good read, thanks for posting. 

At this point I'm almost welcoming relegation simply because we'll have a chance to really rebuild this time. This season should have righted all the wrongs from the Hughes tenure and helped us to establish back in the premier league. Instead we've seen the same naivety and poor decisions that blighted our last final season in the prem. the worst of all is that this just seems so typical of being a qpr fan.

I love him as a player and, considering he's already 25, if he were to stay with us into the championship he may never reach his full potential, he has the opportunity to go into a top half club with far better delivery then ours, hopefully he can then continue to score goals and make the national team. Additionally, the team has been too reliant on him this season, we need to rebuild and create a team capable of scoring goals without passing to a certain player and hoping for the best, Charlie's scored nearly half our goals which is far too much especially when we're playing two strikers. Finally, he won't go cheap and we'll make a decent profit on him which will help us rebuild the team, something I'm hoping whoever the new manager is will be keen to do.

It legitimised some decisions which would later turn out to be naive. Sure, I'm all for youth, but Furlong was a huge mistake in the Palace game.

I'm not SWP advocate at all - far, far from it - but to me bringing him in from the cold one week then dropping him entirely shows he doesn't know what he's doing.

Sunday was our moment, given the other results that weekend. And we fluffed it; our line-up and tactics were taken to pieces.

But, and this is where it gets devious.  Do we have a chance?  Is there any hope left to cling to?

Let us peer into history.

In 2002/2003, relegation threatened Bolton Wanderers took 15 points out of their remaining 8 fixtures and finished 17th with 44 points, 2 points above safety.

In 2005/2006, Portsmouth was in a similar position to us, sitting at 24 points in 17th place.  In their last 8 fixtures they managed to scrape together 14 points, finishing in 17th place with 38.

In 2006/2007, West Ham made a miraculous recovery in their last 8 fixtures.  Tumbling to 18th in the table on a meager 23 points, West Ham won 6 of their last 8 fixtures coming out with 18 points and finished safely in 15th position.

In 2011/2012, Wigan made a similarly astounding recovery.  Winning 6 of their last 8, ascending from 18th to a comfortable 15th by the end of the season.

So, in the last 15 years there have been four occurrences of teams that have saved themselves from relegation with just 8 fixtures remaining.

So you are saying there is a chance.

It also sets a solid platform allowing us to bring on Hoilett if we need to change the game in the 2nd half.

Plus if Villa try to use Weimann and Agbonlahor's pace against Clint on our left, we'll need Traore there to counter it.",80,2015-04-06
superhoops,"Usually he's quite poor and makes a number of mistakes, but against West Brom he was our strongest defender (Made as many clearances as the rest of the back four put together). One of our main defensive weaknesses is the failure to win headers in the box, Onouha tends to just watch the ball until it's too late, but I think this is something Caulker's strong at. If he performs as he did against West Brom, then he'll deserve praise but defending will be difficult especially with Clint Hill around. My optimism for the Villa game is damaged, but I'm still hopefull and if the players share my enthusiam we should at least put up a fight. Considering the outstanding goals our side our capable of scoring, I'd love to see a large number of shots from our side.

",139,2015-04-06
superhoops,"Traore seems like a perfect fit on the left side. He can run all day, and has the ability to help defensively. Although not the greatest player by any stretch of the imagination, he should provide more defensive pressure on the left to help Hill out.",46,2015-04-06
superhoops,I think he has done a solid job for us this season.  Don't disagree that he has made mistakes but everyone has in honesty. I really enjoy he and Onuoha's partnership. ,31,2015-04-06
superhoops,"Besides a few strong performances, I think he has been poor this year. He shows promise and is still young but is lost on the pitch at times, and out of position more often than not. 

I think his best attributes would be tackling and shotblocking, but half the time it seems he is just cleaning up his own mess. 

I'm not bashing him and saying sell him or anything like that obviously, and I understand he's had to deal with 3 different CB partners and a couple of formation changes; 

I honestly just want to hear peoples opinions on him. ",101,2015-04-06
superhoops,"I think he is the one of the first names on the team sheet behind Austin and Greeno (obviously) and that must mean something. He makes a fair few mistakes, but i am certain that if it weren't for him, we would be conceding a tonne more goals. I really like to think that he is taking note of the aerial abilities of both Hill and Dunne, whilst maintaining the composure of Rio. He has a lot to learn, but it is comforting when i see his name on the starting squad.",92,2015-04-06
superhoops,"Our weak link in defence, and one of our least talked about problems unfortunately. Frequently makes costly errors. Hopefully we'll only have to make a small loss on him if we were to go down, as I imagine most clubs will be swayed by the fact that he's a young English CB without taking into account his errors this season. ",60,2015-04-06
superhoops,"From this season it's clear scoring first is vital, I can't remember a game where we've scored first and lost (sure there's at least one). West Brom is a great example of how important that early first goal was to our morale and it'll equally lower that of the Villa players. We all know how vital a win is tomorrow, and despite some crushing injuries it's definitely a winnable game. 

With Vargas and Yun out, we'll need two different players on the left and with Hill probably in the squad I'd hope we stick someone capable of defending with him. As I've said before the players can't be afraid to shoot, just look at Bobby's and Vargas's goals against West Brom and you'll see why these risks are important. Winning headers in our box is also important and something we're consistently weak at. ",143,2015-04-06
superhoops,"I'd try that 3-5-2 from the get go against Chelsea, with instructions to play conservatively. I'd test the waters first to see what kind of Chelsea we're up against, and if they are looking a bit too threatening hang back and play for the point, whilst hoping that we come out at the other end only 3 points away from Villa or Hull.

West Ham, on the other hand, is, once again, a real must win. Lamentably I'll be away, missing my first QPR competitive home fixture since August 2013. It might be a small mercy though...if we lose that on top of the Chelsea match, that could be the end.

I'm still not confident on the whole. There are so many things that can go wrong even against the 'weaker' teams lined up, in terms of mistakes from players with extensive records of screw-ups, getting burned for pace at the back, not providing enough opportunities for Austin, Zamora having an anonymous day, etc. etc. However last night's Phillips to Austin goal was definitely a spark of optimism...if they can close out the season with a productive partnership, who knows what could happen?",193,2015-04-07
superhoops,"Hmm, Kranjcar and Hill on one side.",7,2015-04-07
superhoops,"A shame that Vargas is out for the rest of the season and hope we don't struggle without him. We need Phillips and Austin to play out of their skin tonight and if we win...then we have a fairly good chance of survival. 

God knows my Wednesday mood is going to hinge on this tonight.

Burnley have some tough fixtures coming up and hull have a very formidable run-in.

Unfortunately still not holding my breath for safety at this point though. ",66,2015-04-07
superhoops,"A draw isn't going to be enough - in the context of the season we need 3 points tonight. I hope that Ramsey doesn't start the game in an overly attacking formation though. We should leave Taarabt and Hoilett on the bench and bring in Traore for Vargas. That'll give us solidity, speed on the wings, and good crossers of the ball to provide chances for Bobby and Charlie. Keep it tight, keep a clean sheet, and if we still haven't scored after an hour we've got options to come off the bench and throw everything at them. 

We don't need to win 4-1; just a clean sheet and Charlie nipping in at the near post to convert a Matty Phillips cross will do nicely!",125,2015-04-07
superhoops,"On the basis of what I just watched, Traoré > Kranjcar. Not sure if that's a repeatable observation though.",19,2015-04-07
superhoops,"I'd say the 4 points in two games is massive for us. Burnley play Arsenal next and the others also have difficult fixtures which means we shouldn't be too threatened - A win against Chelsea will take us into like 15th, and I'm sure we can win against West Ham (Especially with Fer and Dunne back). Newcastle and Leicester are definitely winnable fixtures. Both Liverpool and Man City have been in weak form, and hopefully our new away form will continue there. We can take 9 points from our remaining games at least.",93,2015-04-07
superhoops,"Good for him, you can tell a lot of analysts only watch the highlights and judge our performance purely off the score line. Remember reading a guardian article saying the West Brom game would be an opportunity for QPR to see what they missed out on by not getting Tony Pulis, a terrible prediction.",54,2015-04-07

One of the good things about the last game is that several of our players scored, increasing confidence all round. I'd like to think Barton's goal helps silence a few of his demons for a few games,  improving his performance even further. If Sandro  also stays in 1 piece and we don't lose anymore defenders, we have a chance. Let's see how Clint manages at left-back ",80,2015-04-07

Fantastic to see Hill scoring. Seeing him point to the badge like that made my evening. Love the guy. So glad he's finally got his first EPL goal, but it should really be his second.

Unless Sandro was injured I thought bringing Doughty on for him was one of those youthful substitutions that was typical of Ramsey. Sandro was doing fine. I can't comment with certainty on the point as I know Sandro has only been able to play up to an hour lately but Hoilett would have been an ideal sub to bring on. 

I'm worried about our prospects because we've blown it far too many times as far as I'm concerned. Swansea, Everton, Hull, Hull again... The list goes on. I'm not sure where these performances have been but this could be too little too late. Is 4 points enough from our last 2 games? I'm not sure. At the very least we could be playing City and Liverpool at the right time.

superhoops,"The key to this game will be the atmosphere, especially getting Remy off his game, which I think we can accomplish.

As far as our lineup goes if Yun is not available Clint Hill will likely feature at left back.  Hill puts in a shift and covers well at LB but against top opposition like Chelsea I'm afraid he could struggle.  We really need to get Yun back.  The next question is whether Dunne makes an immediate return to the starting XI.  I don't think Caulker has done enough wrong to lose his starting spot and I also believe that Chelsea would find a way to exploit two 34+ defenders.  On the right side Isla is an obvious lock.  Isla is competent at right back but against top opposition, as we saw with Lukaku, he will get exploited.  Everytime I talk about the right back position all I can think about is why did we sell Danny Simpson...

In the midfield, Sandro, Barton and Phillips are obvious.  Our only concern is left midfielder.  I say we start Traoré.  He has proven defensive qualities as well as pace and proved a nuisance against Villa.  Both Kranjcar and Hoilett have started the position but neither have made it their own.  It is quite late in the season to be giving out opportunities at any position but if Traoré can go on a run of good form and transform our left wing the same way Phillips has the right, then by all means give him the opportunity.

Interestingly, I feel like Ramsey has been purposely vague about which players are fit and which are not, in an attempt to throw off Mourinho and his strategy going into the game.

superhoops,"I'll say they deserved a draw, not a win.  But that says something about the team and the Manager.  They might have won if one of those attempts on target had been to a spot where the keeper wasn't, but Courtois had a ""pretty good game"".

I'll admit that I was quick to blame Rob Green for a poor kick, but the reality is that he did get the ball up and away from the box, not straight to an opposing player who tapped it in.  Not his best moment, but he goal could have been prevented.  I think we have to admit it was a great setup and finish for the goal.  

If only our strikers could have converted a few opportunities...
",123,2015-04-12
superhoops,"Aside from the idiots lobbing lighters and programmes at the celebrating Chelsea players, I thought the supporters were superb today and lived up to what was expected of them. It kinda makes me wonder why they can't recreate that on a more regular basis. I think pumping in with that level of noise and passion against some of the other teams we played at Loftus Road, we might have swayed things a bit for a point or two more.

Rob Green has pulled off some amazing shot stops over the course of the season, but as I mentioned on the other thread his distribution is just so sketchy. I thought the midfield were ok today in challenging in the air, but there have been other times when I wished Green could put it out with a little bit more finesse. Not sure if there is any truth in [the stat that I've just seen, but here it is...](https://twitter.com/Squawka/status/587380484675518465)

Edit: But I don't want to be overly harsh on Green. In the catalogue of mistakes this season, there have been costlier ones: Austin's missed penalty against Hull, Vargas' conceding the penalty at Stamford Bridge, Traoré and Yun switching off when Sterling took his free kick against Liverpool, Barton red card at Hull...

I'm a tad concerned over what McCarthy will do in the summer. Another year sat on his arse might not be what he was expecting here. 

I don't think we were helped in our very limited options from the bench. When you have to have three kids who haven't even been out on loan dressed and ready, you know you've got problems.

Warming to Ramsey again after the last few performances after the bizarre decision to roll SWP out for a game. We have a nice storyline coming up with him I guess, because I'm pretty sure there's a job waiting for him at Villa if he wants it.

superhoops,"We really did deserve a win today, kind of sickening how they managed to score with their first shot in target.

Whilst there's was a lot of excitement about Green in our last few games he's been considerably poor. Defensively we did well apart from slipping up at the end. I'd argue that this has been the same story over the last few home defeats, whilst we let goals in we've usually come back and be unlucky not to receive a draw... Today we failed to take our chances (not helped by them having an amazing keeper), but there are positive to take from the match and if we continue to perform like we did today we can surely beat some of our remaining teams.

superhoops,"I think that ""big"" is too much of a generalization.

I want to see us grow but in a way more similar to Swansea or Southampton.  In fact I think we should aspire to the likes of Southampton, who have improved as a club in a drastic and inspiring sense.  I do not want us to grow off the back of a billionaire owner who purchases talent instead of cultivating it.

In the past 3-4 years we have operated similarly to a misfiring engine.  I feel as though Fernandes has truly appreciated the nature of his mistakes and is now building a proper framework for a fiscally responsible, well-performing football club.

As far as getting in the right people, which is the first step as Fernandes has previously stated, we are on the right track.  It was not long ago that we were presented with a writeup on the absolute farce that our training staff had devolved into after the appointment of our new owners (prior to Fernandes).  Next up is a proper training facility, one that empowers youth talent to step up and succeed.  If you refer to a recent interview with three of our prospective youth talents, they each possess a fantastic work ethic and understand the value of, ""work hard and you will be rewarded.""

The togetherness of the squad, compared to two years ago at this time, is not even comparable.  These players are fighting for their lives in the Premier League, whereas the squad of two years ago were simply collecting wages.  As much as Redknapp contributed to our fiscally precarious situation he also united the team as a brilliant man manager.  Ramsey, thankfully, has inherited a spirited squad and barring a few questionable team decisions has had a massively positive impact on our form and consistency.  The overall fitness of the team has improved under Ramsey and that is a direct result of his modern training methods.

I see improvement on the pitch, in the back office, and at the youth levels.  Through improvement will come growth but it will be the type of growth that we should embrace.   If this growth one day results in QPR being a big club, then I will embrace it as such.",374,2015-04-13
superhoops,"Sheer capacity limitation means that there were less than 2000 Chelsea fans in attendance yesterday, so I'd wager that a lot of what you've read is from very superficial ideas of what QPR fans were like yesterday. They probably omitted to mention the nice rally of to-and-fro chanting in the first half, which began with ""Terry, you're a cunt"", progressed to ""John Terry, he's won more than you"", which was then met with a double strike of ""You're mum is a thief"" and ""John, Terry, We know what you are"" (i.e. a racist) from QPR, which elicited a final, classy response of ""We know what you are, Anton Ferdinand, we know what you are"" (i.e. what Terry called him at the time) from them. Throwing stuff at the players isn't cool, but the verbals dished out to the team and their fans were all fair game in my opinion, and any Chelsea fan who thinks their travelling supporters were any better is very mistaken.

As for becoming a big club, a little bit bigger wouldn't hurt. Fulham showed that there is scope to grow quite nicely over the course of a decade or so. I still think QPR is well placed to serve a respectable slice of West London's population. I saw a Labour Party activist report back from a local meeting at Ealing Council (an administrative division of London) that two alternative sites for a new stadium have been proposed in Park Royal and Greenford. This would probably allow for more modest, realistic growth nested within suburban areas of the city from which to attract fresh supporters. I doubt at this stage that QPR will ever reach the aspirations of Fernandes and co., which is probably a good thing. I think the club should primarily be a communal expression of West London, with the added benefit of being just big enough to have loyal support from all over the place on the side. They probably need to do something to recreate the magic that attracted so many Scandinavian supporters in the '80s, for example. Chelsea, Arsenal, Man U, even Liverpool...to be honest you could have these teams play an entire season's home games abroad and [they'd probably sell out comfortably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4l4kOhdWFc).

Stadium size also matters. Around two years ago I went to see Dortmund in their cavernous 80k ground. My overriding feeling was that it's too big. They can create a massive tifo that looks impressive, but I'm not sure it compares to a sold out allocation at Millwall pumping out ""no-one likes you, cause you're shit"". I'll also confess I came away from the home playoff leg against Wigan feeling more exhilarated than Wembley. Wembley served up an incredible wall of sound after the Zamora goal, but it didn't match the intimacy and accoustics of Loftus Road. If they do manage to build something new, I hope they maintain the shoebox style.",483,2015-04-13

Would stick Leicester back at the bottom (assuming we win) and leave us ahead of Burnley. However, with sunderland hopefully losing tomorrow a win for us and Leicester would take both teams out the relegation zone, however it'd give Leicester a bit of breathing space with 31 points... We need them staying in the battle.

A win tomorrow could put us into 16th place, sticking both Hull and Sunderland into the relegation zone!

Few expect us to get points from City or Liverpool, so lets look at our relegation rivals fixtures;

Sunderland - Southampton and Everton, think they'll lose both.

Leicester - Chelsea and Newcastle, with a game in hand I see them beating Newcastle but not Chelsea.

Hull - Liverpool and Arsenal, home fixtures but I think they should lose both, they've also got a few in shorter time frame.

Burnley - Hull and West Ham, I see them winning both.

We have to remember that some teams have played fewer games, Hull and Leicester however I fancy our odds of not falling too far behind from the two games after West Ham, but tomorrow is a definite must win if we're to survive.

I wouldn't mind a while with him, a season in the Championship with Ramsey at the head could give us a very solid base for future success.

Best case scenario, and mathematically very unlikely, we stay up, keep players, put in some solid training in the break, end up with a proper playing strategy and a team that gels together, keeps the ball, defends well, attacks efficiently, and is generally as good as we can be.

If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.

superhoops,"Excellent summary.

Assuming any potential fine will not be counted against the club in its presentation of yearly accounts for FFP compliance checking, based on last years accounts ([page 15, £38mn revenue with parachute](http://www.scribd.com/doc/258474746/QPR-Holdings-limited-2014)) we should be looking at a combined transfer and wage spend of around £40-50 million, while the parachute payments are in place. That's actually not that bad considering the parachute payments are largely in place to cover expenses clubs are lumbered with following relegation - we're in this weird situation where a lot of the high earners are on their way out. The only headaches I can imagine are Onuoha, Hoilett, Caulker, Taarabt, Traoré and Sandro. Depressingly, given the timing of their signings, their pedigree (deserved or not) and their previous clubs, I can envisage this lot collectively costing upwards of 200k a week. That's a quarter of the hypothetical budget up in smoke right there.

I don't think we can be hit with an embargo on top of a fine, thankfully. If even such a thing were to happen, they'd have to bend the rules to allow us to actually build a team.

>Acquiring players for salaries >£15k per week.

First things first - they need to act quick to settle their new manager/head coach into the position. That man then needs to sit down with Ferdinand, and come up with a plan A and a plan B and then hit the market and buy accordingly. I wouldn't be going for a premium striker purchase like Fulham made with McCormack, I'd be looking to bring in a second striker from a Championship club and pitch him a deal as the number one choice up top. I'd probably set aside a larger chunk of the transfer kitty for this. I'd look to buy/sign the rest in from anywhere from League One to the Scottish Championship.

The next larger transfer fee I'd set aside is for a captain. Probably a central defender or holding midfielder. None of the retained players will be up to the job - we've seen that they just aren't talkers. Someone needs to be barking out orders to the defense or midfield.

For the rest I'm imagining a lot of cheap-ish unattached players signing.

>Competing in the Championship against clubs that are executing well-developed long-term plans.

This is why I don't think we'll be competing for any honours next year. This year's Championship was intense stuff, with the top 8 teams playing for something down to the wire. On top of that, Burnley are going down with loads of money. Even Wolves are still due a final parachute payment. Then you're bumping up against the simple fact that most of the teams are bigger than us.

I'm actually more excited by the QPR narrative than I have been in a while now.",469,2015-05-11
superhoops,"I think you're spot on, though the fine may be a tad larger. 

If we do face a transfer embargo, can we still sign players on a free? 

I do think in the utter worst case scenario, we end up like Blackpool, cobbling a team together last minute and getting spanked out the league - but with boat loads more debt.

Plus side, I think some youth players will be given a chance, i.e. Petrasso, Manning, Grego-Cox, Donaldson, Furlong and Mulraney, so we get to see if they'll pan out! 

But I do think we'll be lucky to be mid table next season. ",103,2015-05-11
superhoops,"Though it's mostly bad news, somehow reading this makes me feel happier about the future of the club. Most of what we'll lose over the coming months needs to be lost. Many of those high-salary players who are staying either have resale value or could be good performers in the Championship. I don't reckon we'll get £30mill from player sales this summer though. 

Personally I'd like to see Ramsey stay at the club, but if a top manager is available we should attempt to sign him. I would include Warnock in that bracket. As has been pointed out here, it will now get much harder to attract players with our damaged reputation and low salary offers; having a proven manager would help immeasurably. We will soon need to replace a lot of players, and the kind of signings we need are in the Warnock mould (Clint Hill for next to nothing, Jamie Mackie for £500k, etc). Come to think of it, Mackie isn't up to much these days - sign him up!",172,2015-05-11

The damage Mark Hughes did to the club must always be borne in mind. Redknapp did a good job of clearing the deadwood but the Warnock and Hughes signings are still here. 

If Redknapp was backed in January I believe we would have stayed up. The way the owners kept tight fisted with their funds can only suggest the possibility of going down did not frighten them. It was risky. If we are going to get this fine then why not let Harry give it his all to keep us up? 

Ramsey is not the guy to take us forward. ",132,2015-05-11
superhoops,"Please take my comments at face value, or don't take them at all because I'm:
A) American (yikes) and
B) Only been following the Premier League for two years,
but QPR's largest issues this year was too lofty of goals, no pun intended. They finished last season in the Championship disappointingly, as with the quality of team they had comparative to the rest of the league there's no reason in my opinion that they should have not been crowned champs. But they weren't. They didn't even gain auto promotion, and frankly, if Zamora doesn't net that 90' header to seal the deal, I think Derby would've won in extra time. But anyway, Harry Redknapp tried to employ a Tottenham style of football at QPR, and while it clearly benefited Charlie Austin, his back four was left hanging, due to so many men committed forward. And as a result the goals came in a flurry, and so did the losses.
Going forward, where is the state of QPR? Well, if the board stays with Ramsey and forks over the fair-play fine, in great shape. Due to being way out of market I only saw the R's twice all year, against the Champions at Loftus Road and MC at the Etihad, both defeats. But the difference in those games is when they came in the year. For 86 or so minutes, QPR had Mo and Chelsea nervous. They were flying up the pitch, making Courtois work for every euro he makes, and it was only because of the Fabregas goal that all their momentum was killed. But that QPR team wasn't the one that played yesterday against City. No, the team that hit the pitch yesterday almost appeared like they wanted to get relegated. There was no energy going forward, the back four was a revolving door, constantly spinning around to chase Aguero as he torched them.
Again, I'm not trying to bash Rangers, I'm just a tad disappointed. This was a Rangers team I thought was going to finish at best mid-table, realistically about 14 or 15. Instead with 2 games to go they'll probably finish at the foot. Ramsey will produce young talent going forward, he did wonders for Tottenham's youth academy, (my example I'm thinking of is Harry Kane) and I believe they'll be top flight soon. In the meantime, if you want to loan and/or transfer Charlie Austin, as a fan of Crystal Palace we'll gladly take him.",410,2015-05-11

superhoops,"Yesterday the board issued a statement, committing to the club for the short-, medium- and long-term. 

I've been considering our situation. The following summarises my thoughts...

**Positives**

* Likely revenue from selling players this summer: £25-30m.
* Parachute payments: ~£60m over 4  years.
* We are about to lose several high salary players, eg: Barton, SWP.
* Les Ferdinand is a football person and so we likely have a more appropriate plan from now on.
* If we are to have a new focus on youth, Ramsey is ideal if he remains 1st team coach.

**Negatives**

* We are about to lose most of our first eleven.
* The perception of QPR, inside football, has been seriously damaged over the past 8 years.
* Loftus road generates low gate revenues.
* We likely still have some high-salary players (eg: Onuoha, Hoilett, Caulker, Taarabt, Traoré and Sandro).
* The club does not have a developed scouting network.
* Many of our best youth players left the club, due to a lack of first team opportunities and mismanagement of the youth academy. 
* The club is over £200m in debt.
* We may face a &gt;£57m fine from the FA.
* We may face a transfer embargo from the FA.

**Our main challenges**

* Acquiring players for salaries &gt;£15k per week.
* Enticing players away from other offers, to take a risk at QPR, despite our reputation.
* Competing in the Championship against clubs that are executing well-developed long-term plans.
* Staying in the Championship - It is not too pessimistic to anticipate League 1 football in the 2016/17 season.

It is wise to prepare ourselves, as fans, for a few seasons of rebuilding at QPR. We are almost starting with a blank slate; albeit with an extreme level of debt. We will need the board's ongoing commitment while hoping their business interests continue to do well.

superhoops,Another typical Fernandes move. When we're not getting bailed by world class goals out of nothing next season as we were this year he will realise what a mistake this was.

superhoops,"The great news is that he's got all summer to assemble a squad to take on the Championship. Hopefully he'll have some signing targets in mind and we can get deals done quickly - including players who'll move from the club: we can do without a replay of the Remy situation late in the transfer window. 

The bad news is that he's relatively inexperienced, therefore might not be recognisable to players we approach and from the look of things he won't be signing the players with Sir Les taking the Director of Football role. Will they both agree on targets or will TF have the final say? I like that he has a background with youth development but honestly, will that track record reap rewards next season or five years from now?",132,2015-05-19

superhoops,"Perhaps one of Fernandes' biggest failures this season was not having the balls to knife Redknapp in the back early enough. Trouble is it was such a house of cards with Redknapp's players in the squad that it might have been too risky a move. I wonder how much of a feel Fernandes had for what the mood was around the place - how well informed can he have been when he was so far away so often?

I pity him to some extent though. It reached the point a while ago where the chaos was all knotted together to the point that any decision could have had a negative outcome somewhere else. New era now though, new CEO, Ferdinand era and Ramsey from scratch. Maybe this time?",128,2015-05-25
superhoops,i dont blame Vargas at all! getting benched for the likes of someone like SWP then being asked to come on for him when we were 3-0 down. as for isla he follows his buddy.,35,2015-05-25
superhoops,"The Vargas thing is true as the club confirmed the two weeks wages fine. On the surface it looks like the string of stories that week were a co-ordinated, self-defensive leak to a journalist close to Ramsey. ""We're going down, but look at the shit I'm working with"" kinda thing.",50,2015-05-25
superhoops,"For me,  both of them seemed to have immense work rates and I thought they were good signings. They were better at the start of the season,  but it's possible that Ramsey didn't like them because he said a while back that he will only pick those who train hard, so it's likely they were quite lazy in training. As for vargas refusing to come on - I could probably see why; losing 3-1 to palace when he could be back playing in the europa league,  but it was unacceptable and I'm glad that Ramsey gave him the boot. ",99,2015-05-25
superhoops,"It is a difficult prediction given the uncertainty of our current circumstances. Are we going to get fined? How much? Who stays, who goes? What formation, youth and coaching style are we going to play?

Frankly, we don't really know how good of a coach Ramsey is. He has had limited players, limited tactics and has had to pick up a team that was (and still is) in shambles. For all i know Ramsey likes to play a 5-3-2 or 4-1-2-1-2. The fact being that now he has an opportunity to select his players, and build a team that he wants. In hindsight, as much as i like Ramsey as a person, someone who has experience has a great opportunity to build a team from a clean slate.",128,2015-05-25
superhoops,"I don't think that TF can afford a relegation scrap, nor a long stint in the Championship. I think we'll be mid table, with a possibility to overspend the next summer to get us back up if we haven't made any progress. I don't see TF standing back for too long. 

Unless, OOC speeds up, in which case I can see TF sit back for a while, as that will generate a fair few quid. In this scenario we may have more time to 'build' the right way. But overall, I'm starting to worry about the stewardship of the club under TF. Too much debt, fuck all to show for it. ",111,2015-05-25
superhoops,"I think we'll be okay. I don't believe we'll be in a relegation fight,  but I we'll be a solid bottom half team for a few years, much like we were before we ever came up. 
Austin has said he doesn't mind staying,  but if he does I reckon we can get ~15 million for him. We could probably scrape another 15 from selling sandro fer and caulker ,  which is effectively half our fine.  as for transfers,  les ferdinand says he has a list of lower league players which he is after, so hopefully some good can come from there. 
Ramsey certainly wasn't my first choice as manager,  I'd have much preferred mark Warburton,  but he's here now and we'll have to make do with it. When he first took over the players looked really motivated and wanted to play. The only things I worry about are his tactics and whether the players respect him a lot - see caulker,  vargas etc. What I think we need is to get rid of bond and get a tactical,  fearsome assistant,  eg roy Keane,  possibly hill if he retires. 
Rgc looked more than comfortable against Newcastle and looks as if he will be a good striker in the championship. Apparently comley played well yesterday too,  and doughty, furlong and Mccarthy all seem like good prospects and should be able to do well in a lower league ",235,2015-05-25

superhoops,"It's not just you, but the issue is now not to do with managers.

The club is in a far worse mess than can be seen at first glance.

Any managers we take on over the next 2 seasons are potential cannon fodder for the fans,  there to take the heat until such time as the club reinvents itself.

It's unlikely we have many hidden wonder kids in the development squad, any significant talent left.

superhoops,"Seen the Chilean boys cop a bit of stick here. I read the rumour about Vargas not wanting to come off the bench a few weeks back, is that generally accepted as being truthful? Is there anything else that's been accepted as going on behind the scenes, and what has Isla done?",52,2015-05-25
superhoops,"I've seen a fair few people saying they aren't renewing their season tickets for the first time in years. Two years ago after relegation the club was pointing to the fastest season ticket sales on record. Barring some very generous pricing, I can't see that happening again, and I wonder whether some supporters have just had enough. A lot of people make a lot of effort to support the club, and after the last four years you can't blame them for voting with their feet.

Even if they recruit well, I don't know how easy it is to incubate team spirit, familiarity, tactics etc in a short space of time. I can picture decent effort on the pitch from honest pros signed with good intentions, regularly losing matches on individual moments of communications breakdown, or pure cohesion of opposition play.

If QPR's professional reputation in the industry is going to be rebuilt then they will have to sail away from the scum who lumbered us with so many players that made us appreciate the likes of Hill, Faurlin and Mackie even more. They need to recruit from different talent pools entirely, and there is of course a question mark over how much experience they have in this area.

I can't find any indication of what kind of tactical record Ramsey has outside of QPR. His Charleston battery squad won a championship in 2003, but there doesn't seem to be a lot documented.

Pessimistically, more Spurs finger prints all over the squad for the fourth year running.

For any of you guys from abroad somehow tempted to make the trip to see QPR next season, I recommend targeting the Brentford match.",280,2015-05-25
superhoops,"I know it's early days, but I'm eager to put this season behind us and start thinking for the future. 

I think even without the fine, we are going to struggle in the bottom half of the table if we keep moving in this direction, we are going to lose the players who have been able to bail us out. With the fine or any transfer embargoes, I see us in a relegation fight. I've said this before but I don't think Ramsey is the right man for the job and I certainly can't see TF successfully repealing the fine given his track record of negotiation and promises he hasn't followed through with.

But the last time we went down we were inexplicably favourites to go back up, so perhaps we might fare a bit better than that. 

I don't think Liverpool will sell Sterling, so unfortunately we will miss out on the 20% of his fee, however I can see us fetching 25M in transfer fees in the summer. 

I'm encouraged by the new shift of focus on youth, but I don't think the right people are in place to implement it - from top to bottom. 

I can see us really struggling next year, and predict we won't finish any higher than 10th, with a real possibility of a relegation scrap if we're not careful.  ",227,2015-05-25

superhoops,"In the 2013/14 season:
> *What has really destroyed QPR’s finances is their unbelievable wage bill. Whichever way you look at this, it is fairly appalling. After promotion in 2012 it nearly doubled from £30 million to £58 million and then rose again the following season to £78 million. In the last four seasons the headcount has exploded from 104 to 169, including a 43 increase in the number of players, managers and coaches from 69 to 112.*

> *Despite relegation the wage bill was only trimmed by £2.6 million (3%) from £78 million to £75.4 million, increasing the wages to turnover ratio from 129% to an almost unimaginable 195%.

The Mariners Trust launched Operation Promotion on 1 June with the aim of boosting Paul Hurst’s (Our manager) transfer kitty for next season. The plan was to raise £20,000 in eight weeks with all proceeds raised added into Hurst’s existing budget for the Mariners’ 2015/16 Conference assault. The intention was for this money to be used to fund a new, key player for next season.

The Mariners Trust will donate £5,000 to the fund. What's more, Grimsby Town-supporting Euromillions winners Lee and Susan Mullen generously pledged to match the fans’ total with their own donation to a maximum of £20,000.

Within just a few hours of the launch, we'd managed to meet our £20,000 target. By the end of day 1, we'd raised £25,000 - and that didn't include the extra cash promised by the Trust or the Mullen family.

By the end of day 3 we'd hit £34,000. And by the end of the first week we homed in on £40,000. After two and a half weeks we'd nailed £50,000.

Our efforts attracted some fantastic media coverage. We've made the Grimsby Telegraph, Cleethorpes Chronicle, BBC Radio Humberside, BBC Look North, BBC.co.uk and the Non League Paper. We were even featured on Talksport Radio and Colin Murray was so impressed he featured our plight in The Metro.

The current total on the crowdfunder can be seen [here.](http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/gtfc) At the time of posting we're standing at £60k (And that still doesn't include the extra money from the trust + Lee).

I think it's amazing how he remembers where he came from and hasn't let his success go to his head and become too big for his boots- see: clyne and sterling, although they weren't non league they still rose in the game very quickly. 
I was having a discussion with some friends a few days ago and it was about if rickie lambert had stayed at Southampton he'd be one of the best strikers in the league last season, and I'm glad Austin isn't making that same mistake of being number 2 at a top club.  
Also,  I find it incredibly admirable that he doesn't mind sacrificing his international career for us, however I believe that if we stayed up instead of Leicester he would have got the cap instead of vardy. 
The fact that he will stay until told otherwise suggests to me that we can scrap that asking price and reject all bids for him. The only thing I fear is that we lose him next season when his contract is up,  so les better start acting fast. 
I know the term ""legend"" has been used very loosely lately, but the fact that he sticks with us despite clearly deserving more,  shows signs of this,  I'm willing to say now that he is at least an club icon.

superhoops,"This is a post on a [moaning thread on LFW](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/forum/150519/ramsey-satisfied-after-newport-game/#25). I think it deserves to be posted here. The guy in question's credentials are pretty good, ranking up there with most others who cover QPR (has coached QPR ladies, works for SI (Football Manager) and is one of the Loft for Words mob who follow the club all over and can be found in the Crown and Sceptre on matchdays).

&gt;I'm reasonably satisfied by what I've seen so far and there's plenty to be encouraged about. 

&gt;Here's why. 

&gt;It's the small details that matter, not the overall performances or results. Yes there will be some problems that need addressing – but that's normal. 

&gt;You have to first look at the football you see before you consider the performance and results, or the personnel, and then you have to get an idea about the personnel and how they will come together to form a core nucleus of players that make up the starting squad. 

&gt;I've watched a couple of matches on a stream and have been to see us play against Dundee United and Newport County. 

&gt;I'm only interested in the small details, so I'll focus on those, because these are the things that give you the clues on what's going on behind the scenes. 

&gt;Let's take Tjarron Chery as an example. He took a free-kick in the first-half against Newport, a poor one, that struck the wall and then we were suddenly being hit on the counter attack. 

&gt;The free-kick was to the right of the penalty box, but the resulting play materialised quickly down our left side, with Darnell Furlong and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas nowhere to be seen on our right as they were lagging behind having been so far forward for the free-kick. 

&gt;Chery sprinted quietly back into position and filled in for them. He took responsibility for team shape and waited until the danger averted and cover arrived before heading back into position. 

&gt;How often could you say that last season when it came to the likes of Junior Hoilett or Leroy Fer, for example? Even some of our central midfield players wouldn't have done that for the team. 

&gt;That's just one of many small examples I've seen from things we've worked on. 

&gt;Against Newport, the deepest lying central midfielder often dropped back on top of his centre-back when the opposition had the ball, creating a sandwich between them and the opposing striker and freeing up the other central defender to sweep in behind if necessary or pick up someone else who might be lurking. That is something I haven't seen Rangers do for years. 

&gt;I've seen much better build up play from the back and more intelligent passing into corridors of space, that they've clearly worked on. Against Dundee United, I saw Nedum Onouha make far better passes than I've actually really ever seen him play. He wasn't on the ball, nervously waving his hands around ""jazz hands"" style like he can do, he simply knew what runs were going to be made and where to slot his pass. 

&gt;Across the last two matches, I've seen balls sprayed into wide areas, intelligent switches and passages of play designed to encourage the full-backs to attack and overlap and provide additional support to attacks. 

&gt;We've got into great positions out wide and have clearly worked on trying to put balls into the box with players supporting quickly from behind or the other flank to get into the penalty area. Sure, the quality of delivery isn't quite there yet, but the potential most certainly is. 

&gt;But more importantly. Whenever the play has broken down, we've worked hard to get back into shape and pick up in the event of being hit on the counter. The legs and pace of the team have allowed us to be a lot more dynamic in our response to defence and attack. 

&gt;Yes we have weaknesses. And the set up has provided a much clearer separation at this point between roles and who is supposed to do what in defence and attack, therefore, there are occasions where we're asking particular units to deal with particular scenarios. Some of that we've done well with and some of that we haven't, however, we've also not played our strongest side in these games, so you have to balance both the good and bad elements in your mind with what it looks like and will be like when the best team is available. 

&gt;I like that we've looked fast and incisive on the counter attack ourselves, with several occasions where we moved up the pitch quickly after winning the ball. 

&gt;We've also worked on some passages of play that allow the reverse through ball to be played to runners from deep, as we saw with Matt Phillips' goal against Dundee, as well as numerous nearly there opportunities across both games, and again, the pace and legs of the side allow us to play this way now – it's not something we could have done with just Bobby Zamora or Charlie Austin leading the line. 

&gt;We've worked on picking up the ball from deep and playing it around comfortably at the back, but to open our lines of attack and not just willy nilly kicking the ball up field, which is a huge bonus if they can maintain that going forward, especially if they don't dally around there too long. 

&gt;The triangle in midfield was nicely set up and positioned across both games. It wasn't two sitting deep with one in front, it was more of a rotated triangle, with one deep to protect the defence, one further forward to the right and one even further forward to apply pressure on opposing players on the ball. The balance of this triangle makes for good pressing in zones, but also really good options to pass and move the ball quickly. 

&gt;So there are lots of positives. 

&gt;Yes we could have looked a little sharper in front of goal in these games, yes we do need some additional players, particularly in defensive areas, but with what they're trying to do – there's things there that will hopefully fall into place either way. 

&gt;There are always going to be concerns and unknowns, particularly with a new team. I wasn't impressed, for example, with how Emmanuel-Thomas berated the kids all the time when they didn't do something he wanted from them, or to the level he wanted. It lacked a bit of sensitive encouragement, but that might have just been one game, it doesn't make it terrible and the kids do need to learn. 

&gt;The second half the match petered out, but we had a lot of youngsters on the pitch and some of their play was youthful. 

&gt;Across the two matches so far, I'd say Massimo Luongo is crucial to the way we want to maintain possession and attack – we tried him in two different roles across both games – which again is sensible to see how that works and when he went off, Alejandro Faurlin didn't quite have the same style or range of passing so wasn't as effective.",1188,2015-07-27

Diakité - the box-to-box man we've lacked for so long? You get that dude running away at pace with the big man up top and the likes of Chery, Phillips or even Hoilett speeding alongside him as options - magic could happen.

Blackwood - looks like you've got a professional workhorse there, with a sprinkling of talent. If he cranks out those kinds of performances in training, I'd imagine Ramsey will give him time from the bench or even a cup runout.

Chery - the gift that Paladini/Sterling bestowed upon us, there's some beautiful technique and deadball competence as mentioned above.

Gladwin - first time I've seen him, looked good, and he seemed to be pretty in tune with the rest of the squad. Maybe slightly overshadowed by coming in with the Asian Cup player of the tournament but looked just as handy as Luongo.

JET - We looked more dangerous with him on the pitch.

Moving the ball up the field - certainly more entertaining than Zamora-ball.

As much as Ramsey is the focus of the article, I feel like the constraints that we're working under are more important to our current situation than simply the manager and a change of 'culture'. Les Ferdinand in his role as DoF has been key to arranging transfers, which has limited what Ramsey can and cannot do, who he can sign etc. It's a nice change of pace from bringing in Redknapp and Hughes style signings (i.e. throw money at players and hope they get the job done), but you can tell that we're inexperienced in this style of working as Fer, Austin and Phillips are still on our books, the latter two with only a year left on their deals, so we're at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with other clubs. To top it all off, we're also in a poor situation vis a vis GKs. I like Green, he's been a model pro, but he's not a long term option and losing McCarthy was a kick in the teeth. 

I'm also assuming Hoos, new CEO, has some input over the transfers and running of the club, and was brought in to help shore up our finances. I have no idea what he's been doing behind the scenes, but that is an additional contraint that I assume Ramsey has to work under. Maybe he had to do something with us bringing in a GK coach last week. The same here could also be said about our new co-chairman, the money man, and TF's moving back from the hands on running of the club, though maybe he works more long term, again I can't really say.

Finally, we have the hangover of last season and another shitty preseaon. I think the lapses at Charlton are exactly the same kinds of issues that dogged us last season, fatigue, lack of concentration and (again) a shitty preseason. Quite a few local journos and even the author of the piece write about consolidation, but what does that mean? Beyond that, surely, the club should have arranged a better preseason? I think it means that we're about a month behind in terms of preparations, than where we should be, and it shows. Clive mentioned  in the GBBO podcast from last week that he doesn't see us getting many (or any) points from our first three games, and that is in danger of coming true. So how long until our fans turn on him? 

Anyway, this is just a conglomeration of thoughts put together from other sources etc, and I just wanted to put them down somewhere.

Couple of random things from mobile. Think I'd think about starting Doughty over Henry. Seems a touch more versatile. However Henry is still a senior figure so I think he'll be automatic for a few games yet. Maybe better option when holding onto a lead at the end. When Sandro comes back though - if his Internacional training has kept him match fit - methinks he takes that spot. Ephraim was waxing lyrical about Faurlin yesterday. I'd start him against Carlisle and see if he's still safe for a longer stretch. Really like Polter - battering ram. Onuoha scampering off onto the attack and weighting the ball to Phillips was a highlight. Overall pleased with him but I can see a few mistakes in him over the stretch. Gladwin looks more promising than Hoilett but early days. Luongo is a battler - really good to have him as well. Chery gets the ball down to his feat beautifully. On the whole I was pretty entertained, with that final scene with JETS miss and the equaliser playing out particularly humorously in my area.

One thing I noticed was that the lower school end was pretty empty, as were swathes of X block. Maybe the new regime isn't practicing the same seat-stuffing tactics. The attendance was just below 15k. ",217,2015-08-16
superhoops,"I'd also argue that Ramsey pulled the trigger too early and took off Chery and Austin in order to close it out. Our CMs didn't provide enough cover and didn't hold the ball up enough, we gave the initiative totally to Cardiff. ",42,2015-08-16
superhoops,"I think this game is worthy of a post-match thread given its exposure on Sky, as well as it being an interesting game overall.


Lets start with the line-up:

Greeno:

Did well when rushing forward to put pressure on Cardiff, although clearly handling the ball outside his box. However, i have to consider the fact that we are likely to lose possession whenever there is a pass back or a goal kick. Bit ridiculous given his experience. Honestly thinking that we will be alright if we cash him in for the likes of Bentley or Smithies.

Konchesky:

Slow. Did his job and dove into tackles. He did make Noone look faster than Usain Bolt, but nonetheless he had composure and did his job.

Onuoha:

Had a great game in my opinion. He provided the only pace in a really slow backline. His last ditch tackle later in the game prevented us from losing and he utilised his strength when one on one just before the half.

Hill:

MOTM if we were to have won, and frankly he probably is. He was the man responsible for conceding the first goal, but he did score and assist using his fine left arm. I noticed that he was the only player on the pitch that i could hear on TV out of both teams. True leader.

Perch:

Did well in some areas, and got ripped in some instances for pace. It does seem that we have been exploited down our right side from the last two games. He or Phillips may be to blame.

Gladwin:

Great potential and gives 100%. Quite nimble for his stature and is an arial threat that we need.

Luongo:

My Australian bias is in full force. He is great. He runs and runs, whilst providing supply and opening the game up. Both he and Gladwin were great signings.

Henry:

I would rather see Faurlin next week instead. He just lacks a bit of life and vibrancy, although that isn't necessarily needed when you sit just in front of the back four. Faurlin should be able to open the game up from deep without slinging those long balls to Polter/Austin.

Phillips:

Was in glimpses the player that is worth 10m. He really needs to sort out his confidence in taking on the half-backs. Can create the cross that will win us games.

Chery:

How the hell did he keep the ball when it was lobbed to him just before or after half time. He whipped in three or four crosses right into the danger zone. Hopefully with time we will see Polter sitting there to pick them off. Decent game although he is lacking match fitness.

Austin:

Lacked fitness and obviously isn't a lone striker. Did well to get some shots off and could have ended up with a brace.

Polter:

Doesn't have great dribbling at all. He is a work horse though, getting intercepts and setting up other player onto goal. Time will help him, but i am quite optimistic.

Doughty:

Did well. Quite composed given his lack of playing time. Good player to have on the bench at the moment. His time will come when he breaks into the starting 11.

JET:

Seems like another confidence player. Doesn't mind a shot on goal, and he has flair when need be. Another decent substitute to have.

Cardiff have some decent players. Noone, Whittingham, Jones and a couple others are threatening. I think Jones was pivotal in the second half. A really good replacement for Zamora if we were to have kept the same tactics.

Overall, a fair result. We were extremely lucky and somewhat unfortunate. A much needed improvement from last week. We need a CB, a Keeper and frankly, another striker ASAP. ",625,2015-08-16

superhoops,"I think the sad truth (for us internationals especially) is that we will only get streams when games are being shown in the UK and therefore syndicated (proven true for beIN and bet365 so far - they are just relaying UK coverage). So basically, if it is on Sky it will be streamed - if not, no chance. Apparently we used to be able to get streams because the games were being shown in Malaysia (the stream was then replicated most weekends and available). While there is the off chance that during the season the opposition may have games up online, like QPR, most clubs bought into lengthy deals with Perform Group for the substandard 'player' platform many years ago. So we shouldn't expect any changes until that contract expires, which according to the club is next year. Even so, that in itself may not bring about season long live coverage, but I certainly hope so. I live in hope. In a hotter country at least.

As much as we can write off Sullivan's comments, there might be some truth there among what the potential buyers are feeling towards that £15m price tag. That has to be really infuriating for the guy.

Chery actually seems to have a pretty poor command of English (for a Dutch person), having watched his latest interview. Maybe he is still settling in, having arrived pretty late on in the summer? He seemed to enjoy the second one more. I was pleased the the crowd gave him a decent applause when he was subbed off and he seemed to appreciate it. When Fer is back to fitness that should be another positive relationship on the pitch.

Still very early days for a lot of these squad relationships, so hopefully things will improve. Was good to see Faurlin run in to rectify the situation though. We still have a celebration with Mackie on the pitch to look forward to!",218,2015-08-24

superhoops,"I have to disagree. While what you've said sounds lovely in theory, we need to wake up and smell the coffee. We can't afford to dither in the championship and try and engender good team spirit and strengthen the foundation because if we are still in the championship next season all our best players will leave. There is no way we will be able to get through another summer and still hang onto Austin,  Phillips etc. Austin in particular is pivotal to any chances we have of promotion, and we must also put our efforts into getting back up in time to profit from the new EPL TV deal. 

Now, more than ever, we need to get back up. If we don't I think we consign ourselves to another 4 or 5 years in the lower leagues with all the players who will potentially leave in the summer. 

And let's not kid ourselves; if we do get back up it won't come down to whether Onuoha has stepped up or whether our midfielders are working well together, it's going to come down to whether we can keep Austin fit and firing all season long. It cannot be understated how important he will be, and losing him is largely why I think we'd be stuck in the championship for a few seasons. 

Also, credit where it's due: Harry played a big part in this solid core of players we have now. If we get up, it'll be through Harry's players, Luongo and Chery.",252,2015-09-02
superhoops,"From the sounds of things we are not carrying any lunatics, trouble makers or media egos. I suppose one of the biggest cautionary flags to be waved is that QPR is probably still very much a stepping stone club for a lot of these guys. Obviously Austin and Phillips, but also Chery and Luongo. As part of instilling some solidity I'd hope they can set in motion a pattern and plan that can survive the comings and goings of the football world. When one piece drops out, we should have replacements ready and the financial situation to accommodate them.

In common with most home crowds these days, Loftus Road can be pretty quiet, but it just takes a few on-pitch sparks to breathe some life into them. A goal, an injustice, some mayhem. I think (hope) the ingredients are there for a lot of these moments to be served up over the coming months, and I can't really ask for more than that, and my measure of success is walking away from most matches feeling ever so slightly electrified. I'm in no rush to bounce back to the Premier League, but I must admit the prospect of another bout of playoff excitement in May would be fun.",207,2015-09-02

superhoops,"We've had a great start to the season, no question. With a bit of the rub of the green we're flying high in the league, and we've kept our best players in the transfer window. There's a feeling of quiet excitement around the club.

The really exciting part, however, isn't that we boast one of the best squads in the division. Nor should it be the promise of success just around the corner. If we're to learn our lesson from the recent past, success is as much about unity, leadership, teamwork, communication and a clear tactical style as it is about talented individuals. After all, our Premier League squad last year was technically good enough to survive. 

The exciting part is that we now finally have the platform on which to build something that the club has been lacking for the past few years. We've had to drop down a league to do it, but now we can construct something consistent, lasting and strong. It's been a soft landing into the Championship and it looks like we're on our way to balancing the books. We've got a core of players who can together be worth more than the sum of their individual values. The foundations are set.

The questions that will determine whether we're a mid-table side or a promotion chasing side will be ones like, can Ned step up and be the Chief? Will our individually talented midfielders blend into a unit that dominates teams? When we're on a bad run of form and we've got a tricky mid-week mid-winter fixture in some godforsaken corner of Northern England, will we bind closer together or split apart? Since Derry (both the on-field leader and the glue of the midfield) left we've struggled in each of these departments. 

The omens are good. But we should also remind ourselves that the kind of unity and team spirit that we need to rekindle at QPR does not emerge overnight. This is a transition period in which we change the whole ethos of the club, from chasing riches and splashing cash to growing success. We must be prepared for it to take time, and show our patience and continued support even if we don't rocket back up to the big time. No more fixing problems with expensive imports. No more turning on each other. This is our team now. Chris Ramsey is our manager. Solidity first; success second.",404,2015-09-02

superhoops,"The roster is unbelievably crowded now, and I think we'll need to loan some players out.  

Here's a probable starting lineup: (4-2-3-1) Green; Yun, Angella, Onuaha, Perch; Doughty, Faurlin; Chery, Luongo, Phillips; Austin

A strong lineup, definitely.  However the bench gets extremely crowded.  Lets say for arguments sake the bench has 1 striker, 4 midfielders, 1 back, and 1 keeper.

Bench:

ST: Polter, maybe Blackwood fighting for a spot

MF: 4 out of Fer, Gladwin, Mackie, Sandro, Henry, JET, Tozser, Diakite (?) Incredibly crowded.

DF: 1 out of Konchesky, Hall, Furlong, Hill

GK: Smithies

superhoops,"QPR seems to keep benefiting from this strange cycle of fortune and misfortune. Get promoted, suffer from an almost completely frozen transfer window as the club is being sold. Get bought by immensely wealthy owners who'll throw around insane amounts, but get lumbered with mercenaries and maniacs. Get relegated, but bounce straight back up. Get relegated again, but still retain an 18 goal Premier League striker on the books.

I doubt there are many players in his situation who wouldn't have pushed for a move and an inevitable pay rise, even considering an inevitable lucrative signing-on fee elsewhere when his contract is up. Pretty staggering good fortune to have ended up with one.

In light of how the window played out, he should be ravenous for goals. It also must be an instant boost to the morale of all the other members of the squad that he's still here. That bit of star quality will inevitably throw some light onto the rest of the guys. The opportunities to rack up some highlight reel assists should be more plentiful. Every clever ball played up from the back will be that little bit more interesting with the prospect of a poacher of Austin's quality up the top.

I suppose the only possible negative is the question mark over his suitability as a lone striker. However given the apparent focus on moving the ball up the pitch on the ground, and the pace that's available behind him, hopefully he'll be fine. There's also the prospect of occasional Zamora-style partnerships with Polter too.",259,2015-09-03

I pretty much echo this sentiment.

>Our defending, both as a team and the back four, is now at crisis point.

I think this starts at the base of midfield. I'm not sure what the deal is with Henry right now. Why did he take so long to sign the extension? Why is he not putting in the pretty reliable, clockwork performances we saw for a good chunk of the start of last year? Either way from where I stand he is a weak link, and either Doughty or Sandro should be considered to replace him, who presumably have more talent/more desire respectively. Given Fer's return, who on paper should reprise the no. 10 spot, Luongo might be worthy of consideration to help sit at the back, as he seems tenacious and looks to have a touch of the box-to-box about him. In any case I think time should be called on the Faurlin-Henry partnership.

I still suspect, as I've seen others mention, that Hall should have been given a bit more time. It seems we're doomed to lack a Bartonesque captain, so it would at least be nice to have youthful hunger and urgency.

>Phillips...slowly, seemingly, heading back to his pre-Ramsey days. He did try last night, but nothing came off.

One of many catch-22 situations here. Demote him to not being an automatic first XI player (as if we have superior alternatives) in order to try to motivate him? Doesn't strike me as a bad attitude at all, just a confidence thing. It's so frustrating to watch. it will be interesting to see how he plays with an alternative to Austin...Polter appears to be a hold-up ox, which might be useful for Phillips to pivot around?

>Either the chips are down, everyone rallies behind the coach, he takes a long hard look at his methods and tactics and team selections...Or the same poor form continues (Hull apart) and Ramsey will start to hear his name being chanted

>Rob Green, who has been in dreadful form throughout 2015 whatever his happy band of fan club members say or believe

He never looks the cheeriest of fellas, but christ his body language has looked off this season. Maybe he really was banking on that West Ham move after all.

Has this been a long-standing issue with Luongo? For Australia an dSwindon?

>Twice the Argentinean [sic] got involved in dangerous wrestling games with him. Twice referee Kevin Friend could have awarded penalties.

One risk you can understand, twice is a bit reckless. Added to that dreadful pass intercepted by Pringle, and this was a terrible game for Ale.

>Mackie was withdrawn injured at half time after just ten minutes of action

superhoops,"I've seen him once or twice at Loftus Road, either sitting in the stands looking bored or hanging around outside before a match. I'm not sure the regime change at QPR has done him any favours, as the new lot seem to have their own favourite youth players. Petrasso made one senior appearance in a meaningless end of season match here. I would have liked to have seen more. He apparently done well on loan at ~~Northampton Town~~ Notts County and played in a cup game for them against Liverpool, as well as scoring in league appearances for them. I suppose on the plus side left-wing is a position where we lack depth, but our Head Coach is currently sitting under a sword of Damocles and the Twitterati would stage a digital insurrection if he rolled the dice on Petrasso.",140,2015-10-07
superhoops,"He plays for our U-21's. May have a senior appearance or two, but i cant remember. He missed out on Canada's gold cup squad over the summer but from what ive seen he has been doing quite well in olympic qualifying. Who knows, a good showing in qualifying may lead to a spot on the wing with the first team. QPR lacks a capable left winger. ",66,2015-10-07
superhoops,"Just seen Furlongs signed up for an extension on his loan (along with Harriman being gone until the summer). Am I crazy in thinking we've only got one senior right-back at the club at the moment ? I know we've got about 4 or 5 left-backs at the club. Why are we not loaning out a few of them ?

I think Perch is okay but what about an injury (he is 30 now) or if his form dips. I know Furlong is young but I don't rate Perch as that much better than him (and I think Harriman would be fine as a 1st team backup.)

I know you can use a Left-back as a right-back if you have too (or even a Centre-back) but that shouldn't be plan B.

",131,2015-10-09
superhoops,"Bolasie rolled Furlong in a rizla and smoked him like a fiend. He needs an extended run in a first team to develop the more devious side of his game to compliment his pace.

Harriman should come back and start challenging for the first team as soon as he's available in my opinion. He has consistently performed at a lower level and he should be given the chance to see if he can replicate it at QPR.",77,2015-10-09
superhoops,"Perch has been dire from what I've seen (which being based in Glasgow admittedly ain't much).

superhoops,"Ramsey is the Messiah, and one of these Saturdays he's gonna re-open Ocean Billy's and feed the 5000 with a single portion of cod and chips wrapped in Friday's Evening Standard.

We'll see. I'm still happy with him. I still don't buy that the squad is 100% some divisional powerhouse yet. It might become one over the course of the season. Rhodes has scored as many goals as Austin; are Blackburn fans crying that they aren't doing better? Now that Fer and Sandro are back, maybe now people will have more justification for moaning if the squad doesn't perform. They are all attacking players though, and we're already the highest scoring team in the division, what more do people want from the top end of the team? It's still early in the season and the squad is only 3 notches from the top, and overall there's still only 11 points between 3rd and 24th.

Overall I think this team should be good enough to survive and stabilise. Flush out Ramsey now and who knows what will happen? I eagerly await to see the results of the crowd turning on him though. Funnily enough that never happened with Redknapp, in spite of the moaning I heard about him.",207,2015-10-11

superhoops,"In his shoes I'd resign myself to being given the elbow at this point. Thankfully he'll get his money, and in this case I won't begrudge him it. He can't win, the fans will be on his back now and every loss will result in tantrums and meltdowns. It's as if he pulled some Bran Stark shit and took over Onuoha's physical form to concede that penalty today. This addiction to instant results - seemingly not limited to QPR - is insane, and destined to almost always end in tears.

I eagerly await to see what the next man brings to the table. I think people will be in for a rude awakening if they think the squad will perform any better under an alternative, though maybe I'm wrong. It'd be nice see how a team without Henry worked out, I suppose. Neil Warnock's squad won promotion with a very specific recipe, he won't be able to replicate that.

Should've gone for Warburton when we had the chance though, and cashed in on the saleable assets. Tuesday night should be a barrel of laughs.",184,2015-10-17
superhoops,"No longer! I hope this warnock appointment is an indication that he's looking to take over again. The LF comments are encouraging, and would appear to suggest we might not give this manager more time than he deserves, which would be a first. Warnock is far from my first choice, but I would take anybody over Ramsey right now.

I think everybody in this sub knows how I feel about the situation. I'll say it again. If we do not get promotion this season we are fucked. And honestly, I can see TF leaving within the next 2 years if that is the case.",104,2015-10-17
superhoops,"Personally no longer. The fact he kept henry on and took Jet off when we needed a goal shows he's quite inept imo. Also, he won't drop green, onouha or henry despite being out of form and us having better replacements for them all. Not playing ballon d'or shortlisted luongo who has been one of our best this season, to me, shows he doesn't know what his best team is. 
It's a bit of a cliché but he's a coach, not a manager, his decision making is very poor ",89,2015-10-17
superhoops,"The question is more ""who would replace him?"". There's little point kicking him to the curb if there isn't anyone better available.

For me, the biggest problem I've seen (from the few TV performances I've watched) is that the team appear to be mirroring CR's body language & laid back attitude. He doesn't strike me as the most intense, passionate guy and I think that's translating onto the pitch as a lack of energy, grit & determination.

I think that's further compounded by having what appears to be a weak captain in Onuaha.",93,2015-10-17
superhoops,"I think the future is now written, we lose or draw the next game and Ramsey returns to coach with Warnock taking over.. ",23,2015-10-17
superhoops,"Assuming we're not in serious danger of going down I'd give him the season. We need stability, plus Ramsey's a young manager who's still learning his trade. He's made mistakes yes but that's how you learn in this games. I wish so many of our fans weren't such deluded idiots with such high expectations, never used to be this way before the money came into our wee club :/",69,2015-10-17
superhoops,"I think that he still needs time. Especially with news of Warnock coming in to help and the injuries to Austin and Mackie. I would suggest Christmas time. By then either the team will have gelled and people will be back and fit, or we will still be losing and it will be Ramseys fault. 

I'm by no means a huge supporter of Ramsey, but when a couple of players are only just getting back into the team and Austin injured we were always going to have a turbulent time. Given a couple of months the team should stabilise and Warnock will hopefully help Ramsey with selections etc. 

",108,2015-10-17
superhoops,"I may be jumping the gun a bit, we are only 12th in the table, not relegation fodder, yet.

The general opinion, both inside and outside of the club, is the players we managed to keep mean QPR should be trying for a play-off spot.

Warnock has been brought in, in an ""advisory"" role. If I were Ramsey, that would knock my confidence, showing the board's lack of trust in my ability.

The volume of goals we've let in is unforgivable, not worthy of a professional football team.

Is it Ramsey's fault? How many more games should Ramsey be given and, if he goes, who should replace him?",108,2015-10-17
superhoops,"I will give Ramsey one more game to settle this lineup of should-be All Stars before I'd give him the boot.  He obviously has a knack for goal scoring but that means nothing given the state of our defense.

To say that we should be trying for a play-off spot is an understatement.  We should be looking for the top two spots and nothing less given the unbelievable amount of talent in our lineup.

Unfortunately, by not offloading some of our top players, we've saddled ourselves into a situation where immediate promotion is much more important that it should be.  We stay in the Championship another season and we lose half those players, probably for much less than they are worth.

This is our golden opportunity and if we can't bounce right back into the Premiership I'm afraid we face many years outside the top flight.

Our top priority needs to be sealing the defensive leaks, although at this point you have to ask yourself if anything is holding back the tide at all.  If Ramsey can't do it, get someone else in, the sooner the better.",187,2015-10-17
superhoops,"I've read a few interviews with Parish. He says he learnt the hard way how to run the club.

In one interview he explained how players used to bang on his door, demanding a rise,  after receiving a 7 out of 10 performance rating in the newspaper.

He said he no longer speaks to players.  ""That's what I pay the manager to do. ""

He also says most footballers are poorly educated and a bit thick. ",76,2015-10-18
superhoops,"There is a recent Men in Blazers podcast where they interview Steve Parish, Palace owner. The guy would seem to have a better grasp of football business than TF and co.

superhoops,Ramsey feels the heat as QPR lose at Birmingham - report,11,2015-10-19
superhoops,"> Fer is one of a clutch of big-name players Rangers expected to sell during the summer but ended up keeping, raising the expectations which Ramsey is now being judged by. It’s not the head coach’s fault that the Dutch international decided to piss about with the ball deep in his own half, nor that he later spurned a great chance for an equaliser by shooting wide after turning into an inviting position on the edge of the box. You also can’t blame Ramsey for another of the players we’re jolly excited about still having here, Matt Phillips, wasting one two v two counter attack by dallying on the ball, failing to pass to Chery in space or beat the man in front of him, then later selfishly shooting at home keeper Tomasz Kuszczak from an impossible angle with two team mates awaiting a tap in six yards out in the centre. Some will try all the same – in an increasingly nasty and hostile atmosphere among the support base there seems to be a prevailing feeling that everything that goes right is down to the players and everything that goes wrong is because of Ramsey

I'm just starting to feel bad for Ramsey, and I think this sums up my own view on the whole situation. While he has made some mistakes and continues to do so (i.e. Henry & Green for me), I think expectations have changed, and a lot of our players are massively massively underperforming. Couple that with the club now undermining CR and we are going to be in for a horrible rough patch before the inevitable firing happens and we go full circle and end up nowhere. ",283,2015-10-19

superhoops,Lessons in substitutions – Knee jerks - Queens Park Rangers News | Loft For Words,15,2015-10-22
superhoops,"I want to make the following personal statement, for the record...

I'm as frustrated as the next supporter by Ramsey's amateurish substitutions, stubborn refusal to introduce competition for places in the 1st 11, occasional mind-boggling team selections and his inevitable default to fielding players at the end of their careers before youth, which goes against what we were promised. Above all, the current lack of team cohesion and the low self-confidence mean we are under-performing.

But I don't want Ramsey out, yet.

I could go back a season,  two seasons, three and copy and paste our valid criticisms; replace the names with contemporary players and management and my points would be just as relevant.

Changing managers makes no difference at QPR. We've done that and, as one recent article pointed out, QPR don't get the new manager bounce.

Under Ramsey we've seen 1 or 2 good games. QPR now play open and occasionally flowing football. A big change from the get-it-up-to-bobby, root one football we saw under Harry, or the LSD trip under Hughes.

QPR are a work in progress. The deal is that QPR is being rebuilt; manager and all.

We will not be relegated this season.

If we somehow did get promoted, I expect we'd be relegation fodder, again.

After spending more than half a £billion in 4 years, the problems at QPR stem from Fernandes, who has created a club culture that tolerates failure. And what do we have to show for it, new infrastructure? We're £200m in debt, with by far the highest running costs and wage bill in the league, in the mid-table of the Championship, worse off than when he arrived and we can't get rid of him. The club is sick. If Fernandes were a man of his word he'd have left a season or two ago.

The team and the manager will improve. We will finish about 8th in the table. Austin and 1 or 2 others will leave in the summer.

We got our hopes up a bit after Fer, Austin and Philips stayed on. But the club has not changed,  yet.

I'd like us to break the habit of 20 years and pursue a long-term plan, which means dropping our very high expectations and watching some dire football for a while.

As D:Ream said: Things can only get better.",389,2015-10-22
superhoops,"Absolutely agree. When Fer and Austin decided to stay, everyone suddenly expected us to win 40 games.

We don't want promotion.  We really don't. When we're ready to move back up to the Prem in a couple seasons, Ramsey wont be the man for the job, but he's fine for now.  

Also, we're 11 games into a 46 game season, with a relatively new squad. People need to calm down.",70,2015-10-22

Why did Fernandes speak to Ferdinand and not Ruben or the new CEO?

[Surely he has spoken to those two between now and the window] 

Why is Fernandes not in regular contact with the new CEO and why doesn't he know what the club's objective is? 

[He must figure in this management debacle somewhere, so where does he feature exactly] 

Given the above, who is approving all these back room hires if Fernandes isn't happy with the progress of the club? 

[At the last count we have taken on three additional salaries since the window closed] 

Why are we employing these people, like the new CEO, if they have nothing to do with the objectives of the club?

superhoops,"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who was thinking this - there was a point where Henry spotted some space opening up on the right wing, accelarated into it, received the pass but overhit his cross and it went out for a goal kick. 2nd half + right wing = in front of the R block, and they went mental. Booing, chanting and generally abusing him. It's not like he's in the team for his crossing, and his defensive play up until then had been good. His performance noticably tailed off after that, though his work rate didn't. With every error the crowd grew more unforgiving. 

Henry was one of our least bad performers last season, putting in great efforts against a number of the top sides - especially Liverpool in that game we were unlucky to lose. He's one of those players who seem to do best against better opposition, which makes sense considering he's a limited player with the ball at his feet. He certainly deserves far better than the treatment he was given today, and so, for that matter, does Ramsey.",187,2015-10-24

superhoops,"Hi everyone,

TL;DR: Get latest QPR football news headlines at http://footyfeeds.net/news/team/qpr and let me know what you think of it.

I'm a QPR fan/computer science student and I've been working on a football news website. FootyFeeds (http://footyfeeds.net) is a football news aggregator - every half hour it checks for new news articles from a database of RSS feeds for the most popular football news sources around the web.

The aim of the site is provide a place for fans to quickly get all the latest headlines from all their favourite sources, and you have the option of 'Managing sources' allowing you to select the sources you want to see news from. The website should also work pretty well on mobile and I am working on an iOS/Android app.

You can see the latest QPR headlines at http://footyfeeds.net/news/team/qpr - I hope some of you find this useful. If you do or don't I was hoping to get some feedback on what could be improved.

In terms of QPR sources I think I have the majority of the most popular sources (West London Sport, LoftForWords, BBC, etc), however I want to get as many RSS feeds as possible - especially fan run websites. I've created a simple form to allow people to submit feeds to me (http://footyfeeds.net/add) or you can also just message me on here or leave a comment.

I've got a lot of ideas for the future, with the functionality at the moment being quite basic - managing sources and commenting on articles are the few currently implemented features. I'm interested in adding some sort of upvote/downvote system and possibly using social media references to determine which articles are more popular. If you have time to have a look and have any ideas it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time!

That being said, if QPR do remain out of the Prem for a while, I imagine I'll pick up another team to watch on the side, maybe one with a strong American presence.  Of course, it would have to be someone outside of London, because QPR will always come first.

It's just too hard to not have a game to look forward to watching every weekend.  I've seen 4 of the 11 QPR games this year, all on stuttering, low-quality streams.  I've loved every minute of it, but I also miss getting up early every Saturday morning to pop on a beautiful NBC broadcast (and watch Rangers get crushed). 

So, a combination of both. If QPR swim around in the Championship and League 1 for the next 5-10 years, I'll stay connected and attached, but my enthusiasm may wane without matches to see.

superhoops,"In my opinion I would drop the fancy stuff and play a flat 4-4-2. I cannot stand the 4-2-3-1 formation played under Ramsey which just didn't work. It isolated Charlie Austin who we all know plays best in a strike partnership which would fit perfectly with JET. As well as this no wonder our defensive record is so bad when you play Karl Henry and Daniel Tozser in a formation that relies so heavily on the defensive midfielders in front of the back 4. 

Although you may disagree I would personally have this team as my starting XI, bringing in yun at left back who always works his socks off and dropping henry for michael doughty who really impressed when given his chance. Let me know what you all think as well, it would be nice to hear what formations you would all like to see!

GK: Green
RB: Recall Michael Harriman or Darnell Furlong
CB: Hall
CB: Onuoha (Hill when fit)
LB: Yun 
RM: Phillips
CM: Luongo
CM: Doughty
LM: Chery
ST: Austin
ST: JET


",176,2015-11-05
superhoops,"I don't mind the 4-2-3-1 in principle, it's really a case of how it's deployed. Chery is lost on the left because the wingers are clearly under instruction to hug the touchline when we're in possession. Normally that's a tactic where the wingers act as a decoy to spread the defence and create space for runners through the middle. But with Ned and Konchesky as full backs, and a midfield three of Henry, Tozser and Luongo, there's no one running from deep to exploit that space. Better would be if, when in possession, we quickly switch to a 4-3-3 with Philips and Chery and Luongo/Fer flooding the centre. With crisp passing and good movement it should be too much for most Championship defences. That'd be helped by having Yun at left back who can overlap and stretch the opposition defence.",140,2015-11-05

superhoops,"I'm not sure there are enough midfielders with legs to sustain a 4-4-2? I'm thinking Fer, Luongo and Diakité. Maybe Doughty too.

Tozser, Henry, Faurlin aren't mobile enough for me to linger outside the QPR box helping the defense in one phase, only to quickly bomb it forward to help out at the other end for the next. In fact I prefer Tozser and Ale sitting back in the 4-2-3-1 looking to make that killer pass forward.

Once again, I also am yet to be convinced that we're watching a team that can reliably put in crosses from the wing, which for me makes it all the more important that they try and occasionally ladder the ball up the pitch instead through holding midfielders, attacking midfielders and someone waiting up top to pounce.

I'm also too sure JET is a Zamora type battering ram. He seems to be a bit more of a (Championship) finesse player.",156,2015-11-05

A rumour also circulated at the end of last season that Fernandes would sell up towards the end of this year, after he was due to take a more low-key approach to the club.

Looks like Fernandes [has turned the £180m of his company's QPR debt onto shares in QPR](https://mobile.twitter.com/nrogers959/status/663490427685736449?s=09). That could be the preperation required to sell up - Al Faed did this before leaving Fulham.

I'm not a finance expert. It could be that the Tune Group has effectively written off/ reduded the debt by turning the debts into shares in QPR.

Do we have any finance people here?

* Hoilett over Chery on the left?  Or Yun?  Yun had a great comeback against Derby and deserved to stay in the squad.  Chery has proved he is lethal in front of goal on several occasions.  Hoilett does nothing for us unfortunately and shouldn't have made a start.

*  Fer and Sandro.  I just don't feel like they play for the badge.  I mean, they can work but only when they feel like it.  Luongo was in decent form and should've played.  In his 13 appearances he has looked more determined than either Fer or Sandro.

* On the topic of midfielders, Doughty should be playing.  He had a great game against Huddersfield and was then promptly dropped from the starting XI.  Great clubs are made on homegrown talent, players who have been at the club since their youth and bleed hoops.  They have the heart that is required to achieve success.

Crazy Monday.

For what it's worth, the fact that it is an official companies house document and that the figure matches the debt figure so closely gives me some hope. He had mentioned in one of the fan forums a while back that there 'had been discussions about writing off the loans'. If that is what they've done, fair play to them. Is it with a view to sell up though? Hmmmm.

superhoops,"I think if Warnock sticks with the 4-2-3-1 we should field a midfield of Doughty and Faurlin in the pivot with Chery-Luongo/Fer-Phillips in front of them and Charlie/JET/Poulter up top.  At the back I think Yun should be prioritized over a 35 year old loanee and a combo of Hill/Hall and Onuoha in the middle with Perch/Henry at RB.  Tozser/Sandro should only be rotation options in the pivot and Hoilett is hot garbage and Mackie when he gets back can be used as an impact sub.

It would be nice to see Gladwin get some minutes, but I think he really got boned by us retaining Phillips/Fer/Charlie.  So for that I think he'll probably get more action out on loan.  ",120,2015-11-09
superhoops,"We'll see what the longer term ideas any potential new manager brings, I guess? If it's Warnock I assume the 4-2-3-1 will be retained. How rigidly they stick to it, I guess depends on the new guy's priorities. I was shocked at how uniform Preston were on Saturday, for instance. Ramsey (pbuh) on the other hand in one of  his early season interviews alluded to the fact that he preferred a more fluid type of game plan where the numbers meant a little less.

One of the things that really stands out for me on Saturday is that only 2 of the 11 starters were new this season. As mentioned elsewhere, 5 of the supposed superstars were on the pitch at kick-off. They failed, at home against a newly promoted team. No wonder they were relegated. Watching it, I couldn't help but think that this was a team essentially welded together with money, not team spirit.

I imagine Perch will be straight back in. At the end of the day I think playing in a position like full back involves a lot of instinct developed through extensive training and match time with the touchline to one side. A getaway driver speeding away from 100 bankraids in London would probably not be as effective on the 101st if it was in Paris, with the flipped steering wheel and road orientation.

I think Chery on the left and Luongo through the middle is a legit option, and I was a bit dismayed to see this dropped on Saturday. I really would have liked to have watched a Gladwin - Luongo - Chery trio playing behind JET, and had they offloaded the Holy Trinity I think we might have been treated to it. I guess Chery would be more suited to a central role, but despite his tendency to disappear from matches I think he's shown occasional glances of brilliance, such as the Bolton strike.

I'm with you on Hoilett. Can't ever imagine him as more than an impact sub. He looked OK on Saturday, but nothing new there, he always flatters to deceive. Still a few months to prove me wrong I guess. If he does need some hand-holding, Warnock might be the man to do it.

Sandro is Redknapp's last laugh. I still think Tozser might come good in rotation with Faurlin. Short of dropping Luongo back, I'm not sure who you partner them with though. I think Fer is a little one dimensional, but maybe he's still working his way back to fitness.

I wouldn't be surprised if Doughty, Yun and Polter try to jump ship in January, and I wouldn't blame them. It's a shame, because I think throwing together supposedly inferior players to capped internationals and players pocketing a million or two a year is more likely to forge a better team. David Bardsley wrote a piece detailing how that was the character of his QPR side back in the day.

In any case, I think focus going into the break is now shifting to events off the pitch. Who knows what will have happened between now and Middlesbrough?",521,2015-11-09

But then we kept Austin, Phillips, Fer and Sandro, and suddenly its a disaster if we don't go up. Now hopefully we'll sell in the window and people will come back to their senses and realize that in the long run, going up might be worse than going down again",71,2015-12-04
superhoops,"With JFH in, there's a new-found excitement amongst the Rangers fans, or so I feel at least, but also some nerves. At 43 and with no more experience than a champion season in League Two and half a season in League One, albeit a first place on the table after 20 games, he's not exactly massively experienced. Still has a lot to learn in terms of management.

But, to my point; do we really want promotion this season? I for one would rather take another season in the Championship, rather than yet another Premier League relegation after yet another abysmal season packed full of bad signings and ""unlucky"" losses. I think goal nr. 1 for now is to reach stability.

Junior Hoilett, Armand Traoré, Samba Diakité, Rob Green (getting old, big wage, and has been shaky these last couple of months) and Karl Henry all have contracts expiring at the end of the season. Getting those offloaded would be a massive weight off all of our shoulders. Would also like to see Leroy Fer find his way out. Going from the World Cup and Premier League to the Championship, he just can't find any motivation. Not at all worth his wage, would rather see young talents such as Luongo and Gladwin get those chances, young hungry players fighting their nuts off.

Now I know what you're saying; not achieving promotion will certainly see the end of Austin and Phillips' QPR careers. Yes, it probably will, but I'm still adament stability should be our nr. 1 target now NO MATTER WHAT. Fernandes keeps saying he's learnt, but has he really? Had we been in the Premier League in the 13/14 season with the same wage, we would've been 8th on the ""wage-table"". Though this season and last seasons numbers haven't been released, I'm not expecting them to be massively reduced. A bit, probably.

Smithies have been dead awful in the few chances he's got, he conceded 6 goals for the U21's. Greeno nearing the end of his career, probably has a couple of years left though, just look at Jussi Jääskeläinen (or whatever) and Shay Given. Would love to see Dan Bentley enter the doors at Loftus Road, massive talent and reportedly a bit upset he wasn't allowed by Southend United to join QPR in the summer.

Other than that, it looks like we've got ourselves a robust midfield pair in Faurlin and Sandro. Gotta love Faurlin, and Sandro is a proper warrior. Grant Hall started the season shaky, but man, he's really grown into his role. Looks solid and consistent. Though I like Onuoha, you just can't rely 100% at all times I feel. James Perch is rubbish, makes too many mistakes, and never really makes up for any of it with like a brilliant assist/goal or a 90th minute goalline clearance when we're 1-0 up away from home. 

Can't wait to get Mackie back. My favourite QPR player, but not far ahead of Faurlin and Hill. Hall and Luongo growing on me.

If you disagree or I've left something out, please call me out on it.

EDIT: Yeah one thing; would like to see Tom Bradshaw of Walsall replace Austin when he leaves. 22 years of age, scored 17 goals in League One last season, and has got 9 goals so far. Man's got pace and stamina, real talent, and has been called up to the Wales senior squad already, but has yet to feature in a game though.",580,2015-12-04

I would love another season to build in the Championship with these players, make very minimal changes to the line up and build the youth.  As I have said before, the biggest question mark is Austin.  We need to make a decision on him now.  It is awful asset management if he walks for nothing.  If he is going to leave at the end of the season then it is vital you get something for him now.  ",139,2015-12-04

JFH has only had 1 week in charge, he's still trying to implement his style of football and probably doesn't even know his best 11 yet. To come up against a team like Burnley who are one of the hot favourites for promotion this year and outplay them in the first half as well as consistently staying tight at the back, I think thats a pretty solid first result. Grant and Ned had Andre Gray in their back pocket, someone thats scored 11 goals this season and the only thing we were lacking was some quality in the final third. All I ask is that instead of moaning after his first game in charge, lets give the guy a chance and try and bring some stability to the football club, something that we've been lacking for a very long time. ",162,2015-12-12
superhoops,"> Rangers were fortunate to find Burnley flat footed in the fifty-third minute when Onuoha, correctly, allowed a ball to bounce in behind him expecting his goalkeeper to come and claim only to find Green, not for the first time this season, glued to his line, motionless, apparently thinking about other things. Thankfully he'd returned to us two minutes later and was sharply out to save at Gray's feet on the edge of the box. Still, another concerning performance, peppered with wild kicking for which the strong wind would have been an excuse had Tom Heaton at the other end not been so completely untroubled by the conditions. 

I am really worried that Green keeps his place in goal, regardless of which manager we have. Maybe it's his locker room presence - he seems a model professional, however, his kicking is so poor and he seems to make a hash of something at least once a game. 

Also this was a big take away from the Burnley game, and it will be interesting to see how JFH mixes it up to keep things fresh, I really want to see Luongo in for Fer and for Charlie to be starting too.

To me, the biggest mistake this season was not selling Austin.  Just poor asset management.  Buy low and sell high and the club screwed that up.

superhoops,"I kind of perceive this as a three pronged issue.

Firstly, the most obvious issue, is the performances themselves. Season after season now we're seeing similar issues - over-reliance on one man getting goals, poor patterns of play with little clever instances of moving the ball forward, a stubborn refusal to cross the ball and an infuriating knack for conceding late goals. On top of all this, the club  constantly seems to fall back into this position of playing their most seasoned, highly paid players even when they don't seem to form an effective, cohesive unit. Yesterday underlined all of these points.. Regardless of the point gained, it was so, so poor...honestly one of the worst performances I can remember. I'm not sure on what dimensional plain it is logical to rotate Karl Henry between right winger and number 10, but it seems I'm living there. I can only really remember two spells where it seemed they were bucking this trend - for a stretch in the first half of last season Vargas and Isla were clicking well, and we moved the ball nicely down the right wing, and in the early part of this season, when Luongo and Chery were involved and we were unlocking opposition defenses and scoring goals, while admittedly shipping them as well. It seems Vargas and Isla were horribly handled though, in common with a long list of other players over the past few years. Mackie, Faurlin, Simpson, McCarthy, Mutch, Vargas, Isla, Yun, Diakité, Doughty, and number of young players...I'm sure you can all add a few names. You can't mess players around to this degree and expect to positively develop the product on the pitch. I'm getting sick of it, and it's becoming tough to get behind the 11 guys on the pitch when season after season the characters who kick off in August aren't those starting a few months later.

The management of the club is another issue. Would Fernandes and his pals have bought QPR if it wasn't a Premier League club? Has he ever had a solid plan for what to do with QPR as a non-PL club? The Tune Group tenure has seen a lot of unexpected twists and turns - if they had had to deal with relegation in 11/12 maybe they would have learned some valuable lessons sooner. If the Redknapp Championship squad didn't fluke promotion, they might have started a solid rebuild earlier (Ephraim mentioned Redknapp was a cert for the exit prior to Wembley). They have had an uncontrollable, unpredictable animal in QPR which they have left others to handle from a distance, and christ knows under Beard and Redknapp and whatever forces were at work in the dressing room things went from bad to worse. I had hoped that Ferdinand and Hoos coming in and making the right noises would have us in a happier place now, but I'm sceptical based on what I see week in week out. There seems to be a lack of backbone, courage and discipline. I don't see a lot of conviction and willingness to stand their ground in the face of dressing room egos and rabid fans. I think they also showed a lot of weakness in dealing with the assets that the club had over the summer. Sometimes you need to drop the asking price as a seller. Sometimes you need to be more proactive to force through the sale. I suspected that Austin and Phillips should have been cashed in. I think my hunch was right. As well as reaping a financial benefit (which we now won't see), the squad selection would be simpler. Throughout the Fernandes era, I suspect the only player we've possibly seen a profit on is Remy. After four years, I've still yet to see evidence that they know how to handle the football market.

Lastly...the supporters themselves. You can't condemn them entirely for baring their fangs after a few years of absolute abuse from many elements of the club, but it seems they've reached this level of baseline discontent where some really poisonous voices are able to make themselves heard much more easily. There's always a witch hunt on. Fer seems to be the latest victim, and he was booed off the pitch yesterday. He's been most anonymous and shit, but to be derided as he ran off? He's not here because he bleeds blue and white, we all know that, but he hasn't pissed on the badge. Karl Henry. Traoré. Mbia. There seems to always need to be one of the starting 11 that people can line up in the crosshairs. Apparently Ferdinand was berated by an older suppporter at Loftus Road yesterday about Leroy Fer, to which Les replied it was a confidence thing. If that is the case, how is throowing him a sea of wanker signs as he hits the bench going to help? And then of course there was the whole furore around Ramsey, which has been well covered. It must be a shit atmosphere to play in, and it's certainly often a shit atmosphere to attend as a supporter. In a lot of ways QPR reminds me of the pub I used to get dragged to by a babysitters family back in the day, just off Hanger Lane, that no longer exists. A collection of familiar faces getting together for a drink and a good time. It's a double edged sword, because for all the charm, character and continuity that brings, it becomes very hard to evolve it in to something more contemporary without maintaining all of that and pissing off the traditional core. Maybe it's just the curse of modern football hitting home. Head over to Twitter and behold the timeline of Steve Gallen's axing - seemingly confirmed by Kevin Gallen - to witness how this plays out in the real world.",977,2015-12-28

Angella was rightfully dropped from the side to accommodate Hill, who was playing exceptionally well earlier in the season.  Sandro reappeared in the starting XI and has been playing well as of late. Unfortunately Faurlin did not play, perhaps the compact schedule is affecting him.  Tozser was not the correct replacement.  Henry is not going to win us any games.  Fer underperformed once again.  JFH has to understand this and truly seek out his best XI.  Luongo, Chery, even Doughty have shown glimpses of what they can bring to the club and are not getting the chances they deserve.  Even Yun sits idly by on the bench.

Other players just don't look good enough and are probably not going to get their deals at QPR matched at other clubs.

If Fer goes maybe they'll make a modest signing, one of JFHs old boys perhaps. I don't think there's any real money available otherwise.

Leroy Fer's time is up for me, he's had a run in the side these past few weeks and for me he just hasn't cut it. I'd like to see young hungry Massimo Luongo take his place in the starting line up.

Steven Caulker. I've heard the rumours of palace interested in buying him permanently due to him being surplus to requirements at southampton after the van dijk deal. Rumours state that he would be involved in a swap deal with Dwight Gayle + they give some £££. I really do hope these rumours are true, gayle would produce a solid replacement/partner for Austin who possesses great pace, something we lack this year. 

Sandro. For me on a good day this guy is the best defensive midfielder in the league. Him and Faurlin together are easily our best midfield partnership (doesnt help that they are the 2 most injury prone players at the club). I've heard rumours of clubs coming in for him this window and I'd really like him to stay. If worst comes to worst and he does leave I'd like to see Michael Doughty back in the side.

Hoilett. This is a strange one for me. For someone thats sat on his ass enjoying his 50k a week for the past season or 2 this guy has impressed in recent weeks and looked like our biggest threat. Do we keep him based on his recent form or do we get rid of him as hes a liability? I think he's got to be kept as he is the only one that actually takes a man on in our side. 

Matt Phillips. Although he had a great run of form towards the end of last season and the beginning of this season, I think hes the most overrated player in our football club. His talent is undeniable but hes so lazy and unfit its unreal. He barely ever takes his man on and never jumps for the ball with any desire. 

I think the squad as a whole is highly overrated. Without Austin this squad is nothing but a championship side, our midfield depth isnt of the quality it needs to be, we NEED full backs and I cant express how badly we need a decent winger (adomah cries out to me). Anyway thats my thoughts, Id like to hear yours so please leave any comments below!!!

superhoops,"Agree on a lot of your points. I would love to see Luongo, Doughty, even Gladwin back in the mix. We have hungry young players, why not play them instead of the older players who we know can't cut it in the Prem?",43,2015-12-30
superhoops,"I wanted to give my opinion on who I think should leave the club in January and some players we should look to bring in. 

Out:

- Austin - Done a great job for the club but getting £10+million would be great to be reinvested into the club. Even with Austin staying I don't see a strong enough side to push for promotion.

- Fer - Fer has been an on/off player since his arrival. Some days he is a game winner, other days he seems invisible on the pitch. Get some cash for him and allow Luongo and Doughty some time on the pitch. 

- Traore - What has even happened to him?

- Karl Henry - Maybe keep as a squad player, but I just don't see this love affair managers seem to have with him?

- Caulker - Reported interest from Palace, recall and sell him. Doesn't seem to have a future at the club.


In:

- Dwight Gayle - Palace looking to offload, with joint interest in Caulker perhaps a straight swap is something both clubs would be interested in. Would be a good pacey replacement for Austin.

- Damien McCrory - Hasselbaink knows him from Burton. Hopefully would get Konchesky out of the team as Yun seems to be forgotten about.

- Bradley Dack - Young, scoring goals and would be a great fit for our midfield. 

These are a few transfers I'd like to see in January. Who would you like to see come and go?",252,2015-12-30
superhoops,"He has been nothing short of rubbish for most of his stay at QPR. He was ""the next big thing"" when he joined from Blackburn, but has never properly delivered. He's had his moments, I remember the start of the 13/14 season, he was brilliant in the season opener, assisted Onuohas goal and so unlucky not to score, but got his goal in the next game vs. Huddersfield. And then he got injured. That's pretty much just repeated itself. He's very predictable, opponents who have done their homework (which on this level is most players) can read him like a wide open book.

Tbf he has done quite well as of recently, but I still see no future for him at QPR when his contract expires at the end of the season. Tbh, I would want him to find his way out this transfer window, his wage is just too big",151,2016-01-01
superhoops,"Junior Hoilett has been Junior Hoilett. He can run quite fast, often into a deadend, can't reliably cross the ball, and will work pretty hard to retrieve balls that he loses, often physically to the point he draws a foul. I'm pleased he finally committed himself to Canada, as it will benefit his overall game and give him a few more career goals. Not a bad player but not a world beater. Should do well for Canada against the likes of Nicaragua and El Salvador and hopefully can help them get that third CONCACAF spot. I wish him well in his future endevours, as I don't believe they will be here at QPR.

superhoops,"Already after a mere six games in charge, QPR ""supporters"" are already calling for the sacking of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. My response to that, is ""you can not be serious...""

Fair enough, he has not won any of the six games and some seriously poor football have been displayed, but what were you expecting? Six straight 4-0 wins?

Forget promotion. Forget the fucking play-offs even. This is the time needed for JFH to figure out what needs to be done, who needs to find the exit door and who needs to be signed. Everybody spoke about taking a couple seasons in the lower leagues, only to return stronger. But then, we kept Austin, Phillips, Sandro and Fer, and all of a sudden, not getting promoted would be a disaster. Ridiculous. Sell Austin in January, get a striker in (Dwight Gayle?), maybe two, and for the love of God, find a replacement for Robert Green. He's been costing us too many points through personal errors. Dan Bentley was reportedly upset when Southend United wouldn't let him join QPR in the summer, get in a bid for him ASAP.

And what the actual fuck does Massimo Luongo have to do to get a game? Karl Henry contributions are next to nothing, yet he's in the starting XI week in, week out. In the few nr of games Luongo has played, he has impressed me at least. He runs for hours on end, he fights and scraps like few others, and he is still young and very hungry for success. 

Would like to see Leroy Fer sold in the January transfer window as well. Spoke with a football commentator who is also a Norwich City supporter, and he told me when things aren't going Leroy's way, he has no motivation, and it shows. When he goes to ground, he doesn't jump up, he pulls himself up slowly, doesn't look interested. Can't blame him though. Going from playing and scoring in the Premier League and World Cup, to be playing Rotherham away. He's just not at all worth his wage, has scored one goal this season and that was a bloody tap-in.

A note on Polter; Apart from the 1 minute he set up Phillips and converted the following cross, he was rubbish last night - again. He has the techical ability of a donkey, and his passing accuracy can't be higher than 38%. Ramsey was banging on about his physique when he signed him, but tbh, he's not looking particularly physically superior to anyone. I've been way more impressed with JET, would also like to see Mackie up top again, let's not forget he scored 8 goals in his first 7 games for us when he signed in 2010. Polter may work his socks off, but frankly, that's not enough.

**Players I would like to see signed:**

**Josh Meekings (23):** Young, English centre back who's been Mr. Reliable for Iverness in the Scottish top flight. Last season he even booked himself a place in the ""Team of the Year"", and for a centre back he's got really good pace, and also, physique. He has much of the same problem as Polter; his physique and defending is very much up to scratch, but his technical abilities is nowhere to be seen. But let's be honest, who needs it more - a striker or a centre half?


**Tom Bradshaw (23):** Already a Wales international, Tom scored 17 goals from 29 league appearances last season, and so far this season he has got 9 from 20 appearances. Not nr 1 material for a Championship side pushing for promotion, but good back-up and one for the future.


**Daniel Bentley (22):** Despite his young age, Dan has already got over 100 professional appearances to his name. With an aging Robert Green and an unconvincing Alex Smithies, Dan might just be what we need.",645,2016-01-02
superhoops,"I agree that anyone calling for JFH's head after less than 10 matches is a lunatic, but unfortunately they exist in abundance among QPR support and I fear we'll end up with the doomed club the more rabid sections of P, Q and R blocks are calling for.

I also agree on Luongo. t's really depressing that he can't get in the squad.

I think calling Polter rubbish and Smithies unconvincing based on 336 and 107 match minutes respectively, especially when the former has racked up two goals and an assist over the last two weeks, is harsh. In Polter's case, [this sums up best how I feel about it](http://loftforwords.fansnetwork.co.uk/forum/161714/page:2/#47):

>Polter is an interesting example of how the dynamic of the crowd and the support has changed at Loftus Road. Previously we absolutely reveled in having those unconventional, underdog players in our team. Maybe not technically the best, maybe a bit odd to watch, maybe a bit of a maverick, but 110% effort, totally committed and effective. We used to absolutely love somebody like that and make cult heroes of them. Jamie Mackie, Devon White, Danny Shittu, Stuart Wardley maybe, Rufus Brevett maybe. 

>Now we absolutely pummel Polter, even when he's doing a good job for the team and both scoring and setting up goals regularly, presumably because we think we as a club should be above that, and should be out there spending more money on accomplished strikers and big names - like that's worked at all for us over the past five years. I know some on here get their hackles up at the word ""spoilt"" when it's been used about the supporters this season, but we've certainly changed as a group of fans.

He won a few headers, got physically stuck in regardless of the outcome, and won a few fouls. Playing at the top of the pitch, his mistakes aren't going to be punished as harshly as, say, Fer's, Onuoha's or Green's were. If you really want to start crucifying people for no end product in the final third, redirect your anger towards Hoilett, Fer and Phillips, all of whom almost certainly do it at far greater cost to the club.

As for the signings, Gayle aint coming to a lower half Championship team. Your defender would have to play third fiddle behind Onuoha and Hall. Signing Bentley would be farcical given that the only things that have changed since we last tried to sign him are we signed someone else and we no longer have any hope of promotion.

Bradshaw looks promising, but he's being linked to a lot of other clubs already. He would definitely address a need. Other than the rightback spot - where they seem to be going in on the cheap with Motta - an extra striker is the only position I think they should address, given Austin is gone by June.",481,2016-01-02

superhoops,"First half was bang average, second half was poor. Second best all over the pitch today. Couldn't string three passes together. How on earth Boro thinks Phillips is wort £6m I will never know. What baffles me even more is how Fernandes appears to think he is worth even more. 

And Chery, you gotta score there, not matter how little match fitness you've got or how out of form you are. We were lucky to get a point, three would be a miracle, and today, you cost us a miracle, Tjaronn. Brilliant first touch by Washington, great work and great cross. Can't wait for him to get a start now.

We may have been very unfortunate to concede the way we did, but the defence is just inviting the shot. They're just watching him, allowing him all the time and space, and Henry doesn't let that fo unpunished. Someone needs to take charge. Onuoha needs to step up. You can't really rely on Onuoha - one minute he'll make a goalsaving tackle, the next, he'll cost us a goal. 

Van La Parra looked like Ronaldo out there. Hasselbaink needed to get Hoilett on him when he was charging down that left hand side with his superior pace, but each time it was either Henry or Konchesky who took chase. On another day that would have easily cost us a goal. Nearly did, had it not been for the Chief.

Phillips and Fer should be shifted, but the club will take a huge hit on them. And Jack Robinson cannot get back to fitness any sooner. There was a total lack of desire in the team in the second half, like always, we struggled against a hard working side. Classic Rangers. I do not envy JFH's job in the slightest, he will be fighting an uphill battle for a long time yet. ",105,2016-01-23
superhoops,"Just back. The more I replay the game in my head the angrier I get, and I wasn't anticipating getting worked up over the result today no matter how it went.

For me it was the shocking central midfield that got me wound up. It was like there was a black hole in the middle of the QPR shape. Fer was really poor today, honestly time and time again he mistimed his jumps and just never looked dangerous on the ball. Luongo - dear oh dear oh dear - I've been anxious for him to come back into the squad but apart from one move in the first half he just looked out of it, and to me it looked like his confidence was undone towards the closing period of the match. I think these two performances made Henry look worse, who was after all just Karl Henry.

Phillips just doesn't look hungry enough for this level to me, and any scouts watching him would surely have been more impressed by van La Parra, who in turn was probably flattered by our achilles heel left flank. Konchesky. For fuck's sake. The other thing that got boring very quickly was the goal kick up to Hoilett.

Harry Arseknapp's ghost lives on in Sandro's contributions. This was the kind of game where we could have really used his skill set, but naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah the multi-million pound man has other things to entertain himself with.

I make that 4 points that Chery has cost us with fluffed shots this year. I won't judge him as harshly though as he can't get consistent game time.

On the plus side - Smithies, Hall, Polter and maybe even Washington. Looks like some good business here under the new regime. The latter must have wanted to strangle Chery. Lovely first touch,  although it's far to early to be proclaiming a new pope. I'd be so tempted to switch to 4-4-2, but I'm not sure they've got the right set of players to put in the middle.",338,2016-01-23
superhoops,"I think thats quite harsh. Chery had to backtrack and shoot around his body. He was unfortunate not to knock the ball 4cm to the right.

They had very little chances. Le Fondre did nothing all game and their only real threat was La Parre, of which is faster and more agile than Konch. Yun would have been perfect.

superhoops,"Mackie, Samba ... Don't really see the need to offload many players to be honest. Wish Traore and Yun could get more game time.",24,2016-01-24
superhoops,"For me what was really surprising in yesterdays game was that the ex premier league players that supposedly are our 'best', were our worst performers. 

Matt Phillips - Maybe it was because we didn't want to sell him to someone else in the championship but please if someone bids anymore than 5 million again take the money and run away before they find out hes not worth it.  The one thing I will give to him is that he can cross a ball, and its the only reason he's still in the side. When you look at someone like Van La Parra in yesterdays game it really puts into perspective how lazy Matt Phillips is. He had a good run of form in the 2nd half of last season and somehow managed to see his valuation double. If I was JFH I'd sell Matty and be straight on the phone to Van La Parra's agent. Thats 2 times I've seen him this season (when he was on loan at brighton) and both times he's outshined matty phillips - the winger supposedly worth 10 million. 

Leroy Fer - Worst player on the pitch yesterday. Apart from scoring a few tap ins, he has been awful all season. When you play him in a 4-2-3-1 where the midfield plays such an important part you cant be expecting to take anything from the game. Lazy, Slow, sell him ASAP.

Karl Henry - Dont think I need to write anything. How this man gets in the team over Faurlin, Luongo, Sandro and Doughty when he was here really does confuse me. Once again another goal conceded that started from his error.

Full Backs - We need new full backs. Konchesky got embarrased yesterday. Hes 34, Slow, cant cross a ball and is going in the different direction of our club. I would like to see Yun play but god knows where he is so it would be nice to see us buy a young energetic left back. Perch does a job at right back but I still think we need someone else there. If Perch gets injured and forces chief to play RB, we are asking to concede goals.  

Some positives - Thought Polter was outstanding in the first half yesterday. He may not have the technical ability but he does not stop working and thats exactly the type of player you want in the championship. From the small time that Washington was on the pitch he did look promising, I'm looking forward to the future with this kid. Chery's miss really was a shame but I cannot help but feel sorry for him. Had a great first couple of starts and has suddenly been dropped for his dutch colleague leroy who again contributed nothing. I think he should be given a consistent run in the side before he is judged. Massimo Luongo should be playing every game. He wins balls that he has no right to win and really doesnt stop working, I can really see him having a bright future as long as he is not dropped. Finally Alex Smithies... Given the number 1 shirt and he stepped up big time. A trio of outstanding saves and a generally good performance was very pleasing. Oh.. and it was nice to see a goalkeeper kick past the half way line for once. 

With a bit more luck I do see a bright future under Jimmy. The majority seem to have accepted now that its a rebuilding process and the performances are getting better. Some may disagree but for me we cash in on Phillips and Fer, bring in some more young talent and then think about competing next year. COYR'S.",617,2016-01-24
superhoops,"I agree with most of that. At this point I'd be thinking about the financial side of things - maximise on fees wherever possible and shift high earners. The books simply have to be balanced. Unfortunately we aren't living in an ideal world and the only fee I can imagine is for Phillips, and I'd be happy if they got the same price they paid for him at this stage. Beyond him you're looking at the high earners, and I make assumptions on their salary based on when they signed. Sandro, Fer, Green, Traoré, Hoilett and Diakité. I think the latter four will see their contracts run down this year, so I'm doubtful about moving them out.

Edit: And I'll break ranks on the Austin love-in. They should have made more effort to move him in the summer. Charlie Austin primarily looked out for himself. From interviews and journos it seems that he was the one who didn't accept the offers on the table. He was the one who didn't sign a new contract in the middle of last season. QPR lost out on millions that mean a lot more in the Championship. Finally...I think his appearance yesterday puts his last few absences for QPR in a slightly darker light. There's the big transfer failure for 15/16, and it was partially out of the club's hands. In the pantheon of QPR heroes, there are currently three still on the books who are more prominent than Charlie Austin.",247,2016-01-24
superhoops,"I agree with your selection.

While Konchesky tries 100%, he's now too easily beaten with pace down that wing; so he's likely going to make a reasonable centreback, somewhere.

Philips keeps underperforming, or perhaps,  that's it; that's really as good as he gets.

I've not been on the anti-Henry bandwagon. Yesterday's game changed my mind. At times, he looks clueless, when he wasn't even under pressure. No excuses for that. He's just not good enough.


Most of all: I don't want to see anymore hoofing of the ball up the pitch. I'm fed up with it. It's Sunday league football; not something I want to pay to watch.

In yesterday's 2nd half, for the first time ever, I considered walking out of the stadium during the game. Getting to the point where I can't take watching anymore of this.


Now they want us to renew our season tickets in March, or we'll be penalised. I may not renew.

The young players we've picked up over the last year have the potential to be great in the future (Grant Hall, Conor Washington, Luongo, Ingram, Robinson (I know we picked him up earlier),  Smithies & Polter). These are all players that other clubs were keeping an eye on but didn't want to push the button (or take a risk on them). 

If we can get rid of the parasites like Caulker, Fer & Sandro; I think next year will be looking good even if we don't go up I believe the team and club will be much strong for it in the coming years.

superhoops,"Hi everyone!

     I'm a student at a college in the states and I'm currently taking a class on the political economy of world football.  I was assigned to study QPR as my team for the semester and I was wondering if you QPR fans could help me answer some questions about the club and its history (I'm a lifelong Arsenal fan, but I don't really know too much about QPR).  I'm currently enjoying reading about the artificial turf at Loftus Road in the 80s and the teams success under Terry Venables. However, I still need some sort of ""insider"" information, if you will, about the club.

   Firstly, I was wondering that for those of you who have been lifelong fans and live in the West London area, what is the area like in terms of demographics (race, gender, ethnicity) and how has it changed in the past couple of years? 

 I was also wondering about QPR fan culture as a whole... What would you guys describe yourselves if you had to generalize yourselves (and has it changed over the years)?  I.e, Newcastle fans are working class coal miners, Aston Villa fans extremely white vs. Birmingham fans etc.

Any help you guys could give me is much appreciated and I hope y'all make it to the Premiership soon! the more London teams the better! Cheers!",224,2016-02-20
superhoops,">what is the area like in terms of demographics (race, gender, ethnicity) and how has it changed in the past couple of years?

Here are some stats from three of the local government entities - [Hammersmith & Fulham](http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Images/14_62ds_71424_councillors-induction_10-borough_profile_rev5_tcm21-188745.pdf), [Ealing](http://ealing.cmis.uk.com/Ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=cEIfTAXlsDc5CN%2Fg5kXx1fVb6GGHzc%2BHywVMRbg9J%2BdrwxW1wjX5JA%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) and [Brent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Brent#Demographics). You're looking at about 50% white people (which doesn't always mean White British). To my eyes QPR's support simply hasn't kept up with this trend, and if you want to get a taste of what the area used to be like, maybe watch the film [Quadrophenia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079766/locations), which is set in the area in the '60s. Like most clubs outside the top 4 or 5, QPR has a problem with aging support, and this film is more reflective of the world a lot of the people who sit around me come from.

Some family friends used to look after me a lot as a kid and I remember they always used to frequent a golf club and the Conservative Club (as in the political party). While they might have been genuinely interested in these things, they essentially used them as places to hang out and drink. QPR strikes me as being a bit like this - people don't necessarily turn up as a matter of civic pride in their local community any more. I don't think many supporters live immediately local these days - Shepherd's Bush was a bit of a shithole and as suburbs sprung up, people generally got out. These days it's a typical inner-London mix - a lot of rented accommodation, some government housing (including a huge swathe of social housing right next to QPR) and absolutely obscene gentrification. There isn't really a large pool of your average joe-types to entice into coming down to QPR. As the older generation of fans dies off, I can't see where they'll be replaced to be honest, and I'm not sure their kids will be bothered about spending time and money travelling in - often from pretty far out - to watch.

> What would you guys describe yourselves if you had to generalize yourselves

I doubt you'll get a lot of variation to this question outside the biggest clubs with global support. White working class roots, with a fair few who have jumped into the middle class with time.",380,2016-02-20

superhoops,"I think I'd classify QPR fans as very multi-cultural like London. I have seen all the demographics at the games except maybe Asian people (japanese/korean(maybe when Ji-sung Park was playing)/Chinese) but that's because I don't think many Asian people are living in the area.

Mostly working class or middle class nowadays, the fans tend to be dedicated and not glory hunters (because there ain't much glory to hunt here atm). I would say that they are more dedicated than the average fan because there are a lot of London clubs in all divisions of the FL (and PL) so it's not like you are a QPR fan just cause you were born in London (unlike say Hull fans and Hull).

I grew up in North-London but became a QPR fan when I started going to the games when I was younger. Early 30s now was a season-ticket holder for a few years but have moved away and takes about 2-3 hours to get down now so I only go when I am visiting family now.",175,2016-02-20

You'd hope something like that line of thinking was at play, because otherwise you'd start to worry that JFH has some tactical lessons to learn. Interestingly enough Brentford plucked their manager from another high flying League One team and a lot of them seem to be bemoaning his tactics as well. I think the further down the league pyramid you go, the more sheer grit, workrate and desire come into play to influence outcomes. 

Sounds like the reshuffle in defense was unwelcome news indeed. Nonetheless the highlights seemed to show a few reasonable attempts at goal and if just one of them had gone in maybe the match could have ended differently. Sounds like this was no dominant display though.",185,2016-03-06

Who do you want to see relegated ? I mean this in both from the Premier league down into the Championship and from the Championship to League 1.

Here are my picks

Premier League:- 

Newcastle because of Mike Ashley, Steve McClaren and how poorly they are being run. Shows that it isn't just us who gets done-over by big names on big wages that don't care. (Might not be good for us next year because I'm sure they would go straight back up).

Sunderland because of the Adam Johnson (he should not have been playing - how many games did his performance produce a  win or draw for them - what would the league table have looked like last year if he wasn't playing - would they have been relegated ?) and having the Gerodie/Mackem derby in the Championship.

Villa - cause they are going down... and I think the way they are at the moment they could drop down two leagues before they get it together.

Championship:-

Fulham because it would be funny and TBH it might destroy the club in the short term.... it's not like they have a dedicated following...

MK Dons because it never sat well with me the whole Wimbledon thing.

Bolton because we could raid them for all their youth players.",248,2016-03-09

No they don't, but they do it with a football club and that's very weird (meaning unique) because they feel a sense of ownership of a football club and that's a really difficult balance of how you try and engage with fans and make them, incorporated into some of the decisions of the club, {…}

Although Big T sometimes is a bit of muppet and gets taken advantage of by agents (and our own managers on occasion) I always feel like he doesn't see us as just consumers. He understands that it's like a family supporting a club and you care about what happens to it (and the players).

As ever with QPR the caveat is that it's evidently a hard club to manage due to deep-rooted systemic problems, so it's difficult to judge.

He still needs a pre-season to get everyone prepared to a level he's happy with and to shuffle personnel as he wants himself.

In my eyes he dropped the ball tactically twice and we were badly overrun in midfield, including in a disastrous home match against Fulham. Hopefully they were just isolated events though - prior to last night's draw, our ten match stretch under him was actually 6th best in the division.",116,2016-04-06

The pressure on JFH is to now replace Ale with skill.  You can't force a fan favourite unless you bring up someone from the past (aka Mackie) but if you can bring in a guy with strong skill at the position and willing to work hard, then the team is on the right track.

If you look at every team who's gone up in the last few years they've always had a few experienced players in the starting 11 and around the squad, the closest we have right now is Onuoha (who I don't think is much of a leader.

superhoops,"Newcastle are a shoo-in - they will blow everything and risk everything in order to get promoted next year. If they don't get promoted it could spell doom. Rafa is used to the Premier League and TBH the championship is a different kind of football so if he doesn't adjust quickly it could be a problem. But they will definitely have some of the best players in the league (although to be fair they didn't perform in the Premier League so what motivation will they have for the championship). They don't seem to have anyone except for Jamaal Lascelles who has any steel.

From what I'm looking at right now I think Villa will either be a mid-table team next season or do a blackpool and go straight down again. None of the players on their books at the moment (except maybe Jordan Ayew) are players that I rate or have experience of the championship.

Norwich will be fine but I don't expect them to go straight up next year - as with us going up and down (and up again) can be draining for the mentality of the players and I think they will look to have a settling year like us.",203,2016-05-19

Why do the FFP and the financial restrictions not seem to apply to Newcastle ? Is it that they are just going to send millions more paying the fines ?

I'm not jealous because I've seen us attempt to do it that way and it's blown up in our faces (and think the current model is a much wiser idea) but I'm just confused.",137,2016-06-01

superhoops,"[The last accounts Newcastle filed had them in profit](http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2016/04/15/newcastle-united-profit-reduced-wage-bill/), with a wage bill of £57m. Last season they bagged £72m from the Premier League before sponsorship and gate receipts. Unless Ashley is an idiot, they shouldn't go into next season in any kind of catastrophic situation where they're leaking cash they don't have.

[According to this article on parachute payments](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/how-much-aston-villa-parachute-11161706), Toon and Villa are lined up for £40m, £33m and £14m over the next three years. Norwich only get the first two as they yo-yo'd.

[Newcastle's average attendance last time round in this division](http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attnclub/newu.htm) was  43,388. Compare that to QPR's 15,994. Multiply each of those figures by 23, and you'll find that over a season they get 630k more bums on seats than QPR. At this level that's a significant financial advantage.

So large gate receipts, large parachute payment, not so much degenerate over-spending like QPR of yesteryear. Newcastle shouldn't have to stress about FFP for a while, and certainly not this season.

It's also furthest from the Q Block, so it's a bit less sweary.

If the kids are young it's nice for them to be near the front since the mascots hang around there before and after the game (and at half-time), but beware that the very front rows might get wet if it rains (the forecast is good for the weekend, but you never know).

As an aside, my little cousins are obsessed with [Kidzania](https://uk.westfield.com/london/entertainment/kids/kidzania?gclid=CjwKEAjwiYG9BRCkgK-G45S323oSJABnykKAiMyKobfWxHIA1JUhOkr9i_D0HwEUNAQkl5mxX8pfARoCxO7w_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) at Westfield.

superhoops,"The new season will be upon on in less than a week and I thought I would do a bit of digging to see what the differences are between Alex Smithies and Matt Ingram. For the purposes of comparison I also threw in Rob Green to give some indication of the differences that do exist. 

All of the statistics that I have used are from [WhoScored.com](https://www.whoscored.com/) and their 15/16 database, which I think is a great website to use. 

To start the comparison off, I looked at the saves that the three keepers made (per game)



Name| Apps | Mins | Total Saves | 6 yard box saves| Pen. Box Saves| Out of Box saves | Rating | Clean Sheets |
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Smithies | 18(1) | 1547 | 3.5 | 0.3 | 2 | 1.2 | 6.95 | 7 (39%)
Ingram | 4 | 360 | 2 | 0 | 1.8 | 0.3 | 6.84 | 2 (50%)
Green| 24 | 2142 | 1.9 | 0| 0.9 | 1 | 6.24 | 7 (29%)

Overall, it seems pretty clear cut that the goalkeeping improved Green being dropped. He seems to have had a rough time of it during his half season in goal. Both Smithies and Ingram seem to have been better at total number of saves and being more confident in the box (going by the number of penalty box saves). They also seemed to have a much higher rating as well. In part I think they benefited from a more stable back line, but the number of clean sheets that Smithies had really works in his favour. Smithies would appear to come out on top of the pile by quite a margin, with Ingram a little behind. 

Looking at the other side of the spectrum, passing! This is where things got a lot more interesting. I used the per 90 stat for these! 



Name | Total Passes | Accurate Long | Inaccurate Long | Accurate Short | Inaccurate short
---|---|----|----|----|----
Smithies | 30.6 | 8.2 | 21 | 1.4 | 0
Ingram | 34.8 | 9.3 | 24 | 1.5 | 0
Green | 31.4 | 10.5 | 19.2 | 1.6 | 0

Surprisingly here, Green seems to have the most accurate long kicks per game! (I still do not miss his horrible short kicks). Smithies and Ingram seem to be similar enough when you take in to account the difference in the number of kicks that they take (4.2 per game) and that's something that the stats don't explain.

What the stats don't show are some of the more intangible features, such as commanding the box and collecting crosses/corners. However, I think that the reason that Smithies saves more shots, is because he is better at organising the players in front of him. 

I guess I wrote this to get peoples thoughts heading in to the new season. I think Smithis is the clear number 1 for Leeds, but Ingram is young and hungry, and I'm happy that we have options at goalkeeper, so even with a long term injury, we should be covered. What do other people think? Is this useful?",525,2016-08-03
superhoops,"Good post, very interesting. It's a shame stats don't show difficult and straight forward saves. Smithies does look good, but I think our attack focused approach under Ramsey left us short in defense - thus leaving Green a more challenging stint as a whole.",44,2016-08-03
superhoops,"I forgot to add that there are next to no stats for goalkeeper mistakes outside of prem stats!

superhoops,"Hello!

So I've had some free time today and did a statistical digging on our win over Leeds! I picked these stats from WhoScored again. 

The match stats were as follows:


Stats | QPR | Leeds
---|---|----
Shots | 15 | 8
Shots on target | 8 | 0
Pass % success | 70% | 74%
Aerial Duel success | 50% | 50%
Succesful dribbles | 4 | 8
Tackles | 17 | 14
Possession | 44% | 56%

I found it a little surprising that outside of the shots and shots on target, we seem to have been level pegging with Leeds throughout the match. Happy with the tackles as well, especially as our top tackler was Massimo Luongo with 6. 

The whole team chipped in defensively, which fits with the idea that we're working more like a unit and that JFH's tactics are paying off. Nedum led the team with 5 interceptions with Karl Henry just behind with 4. Caulker had 4 clearances to pace us , and shows a nice balance between the central defence and full backs. 

What was also interesting was that we created 7 attempts on goal from set pieces, something that I feel we've been a little poor on in the past couple of seasons. And it was even more pleasing to get that goal in the 4th minutes off of a corner. It's nice not having to deal with Matty Phillips' delivery! We also had 17 interceptions and hopefully that sort of number carries on over the season! 

What was also somewhat interesting was the difference in passes attempted, our 317-409. However, we pumped in 21 crosses to their 22, something that I feel really showed on the day, especially with Shomide who had 6 attempts and Chery who had 10. What is also very promising is that we seem to have cut reliance on the long ball, only attempting 75 over the course of the 90 minutes. 

A final note, we seemed to have preferred attacking down the left, the heat map on the WhoScored website bears this [out](https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1084872/Live/England-Championship-2016-2017-Queens-Park-Rangers-Leeds#heatmaps).

And on a final note, a light hearted Rob Green [Stat!](https://twitter.com/QPR_Stats/status/762398340189487104) 

Again, I don't know if anyone will find this useful/interesting, but I'm happy to look over these things! I find them weirdly fun! 

Hope that we carry on our early season form!  ",391,2016-08-09

Statistic | Cardiff | QPR
---|---|----
Shots | 9 | 9
Shots on target | 1 | 2
Pass success % | 73 | 76
Aerial Duel Success % | 49 | 51
Dribbles won | 2 | 2
Tackles | 13 | 6
Possession | 50 | 50

Overall, the stats suggest that the match was much closer than the Leeds game. From what I've read and heard, we were set up in a much more compact shape, happy to absorb the pressure. 

This is borne out in the number of clearances that our CB pairing made in the match, 18 in total, with Caulker (pretty much a unanimous man of the match) making 14 of those. We managed to deal with their crosses very very well and didn't seem to be too flustered. I think this is also reflected in the relatively low number of tackles that we made in the match, 6, with the majority coming in midfield, with Luongo yet again leading the team, this time with 4 completed tackles. Luongo also lead the team in passes, at 52, so he does seem to be growing in importance and works well beside a midfielder like Henry who just presses. He wasn't the most accurate player however, with that honour going to Henry, who made 51 passes at an 86.3% clip! 

Picking up on what was written up on [LFW](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/news/43530/qprs-golden-start-continues-in-cardiff--report), we also registered 11 blocks, with our guys getting in the way of shots, which is great to hear and see! 

On a slightly more worrying note, we lost possession a lot more than our opponents, losing it 28 times to their 17. I think this may be more to do with our shape and style of play away from home, where we will be set up to be difficult to beat, if not to win the game by playing really attractive football. If we keep picking up points though, I'm not going to complain! 

Our trend of being dangerous off of set pieces carried on this match, with us generating 5 attempts from set pieces. Having been relatively ineffectual over the last couple of seasons, this is also a nice positive change. 

Caulker netted our goal obviously, from a lovely delivery from Bidwell, and hopefully we will see him score at least a couple more from those situations. We also saw Polter earn us a penalty, and Chery convert. Chery and Caulker both paced the side with 3 shots each, and it's good to see Chery be involved. 

Overall, a good team performance, and an aggressive one, with our team picking up 4 cautions, but it's early days and nothing to be too unduly worried about. 

Finally, despite mentioning that we were set up in a deep formation, the heatmap shows us being all over the pitch and just outside of our [box](https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1084879/Live/England-Championship-2016-2017-Cardiff-Queens-Park-Rangers).

Onwards to Barnsley, a team we've beaten in our last 6 encounters in all league competitions!

superhoops,"Just to add a bit more to this (as I'm bored at work at lunchtime...)

**Attack**

We are yet to score a goal from open play, with 4 goals coming from set pieces and 4 from penalties. 

We also are last in the league in crosses per game (15), which, with Polter as our starting #9 I thought wouldn't be the case, although he does seem to be a lot better with the ball at his feet than he might at first appear. To compensate though, we're fifth in long balls per game (84) which is when we pump the ball up to Polter so he can get our midfielders involved. 

We seem to favour attacking down the right side slightly more than the left (41%-37%), with a much lower preferences for the middle (21%  of attacks). I think this ties in well to the way in which we have fluid wingers and attackers, Chery being an exampe who likes to roam the pitch. However, interestingly, the majority of our shot attempts come from the middle (59%) rather than any other side, but that does put us near the bottom (18th out of 24). 
We are dead in the middle of the table for where our shots come from, with 5% of shots coming in the 6 yard box, 52% in the 18 yard box and 43% from outside, placing us 12th, 12th and 11th compared to other championship sides. 

**Defence**

Another interesting tidbit, we're currently 4th in the league in the amount of yellow cards we have conceded with 9 and an extra 4 listed as 'other' (I assume this is timewasting). Although we are 21st in the amount of fouls we give away, 10.2 a match, which is interesting considering the amount of yellows we then receive! 

As we seem to be a lot better at set pieces, we also have a very god CB pairing and are getting more sound defensively. We are currently 4th in the league in aerial duels won per match at 24.4 (Ipswich are top with 35.6) which stands is in good stead moving forward. What is also interesting, is that we have concede a fair few goals from shots on target, currently we only make 1 save per game... putting us dead last in the division. 

**Conclusion**

I think the picture we get is that we are a tight unit at the back, with two CBs good in the air and a settled holding midfield pairing to protect them in Henry and Luongo. We seem to be a lot lot better at set pieces, both in attack and defending them, which is a welcome change. with the midfield that we have, I think it's only a matter of time until we start scoring from open play, and putting that ball in the box for Polter may be the way to do that now. We have a very fluid attacking midfield and with the additions of Sylla, Wszolek and N'Gbakoto  with Chery could stand is in very good stead. Neddie is the 7th best ranked defensive player in the league with Caulker in 13th and if they can keep up their early season form, we should be a very very tough team to beat. That's enough rambling from me!

superhoops,"I've taken points from video if you don't have time to watch. Hopefully this gives some insight. 

- Only missed out on one signing - won't mention who
- Yeni was first target - talks were complicated for various reasons - other clubs, people in his ear etc
- Sylla's a goal scorer, strong in the air, team player, more to his game - expect him to score a few
- Furlong - easy decision to loan him out, wanted him to make the step up but wasn't better currently than Perch or Ned
- Doughty - he's 23, was going to be one of 5 mids, couldn't be guaranteed first team football and wanted to go out on loan himself. Hoping he'll improve and he may be able to come back and challenge for a place next season. 
- Cole Kpekawa - Didn't want to lose him, but felt it was the best thing for his career. Got to the point ""you can bring a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"" - fitness/disciple issues. 
- Club doesn't publish transfer fee's to keep their spending close to their chest so agents etc can't take advantage
- Club has been working hard to reinstate right attitude/values through, work ethic, pride, etc throughout the club
- Les said we're looking for Professionalism from players
- Sandro - had issues when he first come back from Holiday, but has been working hard/good attitude every since. JFH's going to give him a chance provided he stays professional (which he has been doing). 

- Training Ground - only two residents have put in for judicial review. If it's rejected, they can move forward in four weeks. If it's granted the process can take 9 months to work through. LH feels confident we're nearly there - expected licence for work to be granted in 2-3 weeks. Judicial review is last hurdle. 
- Stadium - First huge win was planning permission for developing houses. It's a vital piece for us to move forward with the stadium. I Think this basically means that if we aren't granted the stadium permission, we'll pull our house development. 
- Car Giant - we've got planning permission so that's all we're concerned about. If there's an alternative, we'll look at that. 
- Redeveloping Loftus Road - LH said it's not possible due to size of land/area around. 
- Loftus Rd Facilities - location of Family stand - Only 399 season ticket holders misplaced from where family stand has gone. We've now got 1039 season ticket holders in the family stand. If we were to move them, he doesn't know where. 
- High percentage of season ticket holders are 50 and above, low percentage are below 40, so we need to work on the demographic to bring younger fans in. Wants to make club personal & about the fans. 
- Drinks prior to Kick Off - issue is regarding licencing. Can't drink within site of the pitch, can't drink within 10mins of kick off or 20mins before end of game. 
- LH Thinks that there are ways to do safe standing at games, but the FA have issues with it. Germany has standing sections that work well, but Europe, UEFA has rules in place to ensure everyone is seated. 
- Names on back of seats - right now we're not getting the basics at the stadium done (fixing toilets etc) so we want to focus on that. Not ruling it out, possibly have a premium section where ticket holders can pay a bit more to be able to offset the cost to the club.

- Club finances - have to tip your hats to the owners for turning the 160mil of debt into equity and taking the correct steps to sort out finances going fowrard.
- Fan base - 1993 Club finished 5th in PL, but average attendance was only 15,015. Our attendance is actually better now than back then. Praises those who have stuck by the club through thick and thin.
- Forever R's/Kick up the R's - chap got up and rambled for about 10 mins about giving money to previous club players. Lee Hoo's asked for him to provide figures (had apparently asked for this before), but the guy couldn't provide it. Some others asked the guy to wrap it up, Lee tried to talk to everyone about hearing him out/respecting one another, the guy then cut him off with some back handed comments. Rambled some more then asked for Lee to come back to him. 
- JFH - Would we be happy with a top 6 finish - Jimmy replied he always wants more. If we're up to the PL standard now -We're not good enough for the PL as we're in the championship. 
- Cousins - JFH see's him in the middle of the park. Playing on the right because of circumstances and because he's versatile. 
- LH - Horrible fence at Stadium - Council do not want people to be able to go into that end. He's working on it. Council issue is the migration between stands. 
- Away fans tickets different colour - looking to do this going forward, already had stack of old tickets we had to get rid of. 
- Away fixtures (Newcastle then Blackburn) looking at options about whether the team comes back or stays up North. Football league trying to eliminate mid-week fixtures altogether. The club can't do anything about the long distance trips. 
- Grassroots football - no scouts at their games etc but other clubs are there. Les - We're trying to improve our scouting within London.
- Names on seats - old badge was taken off so people who had names on their seats were taken off at the same time. 
- Atmosphere - club can't really influence this. LH referenced Palarse Ultras section and how they had limitations put on them by the club. He's happy to listen to suggestions if people think there's something that will improve the atmosphere. LH wondered if people who were relocated from the Lower Loft would be happy going into the upper loft (where there are mainly non-season ticket holders) to try and raise the atmosphere up there. 
- Les mentioned that the fans energise the players - this has changed since he was playing as people come to games expecting to being entertained. 
- JFH - emphasized the importance of fans supporting ALL the players, especially the young kids - they need the extra support. 
- Disabled supporters - coach tickets for carers were taken away. LH said he'll look into it. QPR way below wheelchair seating compared to other clubs - LH will look into it.
- LH's is disappointed people have contacted the club and no-one's got back to him. 
- Players brought in have to compete for places - not just brought in as cover. 
- JFH asked if he regrets joining as he looks more stressed. He said he tries to stay as calm/enjoy the game as much as possible - but it's a bigger club etc so there are different expectations from Burton.
- Yeni - can play right/left and striker. Depends match by match where he'll' play. 

- LH pleased with all the photos everyone sent in for redo-ing the tunnel. ",1219,2016-09-07

Henry has failed to perform in the midfield in the last three games, he should be an off the bench player at this stage.  If we can't play through the middle we'll never be successful.  What made it worse was having three new players in the squad who have yet to settle, playing against one of the best teams in the division.  There were a number of reasons the result came out this way, we can definitely recovery, but we are finally starting to drift into the pack and a win is becoming increasingly important.",121,2016-09-14

I'm going to cross-post this there as it's always good to see the other set of fans opinions etc on the match and obviously not many of us saw the match.

Sorry to see Perchinho go off injured, any word on how long it's for? ",53,2016-09-14
superhoops,"I was there. It was terrible. But I think it's worth trying to dissect the match from last night. Were we just unlucky to catch Newcastle in great form? Or were we set up badly? I think it's a bit of both, with the added caveat that we were missing our two key players - Luongo and Polter.

The statistics make horrendous viewing




Statistic | QPR | Newcastle
---|---|----
Shots | 7 | 29
Shots on target | 3 | 12
Pass success % | 76% | 80%
Aerial Duel Success % | 39% | 61%
Dribbles won | 4 | 1
Tackles | 16 | 14
Possession | 50 | 50

Some of those are even very misleading, the possession statistic doesn't do justice to what Newcastle did to us and how poor we were. A lot of our possession was between the backline, without any real aim. This is where Luongo would have been very useful, he's the engine that drives us forward, without him, Cousins and Henry just look awful. Lots of side to side passing with no aim. I also have to admit that the ball found itself at the feet of Onuoha and Caulker far too often... Our best passing defenders are both Bidwell and Hall. 

The shot disparity pretty much sums up the game for those of you who weren't actually there, we were on the back foot after the first 5 minutes and never really recovered. We were facing a shot pretty much every 3 minutes (nearly). Our whole line-up had a very defensive sound to it, with 5 defenders starting, but we were more open tonight than against any other team we have faced this season and it showed. We lined up in a 4-4-1-1, a lot of our problems started with the midfield and forward line being miles apart - leaving Shelvey - totally free to dominate us. I think the first time we fouled him was in the 83rd minute. This was borne out in the statistics, with Newcastle having committed 15 fouls to our 6. Very poor - we just didn't disrupt their flow. Our aerial % is also miles off from the usual, and that's because Newcastle ran at us time and time again. They also had a big strong presence up top with Mitrovic - not too far from what we try to do with Polter. 

We were also poor defending set pieces as well, both Hanley and Clark, two CBs, scored. 

**(Some) Analysis**

There are no good statistics to pick out here at all. But I think JFH got it very wrong with his tactics. We set up in a formation we haven't really utilised and had Washington playing in a Polter like fashion, with no success whatsoever. He was slow to react to changing the system, with Sylla only coming on when we were 4-0 down. Polter is key to the manner in which we play as he throws his body around and works like a 'first' defender. Washington just doesn't have the same presence, and cannot compete for the high balls or hold up play as well, he's much better to us out wide or running behind the defence, something that wasn't going to happen with that tall physical Newcastle back line. 

Second, the midfield seems listless and too far from the forward players, and it has for a couple of games. Luongo has been the midfielder we have been relying on to battle, win back the ball and run at the opposing team. Henry and Cousins aren't as assertive and that's really showed in the last couple of games, Blackburn was just as bad. 

I'm not saying that we would have won 3-0 with those two in the side, but I think they're the ones who play with real fire in their belly and get players involved. Chery was totally isolated and ineffective, and that's because he didn't have that forward/midfield support from Polter and Luongo, who complement Chery so well. #NoPolterNoParty

We were also unlucky to face a fully realised Newcastle team that had won 5 on the bounce before last night. Mitrovic and Perez form a partnership that is way too good for this league. Mitrovic twice beat Onuoha at RB (I keep tearing my hair out when he's played at RB) with pace to cause havoc in our box, resulting in two goals, with Shelvey burying one and Perez the other on the second chance. Perez himself tortured us all game long and Shelvey was the MOTM capped with that fantastic goal (no one in a country mile to put any pressure on him though). They seem to be clicking on all cylinders and are simply too big a club for this league. 

Worst league defeat in our history and the first time we have shipped six in the league since 1963 v Coventry (6-3)! I think there is no way but up from here, and I still have some faith in JFH as long as he learns from this. We need a huge huge reaction against Huddersfield, but that will be a tough ask with them full of confidence even after losing to Brighton. Does anyone else have any thoughts? 

Onwards and upwards I guess! 

I also was there till the end, I dont know why!

I've been pondering how we can go two up top but, like JFH said, that would either mean putting Chery out wide or on the bench.  If Polter goes down again we really should consider putting Chery out wide, we've done it before and it has worked out.  Anyways, here we go:

--------------Ingram*-------------

Onuoha---Lynch---Hall----Bidwell

---------Cousins---Luongo--------

Phillips is still working out on the wing, creating chances as irregularly as he did when he was with us.

Austin though, has really hit form again with Southampton.  Scoring with regularity once again, both domestically and in Europe. Showing his natural goal scoring talent, really proud he's finally broken into the first team.

Tickets are reserved for 'members' first - you could become a member if you like but it's about £35 or so, plus you then have to pay for the tickets on top of that so may not be worth it.

superhoops,"Hey guys, Mintyfresh here. 

As some of you guys may know from seeing me post around here occasionally, I am an American university student that has followed the club for the last 6-7 years now.   

I recently found out I will be coming to London for 5-6 months of study, starting in January (unfortunately I'll be in the east of the city and its about a 40 min tube ride to LR)

I had few questions about seeing the R's play, and was wondering if anyone had any thoughts

First, how easy is it to get tickets?  I think I remember seeing the Newcastle game was sold out, could I reasonably expect to get tickets for most home games without a season ticket or membership?  

Also, what games do you guys recommend going to?  Right now I like the look of Fulham on Jan 21, Huddersfield on Feb. 11 and Brighton on Apr 8 (although I will probably end up going to as many home games as possible).  I also imagine I'll sample some prem games if I can tickets.  I'll be right near the Olympic stadium so maybe I'll see a West Ham game or two (although I've heard its not that enjoyable an experience)

Other than football, do you guys have any suggestions of fun things to do both in the city and elsewhere in the country?  I'll be traveling quite a bit with other friends around Europe, but I'd love to spend a lot of time really getting to know the UK.

superhoops,QPR have added Curtis Fleming to their backroom staff as First Team Coach,13,2016-12-15
superhoops,"Seems sufficiently close enough to January to start talking about this.

First of all I just want to discuss our summer transfers, how they are getting on, and whether they have a long-term place in the team.

Ariel Borysuik.  Niggling injuries have largely kept him away from the first team with any sort of consistency.  A change in manager seems to have lost him some favour as well.  However, during his spells across Luongo in the midfield he showed the necessary quality to cement a place in the first-team.  Shows good positional awareness, physicality, tackling and is known for his ability to hit them from afar.  To me, Borysuik was always the next iteration of Henry and that type of player pairs well with Luongo.

Joel Lynch.  Has had his own fair share of niggling injuries and didn't do enough to supplant Onuoha or Hall as a starting CB.  Has seen time in the team due to injuries, but those often meant playing in an unnatural position.  Has shown flashes of ability and is worthy of a spot on the bench for now until an injury to Hall or Onuoha gives him the opportunity to stake his claim in the starting XI.

Jake Bidwell.  Can you believe he is only 23?  Probably the best addition of the entire window.  Was kept out with a shoulder injury but has otherwise been a lock in the first team and a pleasure to watch at LB.

Jordan Cousins.  Another one who has dealt with injury since his arrival at the club.  Was unfortunately situated on the wing for a majority of his apps but when played in the middle seems a different player entirely.  Has an abundance of energy and arguably played his best game for us in our most recent loss to Derby.  Is developing well as a player and will continue to feature in the squad.

Yeni N'Gbakoto.  Started off well in the squad but was sidelined for a considerable time due to a personal issue.  A niggling injury kept him sidelined as well.  Both issues since resolved he is making his way back into the squad and put in arguably his best performance in a Hooped jersey against Derby.  The unfortunate lack of wingers in the team, now provided by wing backs under Holloway, could diminish his usefulness in the squad.

Idrissa Sylla.  Striker is a position we are poor in and Sylla possesses the best scoring record at the club.  Deserves more of a run in the first team.  Neither Washington or Polter are in any sort of form currently.

Pawel Wszolek.  Was likely added for depth at the winger position after the loss of Hoilett and Phillips in the summer.  Given the absence of N'Gbakoto was gifted a chance with the first team.  Is part of the Polish national team and has done well in his appearances with us so far.  Has competition with N'Gbakoto who also plays on the right and a lack of wingers in the midfield further diminish his chances of breaking into the first team once again.

The last one is not an addition but rather a youth player who has come onto the scene with QPR in a big way this season.  Olamide Shodipo.  Plays on the left and has shown genuine hunger for the game.  It is nice to finally see us not having to go into the transfer market to replace a player.  Has not benefitted from Holloway's insistence of playing with a midfield three but occasionally makes an appearance off the bench.

I'm really pleased with the transfers we made in the summer and think they all still have a chance to come good.  Although our formation inhibits the wingers specifically, there may still be hope yet.  With that out of the way, let's talk about January.

Sandro and Henry need to go.  In addition to that both of their contracts end come the summer.  If we are going to get anything for them January is our last chance.  Gladwin should go out on loan.  Simply put he is not yet at the level required to be a Championship player.  In this scenario we would look to acquire another midfielder to go with Luongo, Cousins and Borysuik.  We also need to pursue a RB at a similar level of Bidwell.  This RB should also be able to cover at LB if possible.  Perch just doesn't cut it.  He can provide cover at RB but he really doesn't do enough game-in game-out for us to challenge promotion.  So, three out and two in, simple.

superhoops,"I'm not worried, from what I saw today the biggest thing we are missing is a bit of quality.  I think we could be far worse off than we are currently, even though it might not seem like it.

superhoops,"We'll either need to replace him, or get Sandro playing properly. Henry is a limited player but he's useful. Defensive midfield is not a position we're strong in, as yesterday's game illustrated. Cousins is poor off the ball and Ipswich found too much space in front of our defence. Ollie tried to fix it by bringing Ned on and moving Grant Hall to midfield, but having our best defender in midfield is not a proper solution. We've brought Doughty back from loan, but we will still need to bring in someone with experience to play there. 

Henry is much maligned but the truth is that quality players who can provide what he does are difficult to come by. You don't find a Shaun Derry every day. Henry is poor on the ball and he has a lot of technical shortcomings, but he's a bit underrated by our fans. The nature of his game means that he gets better in adversity, against superior opponents (in other words, when he doesn't have the opportunity to cock up our possession football). His best games for us were in the Prem. He has the ability to see where the opposition is looking most dangerous and apply himself there to bolster our most vulnerable area. That was notable in its absence yesterday, when during the first half Ipswich swarmed the right flank without Cousins or Manning doing much to stop it. You need a leader in that area to either put out the fire or organise those around him to do so. Cousins does a lot of shouting and pointing, but mainly just chases the ball around without any positional sense. ",276,2017-01-03

superhoops,"First of all we start with [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84DvWBzGFjA). Definitely has some flair to his playing style, something we've been lacking.  Matched with his signature back flips he could be the spark our atmosphere needs.  Operates as a left winger which, as a result, means Shodipo and El Khayati are likely to see less of the pitch.  Worryingly he has only managed 43 minutes of game time this season, due to a knee injury that required surgery in September.  In fact since his introduction at Brighton six years ago he has rarely averaged more than a half on the pitch.  At Brighton he scored about one goal per ten games and his assist rate was worse than that.

Regardless, he likely comes into the team as our first-choice left winger.  He has a half decade of Championship experience and Holloway managed his brother at Blackpool so he may feel as though he knows what he is getting.  We are definitely a more right-sided team with the likes of Ngbakoto, Mackie and Wszolek so it is nice to see us add an experienced option on the left.  Although I believe we are in need of a central midfielder and a right back (and now a striker given the impending loss of Polter), I am excited by the prospect LuaLua offers.",217,2017-01-10

Now, Polter was here on a 3-year deal and works his socks off when on the pitch.  His obvious weakness was technical ability but made up for that with good hold-up play and getting onto headers in the box.  The only good reason for shipping Polter out was if we made money on his transfer.  If we didn't, well, I have to ask whether we are really that strapped for cash that we need to sell a player for a loss just to free up money to bring in someone else?  That is just bad business in my opinion.

Doughty, who we've just recalled, probably deserved a spot in the first team but was judged by JFH to not be of sufficient quality.

Now we've sent out Borysuik on loan, without first confirming personal terms with Goss.  This seems like a pretty haphazard move.  At least we are not losing him permanently. ",106,2017-01-26

superhoops,"So far we've managed to capture a winger and midfielder.  We've brought back Furlong and Doughty from loan and immediately put them into the team.  Unlikely now that we'll be pursuing a right back.  Polter is gone, leaving us with just two first-team strikers.  Another striker needs to be top priority.  I'm amazed we let Polter go without a replacement waiting in the wings.  One injury and our options get limited fast.

It's not just that though, one injury anywhere and we face a similar situation.  With Hall and Caulker both out we have no cover at CB if either Onuoha or Lynch go down.  What's worse is Lynch, in his relatively short time with us, has a history of minor injuries that have kept him out of the team. I'd expect loaning in a CB to be a priority as well.

Even our midfield is potentially fragile.  Luckily, even with Cousins out injured and Borysiuk loaned away we still have some depth.  We are really lacking experience though in Manning, Doughty and new signing Goss. An injury to Luongo would be all that is needed to throw the midfield into disarray.  You might be thinking, well Mackie can pitch in where needed.  That is true, and even though he's had a run of games for the first time in a long time, his rampant injury history cannot be overlooked.  A loan signing of a certain Morrison would be a smart move.

With the actual threat of relegation from the Championship looming, our current position seems somewhat precipitous.",258,2017-01-29
superhoops,"I think that's a fair assessment. It'd be easier to figure out what we need if we knew what style we are trying to play. Sylla doesn't contribute much apart from his goals, so if he's up front (and I don't see what choice we have) then the key signings would be a defensive midfielder to make interceptions and launch counter-attacks via the wingers, and a number 10. If Goss lives up to expectations then he can distribute from the base of midfield, but we still need a ball-winner with experience. 

We're basically trying to play the same counter-attacking way we did under Warnock - solid in defence, strong on the flanks (Mackie, Routledge, Kyle Walker), a CM partnership of a ball-winner and a distributor (Derry and Faurlin) and a talented number 10 to exploit the space in the middle once the wingers have stretched the play (Taarabt). If that's what Holloway wants, then we need the ball-winner and the number 10. ",162,2017-01-29

Overall, seems a solid transfer window.",417,2017-02-01
superhoops,"Great window IMO. Got some decent players in and some excess ones out.  Only worry is that we're still a little short in the back, Hall being injured means we're already down to our last two CBs (although im not sure if Caulker is still here or not?)

Here's what I think our best lineup will look like (with everyone healthy, also some of this is pure speculation)

GK: Smithies
RB: Furlong
CB: Onuoha and Lynch
LB: Bidwell
CDM: Luongo and Goss
CAM: Morrison
LW: Freeman
RW: Wszolek
ST: Smith

As I'm typing this up I'm realizing how many attacking options we have now.  The whole point of adding Smith was to play with two strikers, but who in that three man midfield gets dropped?  And thats still excluding Washington, Sylla, LuaLua, Mackie, Manning, and Yeni.  Definitely will be interesting to see what Holloway does.

superhoops,"I've been having a look at him since he's got the number 10 shirt.

South Africa Rd has the best seats in the house but it tends to be very quiet over there so it depends on your preferences.

superhoops,"Hello,

So I have been planning to finally travel to London from Finland to watch a actual live match(es) at Loftus Road. I was thinking of 4th of March vs Cardiff and 7th of March vs Barnsley, this is basically the only way i could see two matches (in which we have quite good chances of winning) within one reasonably long/short visit. Do you guys think it is worth staying the 3 extra nights (costs about 300-400€ more staying in a hotel) to see a midweek fixture? I don't really mind that extra time since there is quite a lot of stuff to do in London. I have seen different opinions of those midweek fixtures, some saying they have a good and different atmosphere and some saying the stadium is quite empty. If you think the midweek game isn't worth the extra money, is the match vs Cardiff the one I should be looking at or are there some other fixtures (vs Brighton perhaps?) I should consider?

Which are the go-to seats I should be looking at when booking the seats? My main priority would be a good view at the middle-ish areas of the stands, so that would narrow the choices to the seats at Ellerslie rd or South Africa rd. Since it will likely be another 2-3 years when I come and see a match again I don't mind possibly spending money on those platinum-graded seats at South Africa rd stand, but are they worth the money compared to the middle seats of Ellerslie rd? I have heard some horror stories about the huge pillars supporting the roof blocking the view, which are the seats to avoid these?

Is it allowed to have a small, pocket sized camera with me at the matches? I have seen quite a few vlogs filmed with those but I just wanted to make sure if any of you guys have any experience with this stuff.

And finally, if I stay that 5-night period, is the stadium tour worth considering?

For those too lazy to read:

Are QPR v Cardiff and QPR v Barnsley good games to watch, if not, which are? Is it worth spending extra 400€ on hotel to see a midweek fixture?

Which are the go-to seats positioned at the middle-ish area of the pitch?

Is it allowed to bring a pocket sized camera?

Opinions on the stadium tour?

There'll be a bit of formatting stuff so ignore that!

As with the previous couple of events, there wasn’t any groundbreaking news, but it was a very interesting evening with an excellent insight into the future plans for the club… The evening was very heavily focused on the finance side, with a deluge of questions being fired at Lee Hoos on the subject, but there were some fascinating little snippets, particularly with regard to Gary Penrice re-joining QPR, along with a squad update and news on the Stan Bowles benefit game.

In total, the question and answer lasted almost bang on two hours. Some of the questions were bounced back a couple of times during the evening, so for the sake of clarity I’ve compiled everything discussed under each header. Holloway apologised on a number of occasions for ""rattling off"" which made this a bit difficult to structure, but the below covers everything discussed.

The evening started by Paul Morrisey (PM) welcoming Lee Hoos (LH) and Ian Holloway (IH) to the room. Les Ferdinand was originally supposed to be in attendance, and whilst nobody at the club confirmed the exact reason why he wasn’t able to come, there was a lot of talk that it was due to a charity event that he needed to attend in Newcastle.

Paul Morrisey opened by asking Ollie how it felt being back at QPR.

**IH -** Going by championship sackings I might have another 5 months go go! Listen, I’m privileged and delighted to be back. On the way here, I was listening to a song “back together again” in the car. That’s how it feels for me. There’s been lots of changes compared to when I was last here. After those six defeats in a row everyone stuck with me, let’s see where we can go from here.

I want some proper hero’s at QPR again... People who will wear that shirt in the same way that all of us would. Ferdinand is a prime example of what we’re after, loads of potential and the right attitude. QPR gave him the platform to go on and do great things. I want to do the same for some of our youngsters here too.[/i]

**LH -**We’ve made good progress in the 2 years since I’ve been here. The average age has decreased considerably. We’ve re-balanced the squad really well and I’m pleased with where we are heading.[/i]

**TRAINING GROUND**
**Q: The judicial review found in favour of the council, so what’s the next steps?**

**LH -**We have won every legal battle that has been put in front of us. This review was in our favour, but this could still be appealed. The difference now is any appeal would only be an option on a point of law. This is very unlikely. 

As we mentioned previously, there has been an application for a public foot path going straight across the training ground, which is due to be reviewed in September.

This is something that we really want over the line. In amongst these appeals and legal processes, it seems to have been forgotten that we are putting things in place for the local community. We aren’t developing the land to build a load of property - we will be providing pitches that the local children and youngsters can go and play on. 

It’s unfortunate that so much money has been spent on legal fees. 

On the timescales, this has been going on for two years, just to get to this stage. I can’t put a definitive timeframe on it, but as long as foot path goes in our favour, then we are pretty much there. As has been the case previously, they may appeal again in September on the foot path, which would again lengthen the time until we can start work. Providing we overcome those hurdles, the first step would be to level off the site, and we have the license pretty much granted for that. So we will be able to start work as soon as it’s signed off. It’s looking good. [/i]

**NEW STADIUM**

**Q: Can’t we just develop Loftus Road?**

**LH-**This site is less than 5 acres. The sites we are looking at are already quite tight, and even then we are looking at 9/10 acres. Double what Loftus Road is. 

Aside from that, planning permission would never be granted on this site. The restricted light and other factors make is a non-starter. No matter how hard you try, we simply can’t do anything at Loftus Road. 

It’s extremely important for us to remain in the borough. A stones through from Loftus Road ideally.

**Q: What’s the latest on Old Oak Common?**

**LH-**It’s looking increasingly difficult, but it is still possible.

**Q: And what about the report on the Linford Christie site?**

**LH-**The Linford Christie site is very early doors. At the moment we have been going round and talking with people in the community and starting genuine consultation. We need to find out what people’s issues are and what they want for the area. If we got Linford Christie, the track would not go around the pitch. The facilities on the site are very poor, if it was possible to get a new ground here it would be mutually beneficial - we could give them far better facilities than they have now. 

QPR is the bedrock of the community. It’s an asset and should be viewed that way. We want the local people to be proud and want ground there.

**TEAM FOR NEXT SEASON**

**Q: What’s the plan on the playing side next season?**

**IH -**Wow. Togetherness is so, so important. We’ve had so much change over the last few years, and players haven’t been given a fair crack of the whip to build themselves.

January was a great month for us, it really was. We got rid of people who didn’t want to be here. I tried to get some of them on board, but that mentality wasn’t changing so we needed to get rid. 

The young kids have great attitudes, there’s real promise for the future now. We’re always looking at who we bring here, or should I say, who we allow to come here. 
It’s not about ability, you need to be worthy as a person first. I think that’s what we got wrong over the past few years.

Your favourite player… I would have fallen out with him. You HAVE to be a good person FIRST, respect the group FIRST. It’s a team game, selfishness has NO part to play in my squad. This is my house, you have to have manners. 

Some of our players over past few years didn’t deserve to wear the shirt. But they did a trick and everyone would say how amazing they are. Not for me.

It’s natural that some players you will get right, some you will get wrong. But the character of the person? You have to be right. Every time.

It’s difficult here at QPR because we all like a bit of flair don’t we? Les had flair - and heart. That’s the characters you need. 

You’ve got to get that blend right. Look at Connor Washington, the best thing that I could do for him was getting someone in who can win a header. He knew it, the squad knew it. He’s not a winger; he’s not a lone-striker either. Now he has partner, he believes he can score goals. And he’s showing it. 

Listen… Coming here and wearing that badge isn’t easy. If you aren’t scoring, or hitting that ground running some fans get on your back. 

“COME ON HOLLOWAY – GIVE IT TO WILKINS!”

*laughter*

You need a blend; I was a midfielder with Wilkins. That’s the bit you need to get right.

We could easily have panicked in January but we didn’t. It’s a terrible time to buy and sell. It’s tough when players are telling you that they want to leave. It’s not professional for me to speak on certain positions for next season, right now everyone is doing what’s asked. 

But I’m pleased how things are going. I would like us to score more goals, but I can’t complain. 

Long term, our scouting network is on the march. I won’t name names, but we are making massive progress. Everyone that’s good is ahead of the game. You need eyes on everyone in Europe. We need to find your Kante’s. What did he cost?

We aren’t gonna throw it around like we used to, but that didn’t do us any good anyway, did it? 

Whether you’re a tackler, a passer, a flair player, there’s never an excuse for not trying. And you’ve seen enough of those haven’t you? 

You might not like everyone that I bring in, but you won’t say aren’t trying!

**FAMILY STAND**

**Q: Can we move the family stand? What about putting them in the Paddocks? It’s ruining the atmosphere…**

**LH -**Move the kids along to the Paddock area? Firstly, the Paddocks are mostly season ticket holders, so I’m not sure how they would feel about this. If you want these kids to grow to love the club, sticking them out in paddocks probably isn’t the best way to go about it. People talk of atmosphere, but I don’t think it’s that bad. Last year against Brighton the place was rocking. Against Norwich it was superb too, for me the atmosphere is very heavily linked to what’s happening on pitch…

**IH-**You saying it’s my fault?!

*LAUGHTER*

**LH -**In a new stadium we could put the family stand in a better position. But at Loftus Road we are stuck with where it is.

**Q: It’s quite common for fans to be hit by the ball in the warm up, can this be addressed?**

**IH-**That is my fault, I do the shooting practice!

*MORE LAUGHTER*

**LH -**Next season that will be eliminated. We will have nets in front of where players warm up, we already have the footings in place.

**TARGETS FOR NEXT SEASON**

**Q: What’s the target for next season Ollie?**

**IH-**To be better than we were this year. Let’s target the top half of the table, if not playoffs. Everyone wants to be there, but let’s have a go. I touched on it earlier, but our scouting network needs to be better, we want better players here don’t we?

I visited Real Madrid when I was out of work - as I normally am! 

*LAUGHTER*

I was shown around by a little man called Paco. He didn’t speak a word of English. The facilities were absolutely stunning, beautiful. They had a surgical operating theatre by the training ground. It was unbelievable. A palace. 

We had lunch and watched them all train train. Through the interpreter, Paco turned and said to me… all you really need is one pitch, one ball, and bloody good players!

*LAUGHTER*

**BURTON FIXTURE**

**Q: Moving forward the Burton game looked a good idea… But why rest the players?**

**IH-**I hold my hands up to that one, that was my fault. Speaking to Birch quickly, he’s saying we should bring it forward. I didn’t realise it was so close to the window and had I known I would have left it as it was. We would have been stronger playing them on the Tuesday. Okay, we lost, so what? Would we lose if we played them again? I don’t think so. I was wrong in my management. I should have looked at it properly, but I take full responsibility on that one.[/i]

**ACCOUNTS**

**Q: How are things looking on the finances? We’ve cut the losses from £44m to £11m, that’s good news, right?**

**LH -**It’s the first time for me that an £11m loss has been celebrated as a success. Make no mistake; we have a very tough job ahead of us. In the future, it will be hard to sustain even this amount, and the parachute payments will be cut in half next season too. Then they totally stop shortly after that, so to keep even this level of loss is very difficult. We need to be faster and work smarter than other clubs. 

It comes back to what Ollie said, the importance of our scouting is critical. Other clubs can afford to make mistakes with transfers. We can’t. On that side, this January was probably the best transfer window I’ve ever been involved with since I’ve been in football.

**IH -**January was very good. We have some very big shoes to fill. We lost Charlie Austin and apart from, only Chery was getting any goals. Nobody else was scoring. It again comes back to balance and blend of experience and youth. Some of the young lads have been sensational, Manning and Furlong. Wow. This is what we all want.

United built an era on youth. I want to see the same here. Maybe I can manage young Furlong’s son one day. He hasn’t had him yet, but that’s what I want. 
*LAUGHTER*

We need to get the signings right. At Palace I paid £6m for Dwight Gayle. I’ll tell you, I was worried; he had only played for Peterborough. Fortunately, it worked out well. 

But I’m putting things in place that will keep you all happy for a long, long time. If you have that top, top knowledge you don’t have too much to worry about. 

I didn’t like the flashiness, that’s never been us. I’m told we need to move, but I don’t particularly want to leave Loftus Road, this place is special. Let’s make sure that we nurture the right kind of people to play for us. It’s already happening. Right now.

Some of them before weren’t here for the right reasons. The deals weren’t right. We don’t have that in us anymore, to make deals like that. 

The lower league scouting here was amazing once upon a time. I see Andy Sinton at the back there… Where did we get you from? Cambridge wasn’t it?
*Shouts of ""Brentford"" from various people*

**IH -**WHAT?! 

*laughter*

**IH -**Good old Brentford. I’ll tell you one thing about them though, their scouting network isn’t bad is it? We need to do the same.

**Q: Sticking with the accounts, can you give a forecast of how the next set will look?**
**LH -**I can’t give you a forecast, but I would say it will be roughly the same next year. It is harder though, as touched on with the parachute payments etc. We are showing foresight and looking ahead on all aspects at QPR.

**Q: Why is Reuben charging interest on money he has loaned to the club?**
**LH -**The loans that he puts in is open to anyone else that wants to contribute on the same basis. The interest is converted into shares in the club 

**STAN BOWLES BENEFIT MATCH**

**LH -**There’s a long and short answer here. Let me explain my job. Picture me as being employed to drive the van from one destination to another. I need to avoid hazards and make sure we are going on the right route. The passengers can look out the window and what is going on outside. I need to focus on keeping the club on the right line.

So far the GoFundMe page has raised £35,000 for Stan and his family. What is the objective of this benefit match? Is it financial? Is it recognition? 

We did the day for Stan / Alzheimer’s Society which was a great success and great for him. He got his acknowledgement and recognition. 

I’m not sure that the original group really knew what they were aiming for. Personally, I don’t believe Loftus Road is the right venue for the day. At these kind of events, they notoriously don’t have anywhere near the level of support they think they’ll get when the days comes. 

It’s not unfair to say that the previous committee didn’t gel together. I tried to get the right people that had experience in organising these kinds of events. We now have a superb team together doing this. 

One of the members organised a previous testimonial. There were massive tax implication to this, and one of them suggested doing it through the QPR Community Trust. This makes it VAT exempt, which automatically increased takings by 20%. 

I’m working 70 hours per week, trying to organise this kind of thing isn’t easy. We now have a structure; and I think we will have a date within the next 10/14 days.

**FFP**

**LH -**I’m hoping for this to be resolved by start of the season or just after the start of next season. I’m limited in what I can say, as they keep reminding me… But it’s going at real pace now, and will be resolved soon.

**TRANSFER BUDGET FOR NEXT SEASON**

**Q: What’s the transfer budget for next season?**

**LH -**No club in their right mind would disclose that kind of information! We don’t want to tell every club how much we have to spend!
*laughter*

**INJURY UPDATES**

**Q: Can you keep us more updated on player’s injuries?**

**IH -**I hear what you’re saying, but things aren’t always clear cut on injuries. Jordan Cousins was close to coming back, and then he complained of a bit of pain, and turned out he had ripped the muscle right off the bone. Jack Robinson is still struggling with some older injuries that keep niggling him. It’s very difficult to know day to day how long each will take.

LuaLua we thought was going to be out for weeks. I can tell you he will be out training with us in a couple of days time and be back way ahead of schedule. 

The other thing is that I don’t want to help the opposition prepare by saying who may or may not be available. That does us a disservice. 

I’ll tell you one thing though, this team is as sharp as any that I’ve managed over the past 10 years. The confidence is flowing and the belief is building all the time. It’s amazing. 

Against Norwich we had them down to 10 men, we’ve scored two goals and we’re absolutely terrified. If we went any deeper we would have been in the main road!

It took time to get that mentality out. Players need results and rules, when that blend is right they all believe in what we’re doing. We’re getting there.

**[b][u]TRAVEL &amp; SUPPORT AT AWAY GAMES**

**Q: Official coaches are very expensive; can’t the club arrange train travel for supporters? It more comfortable and it’s cheaper for supporters.**

**LH -**We already lose money on coach travel. Rail companies were previously offering deals to clubs where you could offer discounted travel to supporters, but they have stopped doing it now. We aren’t trying to make money on this; just covering the costs would be great.**

[b]Q: Could we get players to acknowledge fans more when getting off the coach at away games?**

**IH -**Personally, I’ll always stop and talk to anyone. But I don’t want to change the player’s pre-match routine. Each of them is different. Connor wants to get in the zone; he has his headphones on up until kick off. You wouldn’t believe how superstitious they are. We will do all we can for you, but changing things pre-match is something I’m not prepared to do. At any club events, believe me, they will chat and mix with everyone. But on a match day, players need to focus in their own individual way and I would never get in the way of that.

For me, when the game ends it’s absolutely vital to acknowledge the support. But sometimes when you lose you feel you have let everyone down. It hurts. 

Speaking personally, when we lost up at Rotherham a few weeks back, I didn’t want to go over and clap everyone. I was fuming. 

But I do want a group of people that feel like you do, for us to all be one. This group care, I know they do. They care about you. We need that message going through to everyone. When you have that you can achieve unbelievable things. 

“This is the best trip, I’ve ever been on… Do do dooo”

That’s what I want to hear the QPR fans singing. I want you to be proud. I want you to enjoy it. It won’t always go right, sometimes it will go wrong. The beauty with this league is you can lose a third of your games and still get promoted.[/i] 

**SCOUTING STRUCTURE**

**]Q: You’ve both mentioned a lot about the scouting, can you give us anymore info?**

**IH -**It’s expanding. I can’t tell you who’s coming because he’s working elsewhere, but he’s definitely coming. He has loads of experience and we’ve worked together for a long time. He’s never given me a bad character. He knows a lot of people, veey well connected… People in France, Spain, Portugal…. We will know everyone, everywhere. 

The investment needs be right here. Luckily for me the board have put this in place for us. It’s better for the club that he is here, than I’m here. Long term you will be thinking, wow, look at him. 

This particular person recommended that I signed Luke Freeman for £500k. He knew his contract situation and that he was under 24. We knew everything about him, he’s a fantastic addition. 

The club have been after this individual for about 3 or 4 years now. He wants to work with me again, so he’s going to come. 

I guarantee to you, if he tells me to sign someone, I wouldn’t need to see him myself. He will be the right sort. If you don’t play him he will work harder, play harder. We need saleable assets. I’ve never been so confident in my life. 

Watford spend £2m a year just on scouts wages. Benatia, who’s now playing at Juventus, they paid £400k for him. I could have had him at Blackpool for £4,000 per week but they wouldn’t pay the wages. That was nothing for a player like him. He was then sold later on for £25,000,000! 

Every time I see him playing for Bayern I call Mr Oysten and say “You seen who’s playing?”

*LAUGHTER*

This same individual recommended that I sign him. That same person was involved with Kante and Mahrez. He found them. We won’t be too far off the pace.

It all feels right. I know how to do it. We have had some adversity. 2007 was excellent, because we came through a lot of crap didn’t we? It was horrendous, but we got there in the end. Then unfortunately I was put on gardening leave by a very unsavoury character... I can’t name names, but *cough* Paladini *cough*

Oh, did I just say that?

*HEAVY LAUGHTER*

**OTHER QUESTIONS**

**Q: What reservations did you have about returning to QPR?**

**IH -**The only reservation I had was whether my wife would let me! I had to sit down and ask her if she would let me come. When you take over as a manager, it takes over everything, your whole life. It’s a big thing to give up. But Kim feels about QPR the same as I do. Fortunately. 

I almost had my time, but thank you, thanks to Kim, thanks to the club, it feels fantastic for me. Even in the bad moments I feel you trust me. 

We all want to get back in that top flight. But the top four keep getting all the money, keep growing, keep building. When you go up, you’re in danger of wrecking yourself by trying to stay there. It needs to be small steps, and for us to always think about the club first. We need to do it a bit at a time. 

You’ve put up with enough here haven’t you? It’s not about where someone comes from; it’s about where they want to go. What might Manning be worth in the future?

**Q: Can we have the ‘dennis the mennis’ kit back next year?**

**LH -**We can’t have it every single year, but it will come back at some point. Interestingly, the feedback on this year’s kit was amazing. Hoops all the way round, finally! We actually sold more the previous year with the hoops not going all the way round. I still can’t get my head around that following the reaction we received to it.

**Q: There’s still confusion over LF’s role, can you confirm what he does?**

**LH -**Oh, I wish LF was here! 

He ties all of the footballing departments together. He’s the first point of contact with agents. He’s a great person to have around the club, he’s a gem of a man to have on board. And it’s all done with a smile and no arrogance. Perhaps next time we do one of these we can get Les to run through a typical day of his to explain how his role works.

**IH -**Management is evolving. It used to be that the managers did everything, from the signings of the players to writing up the contracts. The amounts of money involved are enormous now, you can’t possibly do all these things yourself. Without Les I would have struggled to come back. 

It’s impossible for me to do my job properly if I was dealing with agents and all of the signings. His role is absolutely invaluable to me. He is vital in allowing me to organise my group. The other bonus for me is that he can be “bad cop” sometimes. If someone wants to sort contract they can go talk to Les - not me. He has huge role in what club will turn into. 

The deals here used to run out of control. Now we will go for the best option, if the deal isn’t right to for the club, then we move on to target 2,3,4. 

I also want Les on the training pitch, just half hour would benefit some of our lads no end.

**Q: With every referee against QPR, how do you feel about video assistance coming in?**

**IH -**This is a long time coming. It was the first time I’ve ever lost 1-0 after scoring a legitimate goal (Blackburn). The lino said it was impossible to see the header and be absolutely sure it crossed the line, so he didn’t give it. Our analyst knew straight away, it was mad! Referees should be able to have a personality, but the way I see it they are all turning into robots. They have a tough job, but with video replays it will at least be fair.[/i]

**Q: The “Stars of 67” Q&amp;A was a great evening. Can we do this more regularly please?**

**LH -**We will try and do more events. There is plenty going on behind the scenes. Problem is, if you have too many of these events it goes from being special to being the norm. We are very pleased with how many fans said that they enjoyed it.

**Q: Ollie, how much do you change tactics depending on who we play?**

**IH -**Yeah I change it a lot, I realised it wasn’t working when we lost 6 games in a row! We were too open, we couldn’t score, and we couldn’t defend. The lads weren’t comfortable with it, and we aren’t at a level where we can impose our game on any opposition and go and win.

At Leeds I totally changed it to nullify Wood. We shackled them and we should have won it. Before the lads couldn’t deal with changes, now we are winning they can switch it up and they’re comfortable with a few different systems. 

If teams start pressing and cutting out our passing, we can go straight to Smith and play from there. It’s a dying art, players like that. The players knew we needed it. Having him here lets the others grow. 

The foreign players are settling in now. Sylla, Yeni, Pawel… They haven’t been here long, two of them barely speak any English… Which is a good job because I don’t either! 

Some players have issues, if they aren’t on it I send them home to think about it and tell them to come back a different person tomorrow. Players can be spoilt, but that ain’t happening here. Not anymore. And we will benefit from it eventually. 

Look at Lukaku… Yeah he’s signing a new deal. Oh no, he isn’t. Everton don’t have any ambition, I’m not signing. It’s a selfish attitude and I don’t put up with that

**Q: Could the Blue and White bar be utilised better? Having Sky game on? Have a player in there after the game?**

**LH -**It’s difficult with players, they normally want to do their own thing after the game…

**IH -**I can force them to go in if you want? 

*laughter*

**IH -**Let’s have a look at this, it’s a really important part of things.
**LH -**A lot of the time those available players are over in the family zone, but we can see.

**Q: What are the club doing to encourage new fans to QPR?**

**LH -**Well the family zone has been a real success. A lot of kids are coming to the club. New season tickets holders is up to 78 this year, compared to just 3 last year. That’s not returning fans or lapsed ST holders. That’s 78 NEW fans. The interest free DD scheme has been taken up, and made it more affordable for a lot of fans to come back to Loftus Road.

**Q: What’s happening with Ravel Morrison?**

**IH -**I have 4 kids and they all needed to earn their ice cream. Ravel’s ice cream is that he just wants to play. His training isn’t always what it should be, and his timing isn’t always what it should be. 

He needs to earn his team mates respect and work hard as them. That wouldn’t have been hard few months ago, let’s be honest. But when Ryan Manning is running 14 km – 1,800 of it flat out. And then Pawel beats that… Poor old Rav has a way to go hasn’t he? 

I know his game isn’t all about running, but we need to hold the ball better for him to be effective. He’s gradually getting there. I looked into his eyes and thought I could help him, and that’s what I’m trying to do. He still has a contract at Lazio for another 2 years. But we have a clause to take him. It’s all about him proving he wants to do what he says. I want talented people around me and I want my work ethic to rub off on him. I’m sure he will do it, lots of other people have been sure and they haven’t been right. 

At the minute I don’t think he’s ever worked so hard. He’s training 3 times a day and he hasn’t let us down for… 3 or 4 days! 

*HUGE LAUGHTER*

**IH -**Deep down it ain’t funny though. You have to earn what you get. You want respect, you have to earn it. Other managers get sacked left, right and centre. They may not have those principles - and good luck to them. But you can’t run after these players wiping their backside. But I hope more than anything that I can see him play for proper. I promised his mum I would do my best to help him. I’ve only had one player before I couldn’t help and that was Clark Carlisle, and boy did I try. 

What a brilliant player Ravel could be. I love his ability. He might be in and around it on Saturday. We’ll see.

**Q: Who are the most exciting youth players coming through?**

**IH -**It’s hard to say individuals. I loaned out Shodipo, I want him to learn a bit more, make a few mistakes for someone else then come back. Just like Furlong has done. He has a serious chance though. He’s great with the ball at his feet and running at people. 

Grego-Cox and Petrasso have really impressed me. Doughty has stacks of ability; I just struggle to find a position for him. Lumley has been outstanding; they’re waxing lyrical about him down at Bristol Rovers. Furlong and Manning have been amazing. Everyone behind the scenes are working so hard, it’s fantastic. There’s others I really like the look of, but they aren’t physically there yet.

**Q: Where does the club stand with on the discipline of Steven Caulker?**

**LH -**Not an employer in the world that would comment on that. It’s internal and ongoing process. No further comment.

**IH -**He seems to get in trouble when he’s not fit. I would love to be able to pick him, he’s a brilliant player. He started the season on fire.

**Q: What’s happening with the outstanding bank loan?**

**LH -**It’s being repaid monthly and finishes in August.

**Q: The interest rate seems quite high on what Reuben has paid into the club. With parachute payments reducing, why is he taking money out of the club?**

**LH -**As I said earlier, we will give you the same deal if you want?

**IH -**I think this is a trust thing. They’ve had their hands burnt, let’s be honest. They’re now running QPR how they run their own businesses. I trust them. Les does. Lee does. These are nice people. They got caught up in it before and thought that’s the way football was. Reuben is a quiet man who’s determined to do well. He doesn’t go into this to “do” people. He’s a man of his word, and I want us to build a relationship, and for us to be proud. 

It’s not about what you spend, you can go and have a lovely meal in a café, right? If you choose it well. Some are minging, but some are nice!

I know what you have here, and in time this will give you what you want. But we need trust. They’ve lost millions on millions. My goal is to make them feel happy and good, who knows what comes then?

**Q: Could the club give up free tickets to local schools / the community for cup games? It would help boost attendance and atmosphere**

**LH -**The FA give you very few tickets to give away free. 45% of the revenue goes to us, 45% goes to the opposition and 10% to the FA. It’s crazy, but even if you give the ticket away, whether they show up or not we then have to pay the opposition and the league - even if you aren’t getting any money for the tickets. That’s why clubs don’t do it anymore, where in the past they included it in the ST price.

**Q: How good is Smithies?**

**IH -**WOW. I’ve played with some good goalkeepers, but Smithies is phenomenal. Ingram is excellent and never complains about lack of game time. The way that they work is incredible. We’re blessed with great goalkeepers here. Lumley as I mentioned is doing very well, and we have a beast of a lad in the youth team who looks a real prospect. Smithies signed a new deal recently... I imagine there will be offers for him this summer. Gilks was outstanding for me at Blackpool, but Smithies is topping him, and he’s younger. Good job too because I’ve never seen so many one on ones since I’ve been here!

*laughter*

**Q: Have you worked much on the fitness? The players looked noticeably sharper against Leeds?**

**IH -**Not so much, but we have more desire now. I did some running drills here, and I was shocked. Pawel got in the team because of how well he did - the best I’ve ever seen. Young Manning was the second best I’ve ever seen, so in he went too. It’s quite simple really. You need to be able to run when playing counter-attacking football. 

Some people didn’t want to run, some people couldn’t run. Sandro hadn’t run for ages. You can’t play counter-attacking football with that. But now they believe. Luke Freeman blitzes what we had before. All these elements come together and you get more energetic performances as a result. We go long to Smith far too often for me, but the players know he’s there as an option.

Birmingham away was the best I’ve seen from any team of mine. That was the day that the new boys came of age for us. The pressing, the desire, the quality. The free kick from Yeni, unbelievable. 

On Yeni, I found out what weight he was before he came to us. My fella who I’m bringing in on the scouting knew his ex-manager at Metz. So I knew he put on a lot of weight. He had a bereavement, he lost his father. He missed his flight, and by the time he got there his dad had passed away. How can you judge him on that?

I knew his body fat was nowhere near right. I showed him the calendar and said look at you there. Is that your twin brother? You eating his biscuits? He came my way, and he’s worked ever so hard.

*laughter*

No game in this league is easy. If you think we will just show up on Saturday and win, then don’t come. If they start moaning, shut them up. 

I lost to Vauxhall Motors, a terrible car I lost too! I never forget that. We’re on a mission to get you what you want. 

Against Huddersfield I was sat there waiting for someone to do something, then Freeman smashed that one in and we almost got back into it. I want those moments of magic more.

**LH -**Can someone tell our commercial man to cancel the Vauxhall sponsorship that we had lined up?

*laughter*

Paul Morrisey then presented a couple of fans signed ball and another with £100 of Rangers cash.

Holloway went totally off-piste and said we should do more QPR cash. “It’s all home made. Wouldn’t that be great! I want £2,000 of Rangers cash please? U R’ss.”

Paul Morrisey then went back to Holloway to sign off the evening.

superhoops,"So basically I don't usually give much attention to e-mails from EFL, but recently I had a survey for international EFL-team supporters (like me) sent and just for curiosity I proceeded to take the survey. There were questions like ''If EFL were to broadcast  *insert your EFL team here* matches live online, how much would you be willing to pay to watch them?'' and some follow-up questions about the broadcasts.

Has this happened previously or are they actually planning to perhaps give the clubs permission to broadcast their matches live in the future? I just remembered that we changed our media partner for the next season to ''provide better live-streaming capabilities'', coincidence?

If this would happen I think it would be absolutely fantastic for international supporters and the popularity of the whole league abroad because at least for me basically the only reason I really would like QPR to get promoted again is that I would be able to watch them play live more often (well obviously I would like to get us promoted anyway but you get the point).

superhoops,"I think we have a decent spine to the team. But there are changes that I would make, but not huge ones.

**GK** - Smithies/Ingram/Lumley as our three keepers - so even if we shift Smithies this summer, I'm not that worried. We're set at the position. 

**RB** - Furlong/Perch - I am always confused when I don't see Furlong's name on the team sheet, he should be one of the first on the list, he's consistent and shows a lot of promise, plus his dad sits in the same block as me... But Perch keeps making mistakes, and the more I watch him the more he scares me. He should be back up at this point and that's it. 

**CB x 2** - My starting pairing would be Hall and Nedum. They've been consistent players usually, and I still think Hall is better as CB than a CDM, although he's not bad there either. Ned is good and has had some great games, as well as a handful of total stinkers, but is our big game defender. I like Lynch but I think he's been exposed by his relative lack of pace, I watched him really get turned over by Bogle, who is so raw, but very physical for example. I'd keep them and add an extra CB while getting rid of Caulker, whom I like, but I think he needs a fresh start, where he can get his personal life in order. 

**LB** - Bidwell/Hamalainen/Robinson - Another position where I think we're set, having a good mix of experience and youth. I think Bidwell has proven he's a capable player at this level and doesn't usually make mistakes. I also like Robinson, but he has had a torrid time with injuries, which is a shame. I like Hamalainen, seems quick and unafraid to push up, had a very good cameo at Fulham in October.  

**MF** - Freeman/Luongo/Manning/Cousins/Goss/Doughty/Borysuik/Henry - I think Freeman has been a revelation. His quick feet are a joy to watch and he's been one of the players who seems to keep driving forward and is incredibly tricky to defend at this level. He should be the star of the team really. Luongo is a player I admire, he's had a lot of shit to deal with in his short time at QPR, but a battling midfielder and our best ball winner on his day. Excited to see him develop more and with some consistency in selection can become a key cog next to Freeman. Manning has also been a huge revelation this season, young, exciting and technically very good. I hope to see him being a regular starter unless he does get shifted to the Prem, in which case I wish him well. Though I do think another season or two here would be critical for his development. I am also a huge fan of Cousins, who had a raw deal being shunted out wide to accommodate others during JFHs tenure. I think we'll see a lot more from him, I watched a fair amount of him when he was at Charlton, as one of my mates is a fan, and I think he is another player who could be big for us, he has the engine, works hard, is young and has some crackers in him. I've seen very little from Goss, I think he's a project, needs to toughen up to stick in this league, but happy with the purchase, should have resale value in the future if he can live up to his potential. Doughty could be a defensive sub, who does lots of running and tackling - if Ollie ever considered it! I don't think he's got it in him to compete at this level, but I could be wrong. Borysuik I would like to see more of, although it seems like Ollie does not like him. Henry needs to leave, was useful a while ago, but limited and past it. 

**FW/ST** - Washington/Smith/Sylla/Petrasso/Mackie/Wszolek/Yeni/Shodipo/LuaLua (loan)/JET - We have an interesting mix of forward and wingers here. I would like to see Washington keep getting starts, no idea why he was benched when he was hot. I think he's finally finding his feet at this level and a season where he plays as the out and out striker will be great. Such a quick and tricky player. I would like to see Smith be used to knock down balls for Conor, not as the main plan, as it is ugly. Limited player, but hard working and could be useful for us. Sylla, is an interesting player. Inconsistent, but on his day his combination of speed and size make him dangerous. Very good rotation option and I think the highest scoring bench player in the league this season. Petrasso has shown glimpses over the past few seasons, needs a run of games to see what he has like Manning got really, not 35 minutes as a wing back. Mackie is a fan favourite and has shown he still has it in patches, like when we played Reading away, would keep him around (as we have already offered a contract).Wszolek is my signing of the season, technically a great player, a bit slow, but got to show what he can do and really happy with the signing. Scored some nice goals too! Yeni has finally found his feet after a rough start, with his dad passing and Ollie calling him fat... (terrible man management) and am excited to see what he can do now he knows his role and the English game. LuaLua has shown some flashes, might be worth signing him as I can't see Brighton needing him. Shodipo shouldn't have been loaned out, in my opinion, one of our best wingers, the kid puts in 100% and was a bright spark in a season of shite. Did well at Port Vale apparently. I think it's time to put the JET experiment to bed, hugely talented, but not a great attitude. I would like to see more of Morrison, but I don't know how that's going to play out. 

**Loans to come back** - Comley, Osman Kakay, Ben Gladwin, El Khayati - Don't know a lot about the youngsters, but could still come good, I would like to see Gladwin get another chance, but that's me and El Khayati should probably move on - JFH's man. There are a couple of other youngsters who I have no idea about. 


**OUT** - Caulker, Henry, Perch (maybe), Doughty, JET, El Khayati, Smithies (might be poached by Prem club).

**IN** - Backup CB, maybe sign LuaLua on a permanent, backup RB

I wouldn't tinker lots if we have consistent lineups we could be mid table, but I don't know if Ollie will do that. I am also a little fearful of what might happen in the transfer market after his comments in the last week or two. I don't think the club can go crazy spending wise yet, with FFP still not being resolved, but I would like to see us make a modest profit like last season if possible or get rid of Caulker's wages. It really depends on what the board decides the target is! But those are my two cents on the teams and players.",1212,2017-05-11

superhoops,"I think this passage is excellent

> The fact is if you want a good, proven, ‘name’, British striker in the Championship at the moment you have to pay more than QPR can afford. Villa and Newcastle have inflated that to absolutely ludicrous levels and Derby paid nearly £10m for Vydra who scored five times. If Holloway and/or supporters think Sylla isn’t good enough and needs to be replaced with a proven Championship striker they’re dreaming – we can’t afford one. The other fact is, whether his English is good enough to understand the wisdom Holloway and Bircham want to impart onto him or not, the £1m bargain bucket African we picked up from Anderlecht has outscored almost all of the players other clubs paid astronomical money for. He accomplished that in a poor team, which provides its strikers with shit service, in his first year in the country, in his first year of Championship football, while being bounced in and out of the team, and while having his manager publicly slagging him off.

He may turn out to be shit but QPR’s finances are forcing them to look for transfers like this more often whether we like it or not and so far he’s been a success story. He deserves far more respect than he’s getting at the moment in my opinion.

superhoops,"Tl;dr:

Possible reasons which can delay the process:

-Discussing the transfer fee

-Discussing player's personal terms

-Discussing agent fees

-The agent/player discussing all above three with multiple clubs at the same time to get the best deal

-The selling club wanting to record the selling profit to the next fiscal year

-The wanted player is on a holiday

-Work permits

-Registering the player to the squad

And just adding to this, many clubs announce the signing the second they reach an agreement on transfer fee and personal terms (or only transfer fee), while we, according to Lee Hoos in those finance-videos, announce the new player when absolutely every bit of deals, permits and medicals are done. So even if we were progressing with transfers, we wouldn't know about it until the player is practically ready to play in a league match.

I'd like to know your opinions on which seat to book, as I'm looking to buy a seat somewhere from the central area of the stands for the best possible view. There are free seats in pretty much every area except the middle of the South Africa Road(C, D and E-blocks + the special areas). The seat pricing isn't an issue since it's probably going to be another year or two until my next visit. Are there any differences between the two main stands and are for example the lower tier South Africa road seats ones to coincider?

Also, to which side of the stadium does the home team bus arrive if I happen to be around early? (a signed matchday programme would make a really nice souvenir)

And finally, please don't kill me, but my friends would want to go to watch the Tottenham-Juve friendly after the QPR-game, are there any hacks to avoid the jam in the undergrounds (less used undergroud stations for example) after the game to get to Wembley as quickly as possible from Loftus Road?

superhoops,Well we didn't lose 😏😎,5,2017-07-22
superhoops,"Some takeaways from that loss.  Smith's height is going to be vital for us this season.  He'll need to be getting crosses from the left and right.  Except... our only natural left wingers are El Khayati and Shodipo, who seem to be frozen out of the team.  Playing Washington out wide is a square peg in a round hole.  If we truly wanted we could stick Freeman out on the left.  He is a left-footed player and combined with Smith in their Bristol City days for a number of goals.  If we did stick Freeman out on the left we certainly have the depth in midfield to support that decision.  Centre of the pitch we have tons of options with Freeman, Luongo, Manning, and Goss potentially playing into the fold.  Good holding midfielders in Borsyiuk and Scowen.  On the right wing we have Wszolek, N'Gbakoto and Mackie (too bad they all play on the right).  In defense, we need to sell Caulker (or give him away) and play Furlong ahead of Perch.

Ideally we just need to fit round pegs into round holes.  Play players in their natural positions and we'll be alright.",193,2017-07-22

I think if Ollie can actually keep a settles side then we have a squad with some decent players in it, My main hope for the season if we can see players like Furlong, Manning and Washington improve with regular game time and maybe a few more players from our academy can break through to the first team. Definitely think we need a new right back to replace perch and an upgrade at centre back. ",135,2017-08-03
superhoops,"It's looking a little bleak at face value for me. Drawing conclusions before the season has even kicked off is a little short-sighted, admittedly, although I can't deny our lack of transfer activity is alarming.

I don't buy that the players returning from loans etc are ""like new signings"" and I'm expecting another long, long, slog of a season.

I believe in Ollie and think if we give him time we'll produce some good stuff, but then again, I would say that we are as close to relegation fodder this season as we've been since we came back down to the Championship.

How is everyone else feeling?",107,2017-08-03
superhoops,"I'm somewhat indifferent. I've been thinking around 13th to 18th which would be fine.  I'm really worried about where the goals will come from.  Matt Smith isn't much of a goal threat.  Sylla, when i've watched him is inconsistent but he bagged 10? Washington had 7 but hes inconsistent as well.  We're a little thin up front.

Our midfield is good and I like our wingers (Freeman can play there, pavel and yeni are exciting too). I wonder of shodipo will get another run out along with petrasso maybe?  We have hard workers in that area

Our defense needs to sort it out.  Im hoping to see more furlong instead of Perch as the latter is on the last year of his deal and will probably be leaving after that.  Im backing bidwell and lynch to have a much better season.",141,2017-08-03
superhoops,"I'm optimistic.  Remember, last time this year we were still trying to offload Sandro.  Think about that.  For the last two years we've been trying to offload players from our failed Premier League days.

We have a team now, we have no costly outcasts (Caulker might be costly but not an outcast).  We can actually build on what we have right now.  If the board can give Holloway some time we can build some consistency and chemistry within this group of players.

We might be missing some depth in a few areas but we also have some quality players.  A large FFP fine looms in the distance which is a destabilizing factor.  We are not going to be challenging for promotion this year but I believe we have something we can build on.",133,2017-08-03
superhoops,"I have tried not to jump to any conclusions based on pre-season friendlies in which the first team players are mixed with youngsters therefore not providing any real info on how the first team will do. In the Bournemouth game we played a team at least really close to our starting XI and I thought we looked okay.

Overall, I'm still quite neutral about our team, I think there are good players, especially in our midfield, who can make the difference on their day. 

I think the primary objective for this season should be reducing the amount of goals we let in. Last season we scored 52 goals but let in 66, if the goal amount remains the same but we manage to pinch for example 15 off the goals against, in the right matches, we should be looking for a comfortable mid table finish. As an example Derby scored 54, two more than us, last season but let in 16 goals less (50) and finished 9th.",167,2017-08-03

I can't fault Baptiste much but he's slow, and playing him next to attacking defenders was always a bad idea. I know Holloway is being charitable but Caulker was woeful and rightly deserved to come off, can't see him playing again for a while. The only positives from that game were 1) the young lad Chair who really tried to prove he deserved to be in the team and had some excellent runs and enthusiasm and 2) Freeman when he came on, different class of player, but whenever he makes a mistake it always lead to a good chance for Brentford.

I thought the matchday was really well organized with clear signs so finding the right places was really easy. If I had needed to ask anything there were a lot of personnel walking around the outside of the stadium.

I sat at the Ellerslie Road stand block V, on the right hand side of the block looking in the Ticketmaster site, so I was pretty much sat where the halfway line is drawn (on the Ticketmaster site the blocks are placed a bit wrongly, the halfway line should be in between the V and T blocks). I really liked the seat, great view, no pillars or anything on the way, there are also a lot people around you so there was quite a noise when Washington scored his first of the day. I sat on the row K, the 11th(?) row from the ground, so you got a good view from above but thanks to the quite steep stands I was still really close to the pitch. But as said, if you go for purely the atmosphere, R block is the place to be!

Also, take some cash with you if you want to buy food or drinks at the stadium, there were apparently limited card readers and at least the one I bought my drinks from didn't have one at all.

Sylla is arguably a better finisher than Matt Smith but offers little else.  He's scored 4 goals in 10 appearances (4 of those are starts) which is a good return but can't hold up play like Smith can and often goes missing for most of the game.

Smith is much better in the air but is so immobile that starting him means we are resigned to playing a direct style of play for the entirety he is on.  He has 4 goals in 11 but 9 of those are off the bench.

All three made it very clear that we are not going to spend millions on a striker, and we have to work with what we have unless a real bargain/free transfer comes up. Overall we are not going to buy new players unless we can get rid of some first.

Quite interestingly all three basically said that we are going to be a ""selling club"" until we cement a place in the premier league.

Is Ollie the man to take us back to the Premier League? Probably not with the current record.

But IMO he is the correct manager to start building a healthy foundation for a sustainable club with young and hungry players that actually want to be here. A foundation that can be used (hopefully sooner rather than later) by Ollie or the following managers to start finishing at the right end of the table on a consistent basis and perhaps one season resulting in a return to the Premier League with a well run club that can stay there for more than a season or two.

>Shipping out players on big contracts is difficult, but less so once they are in the final months of those deals. From the perspective of both sides, an agreement then becomes more straightforward because virtually any financial deal cut in order for the player to go would represent a saving compared to paying his full wages for the remainder of the season.

Maybe the same would apply to Onuoha as his big money contract is up in the summer too though the club will be leery of letting him go I'd imagine.",128,2017-12-12

Shodipo (0 mins)

Goss (0 mins)

Also, any additional players we should get rid of in your opinion?",127,2017-12-13
superhoops,"I'll go first.

Regarding the youngsters (Petrasso, Lumley, Dieng, RGC, Kakay, Goss), haven't really seen enough (or at all) of them to decide what their fate should be. Shodipo was a good player for us when he played last season and I've been suprised he hasn't featured at all this season. If he is not getting minutes here then possibly a loan deal? Same goes for Goss. Worked magic for Eze.

From the more senior players, definitely get rid of JET, no point keeping him around. Borysiuk already went on loan once and still hasn't got a place in first team after his return, so I'd imagine he'll be on his way as well. Same thing for Yeni if we aren't going to play with wingers, sadly for him because I though he played okay last season in his correct position. Next, Caulker. Got through to play a few matches but then suddenly found himself playing for the U21 team again? Got to be quite high paid as well, no use for him IMO if he can't keep himself in a condition to play regularly.

Out of the players playing quite regularly, regarding Onuoha and Perch it really depends on what sort of wages they are on atm. Perch is okay and gets the job done but by no means should be near to the highest paid players on the squad. Onuoha is in my opinion a solid defender with loads of experience, which our relatively young squad really needs. Renew IMO, unless the wages are too much. Mackie is in the same boat with these two, good to have as a backup with reasonable wages but sadly may be past his prime years.

Do I need to speak about Robinson? Tie him down as quickly as you can, one of the best players in the squad this season IMO.

Tl;Dr: 

LOAN: Shodipo, Goss

OUT: JET, Borysiuk, Ngbakoto, Caulker.

DEPENDS ON CONTRACT: Onuoha, Perch, Mackie

Our team didn’t have much talent but we had a set system and hard workers like Derry, mackie, Hill and so forth. String of goals from Djibril Cisse also helped. The next season Hughes brought in a lot of players on high wages who were really mercenaries. This alienated the players that qpr came up with and the team never played well. Didn’t get a win until late December. We came back up through the playoffs with guys like Austin, Fer, and Phillips. This was a good team, Austin being a class above scoring 18 goals I think. Our defense was old and leaky, Richard dune being one of our best players does not bode well. We conceded 73 goals that year. 

That’s the long answer. In short, our owner’s inexperience, terrible transfers and incompetence from Hughes and Redknapp (the latter buying players for a 3-5-2 and then abandoning the formation after a game) and mercenary players is why Qpr never performed well in the premier league.",187,2018-01-01

superhoops,"Okay

1st spell - Hughes bought a bunch of older players who'd already achieved loads and saw QPR as one last payday, only came cause we were paying big wages and many couldn't give a toss about our club. This formed a rift with the older non mercenary players in our team (Hill, Derry, Mackie etc)

2nd spell - Poor recruitment from Redknapp left a very unbalanced squad. He bought to play this 3 at the back formation with wing backs but dropped it after a couple of games which meant our squad didn't suit playing 4-4-2 (Isla, Fer and Vargas didn't fit that system). Hill and Austin papered over a lot of cracks that season. ",116,2018-01-01
superhoops,"I think everyone will have their own opinion but for me, it was that Tony Fernandes, the then CEO, was so green. Most of his decisions were daft and his public pronouncements were counter-productive. In fairness, he inherited a haphazard setup but he took a long time to steady the ship, which I think has happened now.

I'm not sure what was worse - the Mark Hughes/Kia Joorabchian reign or Harry Redknapp's. But either way, Fernandes gave them a blank checkbook to sign dross and took no action despite there being zero spirit in the camp and rank football on show.

Things are much better now with Crazy Ollie, Evil Les and the Tottenham mafia, and Chris 'Scrooge' Hoos. For real though - there's a feeling that the ship has steadied, albeit at the lower reaches of the championship and much of that I think stems from Tony stepping back and letting people who know what they're doing hold the reigns.

superhoops,"Including Caulker, [we got rid of nine players, and shipped an additional three out on loan](https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/comprehensive-list-qprs-january-transfer-14231814).  This brings our squad size down to 28, just 2 over the league average of ~26.

We brought in no one.  I think FFP has had a drastic effect on our dealings this transfer window.

We really needed a striker, but I guess that depends on what the goals for the club are this year.  At this point, it really looks like a rebuilding year with an emphasis on not getting relegated.  This means we will probably have to endure some difficult to watch football, with a more optimistic outlook hopefully coming next season.

I'm somewhat worried we didn't offload or re-sign Onuoha, as letting him go on a free at the end of the season would be a waste.  The same goes for Robinson, who has been one of the most improved players this season, signing him on a three-year deal should be an absolute priority.",163,2018-01-31

So I'm in London this weekend and am very excited to see QPR face Nottingham at Loftus Road! First time watching English club football live, I've been to all internationals my country has played against yours so I'm familiar with Wembley etc. Very excited for this Saturday!

My question, as a visiting football fan from a much smaller European league, would be which stand to choose for the best atmosphere? 

Also, I'm guessing drinking is forbidden in the stadium, so are there any nice pubs around where I can grab a pint close(ish) to the pitch? If you spot a guy awkwardly chanting along, be sure to give me a shout :)

Bidwell Robinson Nedum Furlong

Freeman Scowen Luongo

Washington Sylla Smyth

My differences come from I like the way Freeman roams around the field and is able to facilitate and play make,  Putting him at a winger role relegates him to one side.  I like Washingtons running ability, don't know if Eze can handle a full game (didn't look too effective against burton when he started).  Smith or Sylla was tough because Smith is such a problem for the opposition but Sylla can actually finish which is what we've been lacking.",91,2018-03-09
superhoops,"https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/5aa390498dd5dd25d4d2e441

I would play Freeman in the midfield three as the midfield balance with him, Scowen and Luongo is very good. Wheeler is more comfortable playing LW than Washington. Sylla is better in games where the opposition have big centre backs such as Bristol City and would rotate with Smith. Robinson, Hall and Onuoha would also all be fine options at centre back and I have no preference between the three. Perch could also rotate with Furlong, and Eze could be good from the bench or when Freeman is not playing.",91,2018-03-09

superhoops,"I'll go first:

https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/5aa2f0108dd5dd25d4d2e3cd

Selections + reasons:

**Smithies:** No real reasons needed here

**Bidwell:** IMO a really solid LB, not a good wingback. If Robbo plays CB, no real competition for this position.

**Robinson:** One of our best players this season, maybe switch to Lynch when opposing to a side with big and tall forwards. Also suprisingly good at CB despite only being introduced to the position this season.

**Onuoha:** Despite all the stick he gets he's arguably our best defender. Brings experience to the otherwise relatively young backline and the team in whole.

**Furlong:** Only real competition is Perch, brings some threat going forward as well. Maybe switch to Perch when some stability is needed with the cost of some pace.

**Luongo:** Picks himself.

**Scowen:** Picks himself.

**Eze:** Just looks better and better every time I watch him play. A really exciting prospect who needs gametime and brings some unpredictability to the side along with Smyth. Don't know if he's familiar with playing on the wing so positioned him as a part of the middle three. Switch positions with Freeman when necessary.

**Freeman:** Picks himself, switch with Eze when necessary. Winger position make sense since he has the ability and skill to run at defenders and he's arguably one of the best crossers and passers in the league.

**Sylla:** A really tough choice between him and Conor. The striker position overall is the one I don't really have a solid pick for. Really depends on the opposition and if we are going to press hard and counter (Washington, maybe Sylla, some doubt on the pressing for him) or just depend on crosses to the big man Smith. Ollie should really be careful with when to start Matt because when doing that he loses one of our biggest assets from the bench. Also with Smith up front we always end up hoofing the ball more than I'd like so I'd certainly keep the starting striker selection mostly between Conor and Idrissa.

**Smyth:** A real prospect along with Eze. Got past Derby's experienced defence over and over again and created really good chances with some lovely turns and backheels. Like Eze brings some unpredictability and flair to the side. Only real current competition is Pav, who sadly hasn't reached last season's levels this season, which may well be because of the wingback position.",392,2018-03-09

superhoops,"I already posted about some advice regarding the WBA away match 18.8, but now me and my friends decided to extend our stay to wednesday so that I could see our home match against Bristol City as well!

Which leads to my actual questions: As my friend who is primarily a CP fan wanted (quite suprisingly, probably wants to see some real football) to come to the Bristol City match with me, what is the best pub around LR for a pre-match pint? The Springbok aka Queens Tavern is the closest but are there any other good options? There is little room to sit at the Queens Tavern as much as I've seen which is something we'd appreciate since I'll probably drag him to the ground so early that I can get an autograph in my matchday programme. Also since we'd like to watch some PL on Sunday do you have any suggestions for good, tourist friendly pubs around London, perhaps in a nice location or something? Our hotel is located near Regents Park if that matters.

Also a bit off-topic but figured out this would probably be a good place to ask since there are probably many people with similiar interests here: As there are a few days without football in the friday-wednesday period, do you (especially londoners) have any suggestions for things to do in London for a band of four male football fans apart from watching football in a pub?

Sorry for a long post, tl;dr:

1. Good pubs near LR?
2. Things to do in London for four male football fans apart from football?

superhoops,"Just had some spare time and took the time to actually look up to some of the transfer business we've been doing since adding Penrice and co. to the scouting department:

We've now signed:

**Luke Freeman**, 12 assist 5 goals last season, need I say more?

**Josh Scowen**, all-round solid midfielder who was wanted by PL clubs but decided to join us

**Paul Smyth**, really exciting prospect and a full Northern Ireland international at the age of 20

**Bright Osayi-Samuel**, another exciting prospect who was part of winning promotion to L1 with Blackpool

**Toni Leistner**, statistically one of the best defenders you can find in 2. Bundesliga, wanted by Norwich, Villa and Fulham but decided to join us.

All five for a combined sum of 549k £ (no official fees, used the reported approx fees from [transfermarkt.co.uk](https://transfermarkt.co.uk))

I think we should really appreciate the work being done by our scouting staff, somehow the FFP has led us to signing bargains I really struggle to think we'd have found if there was no 40 million pound fine hanging above our heads.",180,2018-07-13

I mean we've got a solid squad apart from a striker and maybe the defence still needs some experience, but if McClaren can get the young guns firing then I think we might do really well. Eze, BOS and Smyth just seemed to get better and better the more they played last season.

Rationally thinking, with our spending and restrictions I'm relatively pleased as long as we improve from last season.",113,2018-07-18
superhoops,"Hey! Don't usually post but I'm bored at work xD 

Judging from McClaren's previous roles, this upcoming season could either be a real success or end up like last season: lower-mid table. The good thing is that apparently he's very good at man-management (especially with youngsters) and when he was a coach with us last time round we were very successful.

Depending on the formation obviously, I think our midfield is sorted, and Eze seems to be an exciting prospect as a second striker or something similar. Hope Matt Smith starts more up front as he's good at what he does. Feel sorry for Connor Washington as he's been really poor in general since he joined (not for the want of trying!), but maybe this will be his season.

We need more defenders definitely. We missed Hall a lot last season, but we need more faces in that department in general. We'll see what happens! Let's try to be optimistic :D ",161,2018-07-18

Bright caused all sorts of trouble to their backline as he came on and had a good final 20 minutes. A really positive display overall IMO, we could beat many Championship sides playing like that.

I just wanted to ask a few quick questions as I’m writing an article about the upcoming Championship season. They are regarding your set-piece takers…

1. Who takes your penalties?
2. Who takes your direct free kicks?
3. Who takes your corners and indirect free kicks?

Would be really grateful if some of you could let me know that information (I’ve searched online, but it’s not too readily available).

Many thanks and good luck this season!",79,2018-07-26
superhoops,"Based on last season... 
1. We'd have to get some penalties first! Connor Washington and Jake Bidwell took one each last season, the latter missing. I'd imagine that Washington will remain the first choice this season, despite probably not being in the starting 11. 
2. Direct free kicks are usually taken by either Josh Scowen or Luke Freeman. 
3. Indirect free kicks and corners are usually taken by Luke Freeman. 

Hope this helps and if anyone else sees this feel free to correct me!

Since we have never been before we are looking for some advice on seating/time to get there/bars to drink at before match.  Thanks in advance

superhoops,McClaren hints some players are finished at QPR after cup debacle,11,2018-09-26
superhoops,"Sure, the performance on the pitch wasn't what we wanted it to be and some of that responsibility lies on the players.  SMc must be quite conceited though if he thinks none of the blame is his.  Smith was isolated up front and we couldn't get our wingers into the game.  Tactics come into play at one level or another, and that blame falls squarely on the manager.",68,2018-09-26
superhoops,"You are bang on with your point about our formation.  Playing Freeman and Eze as wingers is perfectly analogous to ""square peg, round hole"".  Due to this they are being severely underutilized.  Unfortunately they share the same preferred position, which means we could only play one of them at a time.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  This ""square peg, round hole"" situation we find ourselves in has knock-on effects across the whole team, specifically for Hemed and Wells.  We need to deploy some proper wingers, BOS, Smyth, Wszolek, move Freeman back to his preferred position, and move Eze to the bench.

More worryingly though is that several players seem to have regressed following Holloway's departure.  Wszolek, Scowen, Smyth, Freeman, just to name a few.  The togetherness of the squad overall just seems to have unravelled somewhat under SMc.  Maybe this can be addressed by getting back to winnings ways.",151,2018-10-01
superhoops,"So in the light of the loss to Swansea, I don't like the use of the current 4-4-2 with Eze and Freeman on the wings; this is a tricky one as we aren't having a fantastic season and some of our ""best"" players are being played out of position. I have tried to look at how a couple of our best creative outlets have been playing and how we could slot them in better.

**Ebere Eze:**    
He has looked great when played in a number 10 role when in behind a striker (Nakhi Wells or Tomer Hemed) but he's been put on the right wing a lot which has left our right back exposed in a 4-4-2. Often drifts inside with Freeman doing the same on the left which makes us look like a 4-2-2-2 and vulnerable on the counter. That said, he's a young player who has recently gotten a full run of games so he has a lot to learn.

**Nakhi Wells and Tomer Hemed**    
Really have made a difference for us, although they haven't been banging them in they have been putting other players into dangerous positions. With a little bit more luck things could have gone our way a little more recently. 

**Luke Freeman**    
He has looked OK, but definitely not at his best of late in my opinion. Often runs into dead ends and the final ball isn't always great, although his through balls with Wells' pace have been very good and they have looked dangerous playing off of one another.

**General Tactics**

I think tactically we struggle in a 4-4-2, square pegs round holes type of deal, Luongo has been having a *very* poor season in central midfield (has not had a single good game recently imo) and paired up with Geoff Cameron there is no real creativity in the centre of midfield.

I think a change in formation may do us some good, a 4-1-2-1-2 would allow Cameron (or Scowen) to drop in to the defensive line making it easier for the right and left backs to close down the wide areas. It would also put Eze in behind the 2 strikers where he thrives. The midfield 2 would be Freeman and Luongo with Freeman playing the ball to either the strikers or Eze in the hole. Wells has shown a really incredible workrate in getting back from what I have seen, so if he is dropping deep to get the ball then we still have Hemed as a long ball option and Eze to start a counter attack higher up the pitch, thus:

-------------Lumley---------------      
Rangel--Lynch--Leistner--Bidwell     
-------------Cameron--------------     
--Luongo--------------Freeman--    
----------------Eze----------------     
-------Hemed------Wells---------


The other option would be to play a 4-4-2 but with an out an out winger on the right (Pawel Wszolek or Bright Osayi-Samuel) and Eze in behind the striker up top. Either way, the experimentation couldn't really hurt as the current 4-4-2 system with both Hemed and Wells hasn't been getting goals for either of them (1 goal in 6 games between them). I feel like this addresses our lack of creativity in midfield - Eze can drop a bit deeper and look for through balls to Freeman and Wszolek, thus:

----------------Lumley---------------      
Rangel---Lynch---Leistner---Bidwell     
Wszolek--Luongo--Cameron--Freeman    
------------------Eze-------------------      
-----------------Wells---------------

",534,2018-10-01
superhoops,"I think Lukey's not even been that bad on the wing and he's really good at tracking back but just looking at the numbers he got for assists from the middle last season really suggests that a central position is by far his strongest.

I think Eze's more out of position on the wing than Luke even though he can run at defenders, he's at his best when he's on the ball a lot much like Freeman which neither really achieve at the wing.

If Steve insists on playing both at the same time then Luke's the one to play on the wing with Eze in the middle, much like a 4-2-3-1 with Wells or Hemed up top depending on the opposition. I'd really love to see BOS given a go in the league, he was playing really well at the end of last season and in the cup this season so I find it quite strange that Steve's not given him more minutes in the league. He'd really improve our counter-attack threat as well. ",175,2018-10-01

superhoops,David Wheeler thinks QPR are unhappy with lack of game time at Pompey,13,2018-11-13
superhoops,"Pompey fan here - if Wheeler is only really able to get into our team for Checkatrade games and the dying moments of an FA Cup game against a non league team, how is he ever going to get into your team?

Tbf he looks like a decent League One player, but he's not as good as either of our first choice wingers, could probably get into any league one 11 other than ours, Sunderlands, Barnsley's and maybe Peterboroughs. 

&#x200B;

My question is do QPR give a shit if he doesn't play because he's 28 and not really in the first team plans, I would understand Villa being annoyed Andre Green isn't playing because he's 19 and a prospect for them, but Wheeler seems to me more of a loan to get his wages off the books when he isn't needed, there's no risk of him being recalled right?",149,2018-11-13

So far at least Villa, Millwall and Norwich at home have been on tv, but fortunately for some reason the QPR matches tend to be picked more by the overseas broadcasters (BeIn in Australia if I'm not completely mistaken) which you'll be able to watch in a pub or such.

But yeah if you want to get involved in the singing business then the R-block is definitely the place to be, personally I'll probably try out the R-block or the R-block side of the loft next time I fly over since I'm getting more familiar with the chants.

[QPR Financial Review](http://financialfootballnews.com/qpr-2018-financial-review-ffp-hits/) 
",14,2019-02-19
superhoops,"Joel Lynch - Not good enough for QPR and never has been. Played his best football when he had Cameron sitting in front of him, aside from that awful. Makes a mistake every game, costs us points.  


Jake Bidwell - Overated. Consistently average is the best compliment i'll give him. Offers nothing but a good cross every now and then going forward, doesnt offer anything defensively. Not good enough.  


Midfield - Mass, Cousins and Scowen are all decent championship midfielders individually but we massively lack an experienced head in the middle of the park. Unsuprising that our best run of form this season was when we had Cameron sitting in front of the back 4. Strong, great interceptions, experienced, can pick a pass.  


Lumley and Eze - Fans expecting too much too soon. Lumley a great prospect, fantastic shot stopper but needs to work on distribution and aerial ability. Eze fantastic on the ball, has the ability to glide past players and create space but needs to work on defensive discipline - he's only 20 years old. Give these 2 a break!  


Matt Smith - Undeniably great in the air and a good asset to have in the squad. For me you just cant start him, we are a much better side when we get the ball down and play football. Its a shame as he's got goals in him, it just becomes very predictable and cant be done week in week out.  


Wells and Hemed - We have 2 proven championship strikers in our squad, play them both while we can! Admittedly Hemed has been injured, but was initially dropped to accomodate Eze. They've both got goals in them, why not play them together while we have can? I honestly dont know what the plan is for next season but its worrying times with Matt Smith looking like our only striker next season.  


Pawel - Not a wing-back, hes a right winger. He causes every team problems running down the right flank when hes sat higher up. Got a good cross on him and the odd goal. Tracks back well and helps out his full-back but hes not a wing-back. Playing him in that role massively holds him back and you can see his frustration. ",376,2019-02-19
superhoops,"Agree 100% on Lynch, we are miles better with Hall at the back.  Bidwell is probably having his best season with us, and has become an improved player over the years.  I think a more accurate description of him would be reliable and consistent - which is exactly what we need at the back.  Now, would Robinson have taken his place if he had stayed? Most likely.  Is he the weak leak in the defense right now? Absolutely not.  We have to sort out the center back situation as it has been our Achilles heel over the years.  The last time we weren't consistently shipping goals was when Dunne was in the squad.

I put Scowen in the same boat as Lynch, he had one good season under Holloway and now regularly sprays misplaced passes across the pitch.  Cousins has been an injury prone let down since he came to the club.  Interestingly, he has probably shown his best form in the last few games and, if he can keep it up, he could have a place in the squad yet.

I'm been pleasantly surprised by Lumley, especially after the two massive saves he made today, but you are spot on in your overall assessment of both him and Eze.

Remember earlier in the season when we were playing Wells and Hemed, but we were still losing.  Maybe it could work again but we have tried it and it didn't work.  I think we can all agree that Smith is a limited footballer but I'm willing to give him a few more games paired up with either Wells or Hemed.

Cameron and Rangel were the catalyst behind our ascendancy towards the top-half of the table before Christmas.  We have struggled since they went out injured.  However, with the exception of Sheffield we have been missing out on points by slim margins and against good teams.  We cannot underplay the effect the transfer embargo and lack of a budget has had on our ability to strengthen the squad in any way.",340,2019-02-19

superhoops,"So as you can tell from this post I have a quiet week and I noticed that we don't currently have a banner image for this sub. If it's okay for u/peetss I'd like to at least try to create one. I figured I'd ask here if you can think of any nice pictures of emotional/important moments for our club you'd like to see featured. I was thinking of something like in the linked picture, with probably 4-6 pictures like the 1967 cup win photo already included in the banner. The background is still also undecided, I'll probably try to see how it'd look if every picture was inside a vertical blue and white hoop. Also any other ideas are welcome! Feel free to link (preferrably high quality versions) of the pictures you may find!

&amp;#x200B;

Just bare in mind that the included banner is just a early edit and nothing is decided as of yet!

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:

Alternative designs added, no hoops or yes hoops? If I wanted the no hoops option would allow me to fit a couple more photos if necessary since the pictures wouldn't need to be so far apart from each other.

I'll probably do some actual work now and will probably finish by tomorrow so please suggest any photos :)

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE #2:

Added a version of just a picture of Loftus Road in the background, it's quite hard to make a entire picture look nice on the banner since the banner is so thin.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE #3:

Added a possible final version of the no hoops-option which turned out pretty well in my opinion. If there are any changes you'd like it's not hard at all to e.g. swap pictures etc. Hope you like it, and also Peetss if you try to add that banner please tell me if it doesn't fit properly!

Yes, I agree that he’d get a lot of patience from the fans. Certainly more than a few of the names listed in the original post.

There’s such a mix of expectation from both the fans and the owners. I was listening to Luke Freeman talk on the Loftcast about how it’s the games were the R’s are expected to win that are the most difficult. I think there needs to be a collective conscious instilled in the fans and the board that we are now a club that’s far from the heights of the Premiership - I think that will only come about with a manager who has been given time, I just hope they appoint a good one.

superhoops,"Appointing Sherwood would be disastrous - we simply do not have the financial resources to fund his managerial philosophy, and I don’t believe he would be able to inspire the belief that is desperately required within the players to avoid relegation.

Brining in Ainsworth could go either way. He has shown that he can bring out the best in younger players like Eze, who he had on loan at Wycombe. However, with this being such a tricky transitional period for the club, has he demonstrated the grit to keep us afloat? I’m not sure. We need a figure who will fire up the squad, someone to show them that they’ll need to scrap to survive. 

I personally would be pleased with the appointment of either Moore or Bowyer - the steady tactical approach Moore displayed during his time at West Brom would certainly be welcomed at QPR; more players need to be trusted with increasing responsibilities, we cannot continue to rely on our mainstays like Freeman - I feel like this would happen under Moore’s management. Bowyer on the other hand, although not as tactically sound in my opinion, has demonstrated during his time at Charlton that he is able to succeed with a small squad and limited finances.

The focus for the rest of the season must be to remain in the Championship - after that, some fundamental changes need to take place. I just hope the board makes a wise appointment now and gives whomever they choose the time to develop and execute their vision for the club. The fans could do with some good times in the R’s future.

 ",272,2019-04-02
superhoops,"While I don't know the exact manager we'll settle on, I think it will play out like this:

Freeman and Eze will go in the summer, hopefully we can get 10-15 million between them.  We can use that money to buy at least 4-5 players, which we will absolutely need.  Maybe we can buy Wells too.  We are not a club on the up, rather, we are trying to find financial stability by cutting every single non-essential cost.  We will likely not hire a manager who is used to big spending, but rather someone who has shown the ability to do lots with little (ex: Lee Bowyer).",107,2019-04-02

superhoops,"Im rarely an advocate of a manager losing their job - I think that people tend to overvalue the difference that a manager can make, and as such are quick to call for a change when one isn't always needed. That being said, having watched the game at home to Bolton on Saturday, I think it was about time for MacClaren to go. I had never before seen a team with as little tactical direction or want to play for the badge as on Saturday. It speaks volumes that the Bolton team beat us fairly comfortably, whilst also showing us exactly why they are relegation favourites, and this is before we consider the fact that they seemed to want it more despite not knowing when they'll next be paid! 

&amp;#x200B;

I never rated the appointment of MacClaren in the first place, I think that Holloway should have been given an extra season to help develop some of the youth players that he was working so well with before making way for a more modern, tactically astute manager. But that's neither here nor there - the fact of the matter is that we are now managerless, precariously close to relegation and with some of our key youth players low on confidence or loaned out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, the odds on favourite for the job is Tim Sherwood ([https://www.thesackrace.com/teams/queens-park-rangers](https://www.thesackrace.com/teams/queens-park-rangers)), but I don't think that the club could make a worse decision. Graduating from the Harry Redknapp school of football, his philosophy is to buy as many big name players as he can, with the hope that 11 of them might play well together, something that QPR simply cannot afford to do. Other favourites includeGareth Ainsworth, Mark Warburton and the recently sacked Darren Moore. Of these three, I'd quite like either to see either Darren Moore or Mark Warburton appointed. Ainsworth hasn't done enough tactically for me to believe he's capable of any upward motion and him coming back to QPR would realistically only tarnish his image at the club. Darren Moore was unjustly sacked by WBA, and although he's not exceeded expectations there, he will now a point to prove and it could work out quite well for us. Mark Warburton did a great job while at Brentford, and played the type of football that I would like to see at Loftus Road, not least because I believe that players like Freeman, Eze, Manning and Chair (when he returns) would play the better because of it.

Someone who is capable of scoring 20+ in the championship or League 1 if worse comes to worst. Liverpool and Spurs have a few strikers who are scoring ridiculous amounts of goals in youth football. A loan deal with the option to buy would be a brilliant piece of business.

Giles Phillips deserves a chance this season over lynch and Niko Hamalainen deserves a chance at left back. Ilias Chair should be given as much of an opportunity as Eze was last season and maybe Osayi-Samuel and Shodipo as wingers. 

Furthermore, with the impending departure of Freeman in the summer we need a midfielder capable of creating chances and scaring the opposition. As much as I’d love to see a return of Adel I doubt that would happen, so I’d say a Mason Greenwood/Angel Gomes type of top 6 club youth prospect would be a brilliant investment, even if they’re just on loan.

superhoops,"So, as our championship status is practically confirmed for the next season I thought I'd make a round-up on some matters such as the ever present talking point of our expiring contracts and offer some of my thoughts. Brace yourself, this might be long-ish.

**Outgoings**

Before I get to our expiring contracts I'd just like to make a point on our wage structure. A small detail that amazed me was when Millwall was interested in loaning Smith but staggeringly weren't able to afford his wages. Just let that sink in. Millwall, like it or not a club in very similar situation to us, can't afford to loan in our reserve striker. That made me wonder what are we paying to other players, especially those that we signed shortly after our relegation in 15/16 and 16/17 seasons? I'm completely fine with Luongo potentially being one of our high earners since he's a top player but the thought that Joel Lynch could well be the best paid defender in our books really makes you think.

That said, the **following players are out of contract this summer**:

(Loans of Wells, Cameron and Hemed end)

**Jake Bidwell**. A decent championship left back in my opinion, aged only 26. Transferred in from Brentford, where he was a regular starter. From a wage perspective, surely there must have been a financial factor in play to abandon a regular starter position just to switch to a rival club? Obviously not sure what we're actually paying him but from all the players out of contract I feel he might be the one with finances playing a big part in renewing.

**Joel Lynch**. Such a strange defender. One moment he's dancing ""take the L"" with Toni after popping in our second goal past Ipswich, the next he's making the same schoolboy errors again and again in our end resulting in conceding goals. Hate to say this but he's 31, which should be the age in which defenders are in their prime, and Joel's prime is not really convincing if I'm being honest. Probably on a expensive contract as well as he was signed during our first season back in the champ. Wouldn't renew.

**Grant Hall** and **Jordan Cousins**. Very similar players with a horrendous injury history but both with potential to be good championship players. Jordan only 25 years old, Grant 27. Tricky to say if we should or shouldn't renew. Again will depend on wages but honestly have no idea. Both have seemed like class players if they are anything like the short glimpses they've offered us so far but really can't blame the club if they don't renew either.

**Pawel Wszolek**. Transfermarkt says that we have a option for a further year in his contract, a very average winger in attacking sense with excellent workrate defensively which is definitely his strong point. Would renew unless a good alternative appears.

**Angel Rangel**. Stay. Please. If it's not for a playing role then I think we need a good seasoned pro who's been there and done that in the Premier League. If we renew Darnell's contract I'd imagine Angel would be really helpful for him with his experience.

**Darnell Furlong**. A decent enough young right back with a wealth of championship experience for his age. Can't imagine him being paid a fortune, would renew.

**Potential transfers out:**

I'd say our most sellable player would be (obviously) Freeman. A good player no doubt but I'd say we're out of options if a PL club comes calling with a decent bid and wages combination from both players and clubs point of view. Hard to tell who's actually good in this current form we're in. Doubt Eze will go anywhere in the summer after his dip in form.

I've been reading about Joe Lumley being linked with Bristol City. In my opinion he's a excellent player who's not being really talked about, especially as there seem to be not that many young English goalkeepers around in the Championship. Wouldn't sell, I think he's played a major part in our improved clean sheet amount even if he's been exposed to highly questionable defensive work at times.

Potential loans depend highly on players we manage to bring in so I'm not going to write about those.

**Potential transfers in:**

A striker. Probably almost a certainty we bring a striker in for next season. Can't see us relying on Oteh and Smith, with the former being really inexperienced to be the number one striker and the latter being rather one dimensional even if he's a good goalscorer. As any Championship strikers seem to be valued on a basis of 1m / 1 goal scored I don't think we'll be able to bring in anyone from the championship. I'd like to see us go for strikers outside the UK, also considering that championship clubs can offer decent wages compared to many other smaller European first tier leagues.

Defenders, based highly on whose contracts we renew. This is a area I'd like a good experienced championship centerback to play with Leistner. Also maybe slightly more attacking alternatives to fullback areas as especially Bidwell isn't excactly lightning fast.

We're definitely fine on the midfield area, can't see any movement there unless someone is sold.

Wingers, maybe? When the loan players return there is Smyth, Wszolek, BOS, Freeman, Shodipo (and Wheeler?). That's a decent amount, but might need to strengthen if Luke is sold.

If you took your time to read this far I salute you. Just needed to open up somewhere.",923,2019-04-19
superhoops,"Solid assessment.  I'd keep Hall for sure, and offload Cousins.  We'll probably need to bring in a CB/LB, a central midfielder and a striker for next season.",27,2019-04-19
superhoops,"I thought the club was slowly trying to sort out the wage structure, but after hearing what Wells, Hemed and Cameron might be on (all rumours admittedly) I really have no idea about the finances of the club.

Looking at the squad list on the website, these are the players that I reckon should leave:

**Ingram** Gotta go I think. Didn't cover himself in glory and might as well give his spot to a youngster. Hopefully can rejuvenate his career somewhere else.

**Lynch** If it means we can sign someone else, I'd like to see him go. Like you said, not reliable enough and could be on a big wage. If we don't have anyone on the horizon I guess we'd have to keep him though.

**Freeman** Our best player, but we need the cash to strengthen the team.

**Wheeler** Not much point keeping him unless we're going to play him. He's 28.

---
With the loanees also going, this would be our strongest team without signings:

Lumley, Rangel, Hall, Leistner, Bidwell, Wszolek, Luongo, Scowen, BOS, Eze, Smith

This a very weak side, and would probably get relegated. If Hall can get back to playing well that'll help us out, but this window we'll need at least a CB, LB (unless Manning can play there, discussed on Loft For Words) RM, CM, LM and ST. As well as a manager of course.

superhoops,"**Loans exiting**: Wells, Cameron, Hemed.  

**Analysis**: Wells would be the only player worth looking at signing permanently.  With a market value of £4.05m, is likely to be out of our league financially speaking.

**Players out of contract**: Bidwell, Lynch, Hall, Wszolek, Cousins, Rangel, Shodipo, Baptiste.

**Depth Chart**:

GK: Lumley, Ingram.

LB: (Bidwell), Manning.

CB: Leistner, (Hall), (Baptiste), (Lynch).

RB: Furlong, Kakay, (Rangel).

LM: Osayi-Samuel, Manning, (Shodipo).

CM: Luongo, Scowen, Goss, (Cousins).

RM: Smyth, (Wszolek).

AM: Freeman, Eze, Chair.

ST: Smith, Oteh, Smyth.

**Analysis**:

**Defense**: Left back has no cover and thus we should prioritize re-signing Bidwell.  He is reliable and rarely injured.  At centre back we also run into problems if we do not re-sign Hall and Baptiste.  Hall seems to be past his extensive knee problems and both have performed consistently well in recent years.  Not only that but Baptiste can provide cover anywhere across the back line.  Lynch should be let go.  Between his constant injury problems and lack of quality, he is simply not good enough.  It is worth considering retaining Rangel if the price is right.  He can provide good experience to Furlong but he is getting up there in age and there are questions around whether he can stay fit.  If we can keep Bidwell, Hall, and Baptiste we should still consider signing another CB/LB.

**Potential Signings (criteria being out of contract, under 30, likely improvement):** 

**LB:** Jonas Knudsen (Ipswich, Out of Contract), Martin Olsson (Swansea, Out of Contract), Joe Mattock (Rotherham, Out of Contract).

**CB:** Mike van der Hoorn (Swansea, Out of Contract), Yoann Barbet (Brentford, Out of Contract), Mark Beevers (Bolton, Out of Contract), Michael Ihiekwe (Rotherham, Out of Contract)

**Midfield**: Both wings seem in good hands, especially if we prioritize signing Wszolek with the option for another year on his contract.  We lack depth at central midfield.  Goss returns from his loan but there is little confidence he is worth a spot in the first team.  Cousins has been injury prone and also lacking in quality in his time with QPR and should be released.  We will likely need two new players to be confident in our depth at this position.  There is talk that Freeman could be sold off to a Premier League club next season and we could definitely use that transfer fee to finance the purchase of several players.  What is more is that even if Freeman was to go, we would still have plenty of depth at attacking midfield.

**Potential Signings CM:** Markus Henriksen (Hull, Out of Contract), Alan Browne (Preston, Out of Contract), Lewis Wing (Middlesbrough, Out of Contract), Lewis Macleod (Brentford, Out of Contract), 

**Striker**: If we do not sign Wells permanently, and it is very unlikely that we will, we will surely need to bring another striker into the team.  We should definitely work Oteh into the team off the bench, but as a team we still struggle to find a true striker since Austin left the team many years ago.

**Potential Signings ST (going over 30 years old here):** Fraizer Campbell (Hull, Out of Contract), David McGoldrick (Sheffield United, Out of Contract), Lee Gregory (Millwall, Out of Contract), Freddie Sears (Ipswich, Out of Contract).

Striker is likely the position where we might have to make use of a transfer fee.  I could also see us going to the loan market for another 1-2 players next season.",562,2019-04-25

Unfortunately our “fun” on twitter is to use emojis and have weird comments, using twitter like a parent uses Facebook. This makes us seem out of touch and unrelateable to younger fans. Especially with the game growing at the rate is in (at least in America) with the younger people (15+) getting more and more into the game, seeing this type of commentary on their feeds ruins the vibe they get. If we can have fun and even to make fun of ourselves (trust me that’s the humor and there’s plenty to make fun of anyway) we can get a social media following, which leads to new support, which leads to a growing and thriving club. A simple change like that can put QPR where we should be.",205,2019-07-02
superhoops,"I've decided to do a write up looking in to the current depth of positions and where I feel we can strengthen and who can come in to fill these gaps. In this specific write up I'm going to be looking at the position of Centre-backs.

&amp;#x200B;

# Current depth:

***Toni Leistner*** **(28)** \- Current captain at the club I feel Leistner's first season in English football was a partial success, standing at 6'3"" he was a decent threat in the air at corners, winning 4.2 aerials per game, this threat in the box was displayed in our home 0-0 draw with Reading where he hit the crossbar twice. From a defensive stand point Leistner was decent, winning 1.4 tackles and interceptions per game. However, where he excelled was in the clearance department where he made 6.7 clearances per game (5th in the league). Overall, Leistner looked a solid addition to the squad, and was proven to be our best defender in the squad.

&amp;#x200B;

***Yoann Barbet*** **(26)** \- New signing from rivals Brenford, Barbet looks to be a great coup on a free transfer due to his versatility and consistency at Centre half for Brentford over the last four years, where he made 107 appearances in the league. Barbet is up there with the best ball playing Centre-backs in the league, Barbet played 0.4 key passes per game season whereas Adam Webster played 0.5 per game. However, despite being  6'2"" he isn't as great in the air as you'd want in a Centre half, only winning 2.3 aerial duels per game.

&amp;#x200B;

***Grant Hall*** **(27)** \- Having struggled with a knee injury over the last two seasons Hall will be looking to come back into the first team this coming season. Hall seemed to be one of the best defenders at the club before his injury and he had some decent performances in the closing stages of last year including his composed performance against Watford in the 5th round of the FA cup. It will be interesting to see if Hall can return to full fitness and in turn become a key figure in the team again.

&amp;#x200B;

***Darnell Furlong*** **(23)** did feature at Centre-back last season but I still feel his best position is at Right Back.

Additionally one of our U23 players could fill in at Centre-back if need be, ***Giles Phillips*** **(22)** was on the bench when we lost 2-0 to Derby last season, whereas ***Charlie Rowan*** **(21)** and ***Ben Wells*** **(19)** have both came for respected Premier league academies in Watford and West Ham. However, I do still feel there is room for an additional Centre half and so I looked up some potential transfers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Free transfers:

***Michael Morrison*** **(31)** \- Leaving Birmingham where he was captain

* 107 Championship games in the last 3 years for Birmingham
* 7 goals scored, all from corners proving he is an aerial threat (4.2 aerial duels won per game)
* 1.3 Tackles, 1.2 Interceptions and 5 Clearances per game
* Only dribbled past 0.4 times per game
* Not the greatest passing with only 64% pass success per game
* If he was to sign we would need to pay wages around £7k-£10k per week

&amp;#x200B;

***Dominic Ball*** **(23)** \- Leaving Rotherham

* Played under Warburton at Rangers in the 15/16 season
* Had been on loan at Aberdeen for the last two seasons making 37 total league appearances

* However is particularly weak in the air only winning 1.8 aerial duels per game
* If we was to sign we would need to pay wages around £5k per week

&amp;#x200B;

***David Wheater*** **(32)** \- Leaving Bolton

* Large amount of Championship experience - 205 games in total and 66 in the last two seasons
* 1.3 Tackles, 1.6 Interceptions, 7.5 clearances per game (3rd most in league)
* Only dribbled past 0.4 times per game

* 1.4 Tackles, 2.2 Interceptions, 5.4 clearances per game
* Dribbled past at an average of 0.6 times per game
* Poor passing - 0.2 key passes and 69.8% pass success per game
* If he was to sign we would need to pay wages around £8k-£12k per week

&amp;#x200B;

# Players that would require a transfer fee:

***Aristote Nsiala*** **(27)** \- Ipswich

* 22 appearances last season as Ipswich got relegated
* 1.5 Tackles, 2.2 Interceptions, 5.4 clearances per game
* Only dribbled past an impressive 0.3 times per game
* Average passing - 0.1 key passes and 70.2% pass success per game
* 5 aerials won per game due to him being 6'4""
* Valued between £500k - £1.2m
* If he was to sign we would need to pay wages around £5k-£10k per week

&amp;#x200B;

***Derrick Williams*** **(26)** \- Blackburn

* 27 appearances last season
* 1.1 Tackles, 1.7 Interceptions, 3.4 clearances per game
* Only dribbled past an impressive 0.2 times per game
* Decent passing - 0.5 key passes and 69.9% pass success per game
* 3.9 aerials won per game despite being 5'11""
* Valued between £675k- £1.5m
* If he was to sign we would need to pay wages around £6k-£10k per week
* Looks to be quite a good ball playing Centre-back who would suit Warburton's passing game however, there is this mess: [https://twitter.com/SoccerAM/status/905018703917359104](https://twitter.com/SoccerAM/status/905018703917359104)

superhoops,"Your best bet for watching games is to buy the QPR+ streaming package from the club. Occasional technical difficulties but on the whole pretty good. ESPN+ only carries the matches that get picked up for television which is generally only a handful, but those aren't available via QPR+ so it's good to have both.",54,2019-07-02
superhoops,"Probably a bit long and no structure to it, but here you go:

Our dalliance in the Premier League wasn't good for the club as both Harry Redknapp and Mark Hughes spent millions on players, giving them high salaries, without actually thinking about how to put them in the team or whether they actually wanted to play for the club.

This financially crippled us, and relegation, with the lack of guaranteed income to pay these players, has impacted the team ever since. We have had to sell players when we could, and essentially buy on the cheap. 

There are two things that have been very important in the last couple of years with QPR - 'parachute payments' and 'Financial Fair Play (FFP)'. Parachute payments refer to money that teams relegated from the Premier League receive, I believe for 4 years after relegation. They ensure that teams don't immediately go under (due to high wages). The payments hav just run out for QPR, but unfortunately during those 4 years the club didn't really adjust well enough. This led to us letting our club captain, Nedum Onuoha, go for free a year ago as we couldn't afford his wages, and means that we're selling players for usually a lot less than they're worth as we need the money (and often need to get rid of players!). FFP also has a bearing here. Financial Fair Play is complicated, but can essentially be boiled down to 'spending reasonably within your means'. QPR haven't done this, and have been fined and threatened with the loss of points. The club has a tiny income and therefore FFP has also led to pressure and a need to sell players.

With all that financial fun it's led to a team that hasn't really got very good players as we've needed to pick them up on the cheap. There are still some shining lights. Luke Freeman is our best player by a mile, Massimo Luongo is an Australian international who can be great but is inconsistent, and Eberechi Eze is a fantastic prospect. Freeman and Luongo might be gone this month or next though haha.

With the manager, Warburton seems like a good recruitment. There weren't many good options for QPR as we don't have the best reputation at the moment (lots of managers have come and gone recently, there's not really any money). Warburton is great at setting up scouting networks, he has a clear tactical preference and he's had success in the division before. Judging him by our signings so far this season, he's been very sensible, got in some solid players, and we've got rid of a few players that we didn't really need - positive so far!

We are not aiming for promotion at all at the moment as the team just isn't in the right place, financially or to be honest mentally. We've finished poorly in the league in the last 2 seasons, and the best hopes are for a mid-table finish and a bit of respectability restored. Hopefully Warburton can use this season to set some groundwork to build upon for the future, and grow the club, but with QPR's recent luck I'm not gonna get my hopes up just yet!",538,2019-07-02
superhoops,"Depends who the team is at the time. Adam Hulme and Ian Taylor were rather decent for our club. Ian Taylor with the player interview etc. We also had London Calling. Adam Hulme has since gone to manage social media at Liverpool.

One thing I'll add is that Rangers aren't historically and likely never will be ""classy"". The fan favorites have all been mavericks or hard workers. My personal favorites were the mid-2000's teams where I could best describe the players as ""blue-collar"".

superhoops,Smyth directly involved in both goals as Wycombe draw Brentford 2-2,11,2019-07-22
superhoops,That is heart breaking if true! Not that he is a game changer or anything but he is a youth academy product with loads of upside and what I presume to be on a pretty fair wage. You have to assume this move is strictly financial as he is more than capable of being an everyday player at RB.,59,2019-07-22
superhoops,"I can see why some fans are disappointed with this move because it does seem to go against the ethos we are attempting to employ, with young players coming through the academy. However, I believe Rangel is a better Right-back than Furlong and we have enough depth at Centre-back now to not necessarily need him as cover. It looks like we might be getting Dujon Sterling in on loan from Chelsea who impressed at Coventry on loan last year and is confident on the ball, whereas Furlong regularly looked questionable on the ball.",93,2019-07-22

superhoops,*our own,2,2019-07-23
superhoops,"**Right back:**

With the loss of Furlong it is clear that Rangel is our starting RB.  We had hoped to get Sterling on loan but that move is now reportedly off.  Rangel, at 36, is unlikely to last the season.  Loanee Matthew Smith and Dominic Ball can both play right back but it isn't even close to their natural position.  Playing either of these two at right back will leave a gap in midfield.  We need to sign someone at right back, loan or otherwise.  Could get Baptiste back on a 1-year contract.

**Midfield:**

Let's get in Judge and Cameron.  We need to sell Luongo to recoup some of the 4 million we spent on him.  Our only senior team midfielder left is Scowen.  Smith is already dealing with an injury.  Amos and Ball have looked good in preseason so far.  Regardless, we still lack depth and experience.  The addition of Judge and Cameron will round out our midfield options.

**Attacker:**

Mlaka and Oteh are the only two recognized strikers in the team.  Neither are likely going to be sufficient to lead the line week-in week-out.  Need to bring in an experienced striker.  Bony and Hooper are available on a free, or we go down the loanee route again looking for someone similar to Wells or Hemed.

superhoops,"So having watched every available pre season friendly from the R's I thought I'd make a post on some patterns I personally noticed about how Mark wants us to kick the ball about, as I thought it might be useful if someone hasn't been able to watch the matches.

**Formation**

We've mostly played a 4-1-4-1, 4-3-3 or whatever you like to call it. A back four, midfield three including one mid sitting just in front of the back four, one box to box midfielder a bit further forward and one more attacking mid who still drops quite deep when needed. Two wingers and a striker obviously. 

[A example lineup](https://i.redd.it/kjjdeqxwwvc31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Attacking play**

Probably the most noticeable aspect is the very high tempo, whether it means running down the wing like a madman or passing the ball about in a quick fashion. Much emphasis on wingers to take their man on, but also on fullbacks to overlap to provide a safe secondary option for the winger. The high tempo applies also to aggressive pressing immediately after losing possession, where furthest midfield two join in as well. I'd imagine a important form of scoring goals this season will be getting on the end of crosses, whether it is by shooting or heading the ball into the net. 

**Keeping possession**

I can't be the only one who gets shivers down their spine when they hear ""playing from the back"" combined with QPR. Anyway, that's what Mark's trying to do, and it has looked okay IMO. Get used to our GK rolling the ball out quite a lot instead of trying to thump it for a opposition goal kick. The key will be whether Barbet, Hall, and Leistner (if he stays) are good enough on the ball. Barbet has seemed very confident, but Hall, having been out for so long, has understandably looked a bit off the pace here and there. Leistner is our best defender in terms of pure defending IMO, but hard to tell if he'll fit into Mark's system. 

**Defending**

Keeping possession is very closely knitted to this section. The style Mark apparently wants is that the first though will be to try to work our way out of the situation by keeping the ball on the ground and potentially starting a quick attack. Otherwise, defending is defending and there's no much more I can say about this matter.

**Potential issues**

There's no doubt that when Mark's tactics work it will look very pleasing on the eye and be effective on the pitch. But what are the main points where this style has a chance of coming short with the players we have?

1. Counter attacks. Everyone who has watched even one of the friendlies must have seen this. The flip side of having overlapping full backs is the huge space they leave behind them, which has been utilised by nearly all of our oppositions resulting in several 2v3 or 2v4 situations. The key here is to have proper knowledge of what the other 10 players have to do when a fullback goes on a run so that you can have even a partial coverage of the defensive third.
2. Situational knowledge. In other words, when to clear the ball to row Z and when to keep it on the ground for a potential counter attacking chance? Whether to pass the ball back in order to retain possession or to attempt a cross that might result in a attack your way? There have been a few occasions, just the latest one today, when we've attempted to play ourselves out of a too tricky situation, which for example resulted today in giving possession away in our own box in a very dangerous position. This will probably take some time to get properly fixed, but hoping that it doesn't lead to too many opposition goals. 
3. Reliance on crosses. What if the opposition has such a good backline that our wingers can't get into good crossing positions or our forwards just can't get into end of the crosses? Can't say we've passed our way through the middle too many times yet, but hoping that if it is needed they can do it. 

All of this being said, Pugh, Kane and Hugill are very good signings who will surely come in handy and can't wait to get ourselves a winning start at Stoke on Saturday! You R'ss!!",733,2019-07-27

Absolute madness that most clubs can't afford to buy average players from other clubs in the same division, and even lower league prospects are often ridiculously expensive. Surely it's got to change by lowering the asking prices or loosening the ffp regulations?",55,2019-07-29
superhoops,"Agree with a lot of this.  To the first point, Hugill will provide much improved finishing than... exactly.  His strike rate in his 20 apps for Middlesbrough last season was about 1 goal per 7 shots.  In his best season, with Preston in 2016/17, his strike rate was about the same.  To put that into perspective, Wells strike rate for us was about 1 goal per 14 shots.

On the topic of our youngsters.  With the exception of Furlong we actually saw quite a number of youth products on the pitch against Watford.  As a fan of this club there is a certain element of love that clouds my judgement when it comes to players who have come through our academy or that were snapped up as teenagers.  Particularly with these types of players they want to play for the badge and they might even love QPR as much as we do.  When we lose these types of player it hurts more than usual.  Take Harry Kane for example, he loves Tottenham.  He always wanted to play for Tottenham and that quality allows the team as a whole to punch above their weight as there is a reduced risk of Kane *wanting* to move to another club.  The point isn't that Kane and Furlong are similar in ability, they aren't, but that players who have loved their club since childhood can have a major impact on the team overall.

Joe Lumley, who has been with QPR since he was 15, is starting regularly for the first team.  Ilias Chair came in as a 19-year old two years ago.  If anyone watched the last 20 minutes against Watford you'll know that Chair showed real desire and almost produced the goods on two occasions.  He could have a breakout season.  Ryan Manning also came to the club as a 19-year old four year ago and has seen a significant uptick in first team appearances.  In fact, he appears locked into the left back role and could continue even when Wallace returns from injury.  Eberechi Eze came here as an 18-year old three years ago and is clearly locked into the first team.  Finally we have Olamide Shodipo, of who I've been a big fan of throughout his time here, who came to the club as a 15-year old seven years ago.  He has historically had back luck with injuries but I've seen the most out of him this preseason and he appears to factor into Warburton's plans.  All in all, it is exciting to see this many youngsters figure into the first team and shows that there is development going on within the youth ranks.",443,2019-07-29

His 2018 season review at Aberdeen:

>To bracket the defender as the best young Scot to have emerged in the Premiership this season would not be overstating the point. Quite simply the 21-year-old has been sensational since stepping up against Motherwell in September. Powerful, quick, good at reading the game and with the knack for a goal - remember his howitzer against Kilmarnock - McKenna has it all. And can still get better.  
>  
>McInnes rates him massively and booted out three bids from Hull City in the January window before McKenna signed a new deal taking him through to 2023.  
>  
>One criticism that could be levelled against the defender is he has failed to deal with the threat of Celtic and Rangers but that is more a collective than individual criticism and legendary Dons defender Alex McLeish has made him a first pick in his new-look Scotland side. The 6ft 3in defender was man of the match in Tuesday night's win in Hungary.

From a best defenders in SPL article:

>The young defender is a reminder that, regardless of how much you study and dissect football, it will always present you with things you just didn’t see coming.  
>  
>This time last year the centre-back had only recently completed a disappointing loan spell with Ayr United, where McKenna had long been relegated to the bench for some erratic play, including a brutal challenge on John McGinn in a Scottish Cup defeat at Easter Road. With little sign of a first-team place at Pittodrie on the horizon he was facing an uncertain future. If he couldn’t hack it at the Scottish Championship level then what kind of career did that leave?  
>  
>In the end he needn’t have worried. Pitched into the starting XI this season to add a bit more steel to the Aberdeen defence in place of Mark Reynolds, McKenna impressed in the 1-0 win. Soon the one-off success became a good month, then a good few months, and now a great first season, which has been rewarded with a Young Player of the Year nomination and international honours.  
>  
>Physically he’s everything you could ask for in a central defender. Broad, tall, robust and doesn’t run like he’s towing a tractor. But what’s been most impressive is his consistency. There have been a couple of shaky performances of late - most notably in the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Motherwell - but overall he’s made very few mistakes. He’s undoubtedly been the club’s best defender this term, and arguably their best player.

With 12 caps for Scotland at 22 years old, McKenna would be a fantastic signing.  Prying him away from Aberdeen will be the hard part.  Would likely have to pay upwards of 5-6 million.  Could potentially sell-on in a few years for twice that.  I do like the strategy of trying to make one big signing with a transfer fee though.",500,2019-07-30
superhoops,The risk seems to be more about if he can adapt to the championship. If he can then the ~5 million he'll be sold for will be pocket money compared to the eventual selling fee.,35,2019-07-30
superhoops,"Given what we had to work with this transfer window, I'd give our transfer window a B+. If we end up signing McKenna before the deadline, A/A+. 


I wouldn't be surprised for a slow start with so many new signings and a new style of play being implemented. I think our target should be mid table stability and I think we can reasonably achieve this.

Prediction: 11-13th

One to watch: Dom Ball",72,2019-08-02
superhoops,"Allowing myself to feel cautiously optimistic that this season won’t be the car-crash that FFP made it look like it was going to be. Whatever his successes and failures have been at his previous clubs Warburton has a clear vision having taken on a job that owing to the restrictions and requirements on the club no one wanted. 

Starting with a squad starkly different to the one that ended last season might be a good thing, hunger and willingness to adapt to the new boss’s plans. Some great signings on permanent/loan basis have given us a balanced squad. Still think we are slightly light up front, and this coupled with an entirely new system of play could be our undoing. I hope we don’t get cold feet and stick with the man and the plan until the season is done.

It was his legs and engine which cause the midfield diamond of Stoke's problems all afternoon. As soon as he went off, Rangers lost something despite his replacement being the promising signing of Marc Pugh.

superhoops,"Firstly, I think you need some context about football in Finland in general. First of all, football isn't really a popular sport to watch here. A pretty staggering example is that in my university class of approx 40 engineering students (read: 20-25 yo young men) I am the only one who follows football apart from watching the champions league and the world cup finals when they're on tv.

This lack of interest in domestic or european football allowed me to go without watching a SINGLE FOOTBALL MATCH until the 2014 world cup, during which I got to know a few guys at school who followed football a bit more. Even after that world cup all I really did was play a bit of Fifa now and then.

This is where QPR comes to play. You know when you have to select a favourite team when you create your Fifa account? Not really knowing anyone outside the top 6, but still having my usual mindset of supporting the underdog I thought to myself ""Nah let's go with this team called QPR, I think I can still change it later on"". I didn't really think about it as ""this is the team I'll support"", to be honest I'm not sure if I even intended to really support anyone at that point. But boy, only if I knew what I had just signed up for. I think I watched my first match because I found Charlie Austin hanging aroung the top scorer charts in the league interesting especially as QPR were in a relegation battle. It was a huge cluster of a being a underdog in a city with so many huge football clubs, a ridiculously small 18k capacity stadium and a relegation battle. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea but I found it really appealing.

The final nail in the coffin was when I visited London with my family in summer of 2015. We even had an apartment in west London, a walking distance away from LR. Because it was summertime I never got to a match and even the new kit wasn't released until the next week but all I got was a QPR coffee mug and a scarf from the hilariously named ""superstore"". As if that wasn't enough the Shepherds Bush area really seemed, and still seems, like a place where normal people live, and I found the area really nice.

The next 2015/16 season I went to complete the military service that is obligatory here, but surprisingly got to know two guys who followed football (and supported City and Liverpool \*sigh\*) who got to know more about QPR during that year than they probably ever would have. I listened to Finney and co.'s QPR podcast on my journeys there and back but that was about it in terms of following outside Twitter.

16/17 season I got the audio pass, and followed us a lot more than the previous season purely for the fact that I spent my weekends at home instead of in a foxhole with an assault rifle. The first game of 2017/18 was my first live match, 2-0 win against Reading and more staggeringly a Washington brace, after which I had just introduced myself to a very expensive hobby of travelling to the UK every year to watch a match or two.

If you had told me six years ago I'd be spending a ridiculous amount of my week watching or following some shite FOOTBALL TEAM from West London I wouldn't have believed you, but here I am thinking if we will start with Rangel or Kane next weekend having just finished booking my trains to the airport to fly over for the Cardiff (A) and Blackburn (H) double next month!

I’ll be visiting London (and UK as a whole) for the first time at the turn of the year and really want to see a football match while I’m there.

I asked on Reddit and based on the replies, decided I’ll go and see the QPR-Cardiff match on Jan 1st. Now I’m buying tickets, but I’ve run into a dilemma.

I was thinking of buying tickets to one of the stands that the biggest fans like to inhabit (according to the internet), most likely the Ellerslie Road Stand R-block. I just wanted to check if that’s an alright thing to do as a visitor who isn’t a fan of the club, since I don’t mean to be disrespectful.

I just think it might be an even better experience to watch the game with people who really love the club. I’m sorry if this is a strange question, I’m just not that familiar with English football culture on any deeper level.

I'm from Italy and I was in London travelling for business this weekend.

So, I had a free Saturday and decided to go watch a QPR game.

Stopped at Queens Tavern for a couple of ales, meet some incredibly nice people, and then straight into Loftus Road stadium.

The game and and the atmosphere were AMAZING. Got a scarf, sweater and home kit from the store. These memories will last forever, it was such an amazing experience. And I mean all of it, even if I was soaked in rain, it was one of the most fun things I did in a while.

So that's it. You've got a new fan.

Thank you to all of you fans and the team for the amazing performances!!

superhoops,"With all the financial talk lately I got curious and created a couple of graphs.

[https://i.imgur.com/inrg1YL.png](https://i.imgur.com/inrg1YL.png)

First up we have a simple graph of our wage bill (blue) and our place in the table (red).  As far as the wage bill goes you can see we start off relatively modestly, then balloon into an unsustainable mess as soon as we made it to the Premier League.  At the end of the 2014/2015 season, when we were relegated, we dropped the wage bill by almost 30 million by the start of the 2015/2016 season.  We have since spent the last three years reducing the wage bill even further.  At the end of the day, we are only a few million over from where we started almost a decade ago.

[https://i.imgur.com/nyC3Yie.png](https://i.imgur.com/nyC3Yie.png)

Next up we have a graph that I think corroborates Ferdinand's line that the club is heading in the right direction. Basically this graph is saying: How efficient are we with our wage bill in relation to where we finished in the table.  The higher the value the better.  In 2010/2011 we were very efficient, ultimately achieving promotion on a modest 20 million.  In our Premier League days our efficiency takes a turn for the worst.  Our wage bill balloons by 4x but our place in the table is rooted squarely in the relegation zone.  Since our return to the Championship we have trended towards up in our efficiency, making headway on becoming the club we were a decade ago.

I think we've really made significant strides towards becoming a sustainable club since our messy days in the Premier League.",269,2020-03-05

With football around the world being brought to a halt due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and the growing uncertainties about how this season will be played out, I have decided to take it upon myself to review the current squad and analyse how we may progress on in the next season with certain transfers.

I will try to keep possible transfer targets as realistic as possible, to do this I have attempted to adhere to what I believe is Mark Warburton’s transfer policies.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mark Warburton’s transfer policies**

* Tends to buy a mix of young players and older experienced players
* Often purchases players who he has previously managed (players from Brentford, Rangers &amp; Nottingham Forest)
* Often purchases players from Scotland, Premier League youth teams and Lower English leagues
* Favours players with resell value
* Signs a lot of players on free transfers

&amp;#x200B;

**Goalkeepers**

*Liam Kelly* (24)

&gt;Seems to have been an astute signing at around **£50,000**, *Kelly* has had a mixed season so far, the Scottish keeper had a slow start, failing to keep a clean sheet in 6 games, however following his penalty saving heroics against Leeds Kelly has kicked on and has shown how good he can actually be, keeping **3 clean sheets in the 10 games** following the initial drought. Although what makes *Kelly* stand out from the other keepers is his ball playing ability, he has an impressive **67% pass success** whilst accurately **playing 6.4 long passes per game**, this along with an impressive **1.5 saves in the penalty box per game** (which is the joint 5th best in the league) suggests that he has a successful future with the R’s.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Keep, first choice keeper**

&amp;#x200B;

*Seny Dieng* (25)

&gt;Having signed for us back in 2016 *Dieng* has not yet appeared for the first team, however, I feel he may finally get a chance to get some game time next season as he has impressed on his loan out at Doncaster Rovers. He has kept a very impressive **9 clean sheets in 27 appearances** in League One, this along with a great **pass success rate of 70.4%** suggests that he can fit straight into a Warburton passing style of play.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Keep, back-up keeper**

&amp;#x200B;

*Joe Lumley* (25)

&gt;Having joined the club as a youth player at 16 *Lumley* has had a very mixed career so far at the club, having impressed last season, keeping an imposing **14 clean sheets** in his first full season as the main goalkeeper, this form lead to him being rumoured to be joining either Bristol City or Aston Villa, but of course these moves never came to fruition and Lumley stayed. This season has been a polar opposite of the last though, Lumley has costed us on multiple occasions, suffering a huge **6 errors leading to goals**. This along with his failure to adapt to a passing style of play leads me to believe that *Lumley* could be on his way out.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Sell or loan out**",511,2020-04-26
superhoops,"I’m not sure about Kelly. I’d like to see Dieng given a chance as first choice keeper. I’m not convinced with Kelly’s ability to do the basics, like shot-stopping and commanding his area. 

He does the more eye-catching things well, I agree. But what I really miss about Smithies is his reliability. I didn’t tend to question whether he should have saved shots. With Kelly and Lumley I often wonder if they should have saved at the near post, got down to that shot, tipped that over the bar, had a stronger hand to that shot. And if I do, so might his teammates, which isn’t great for morale. 

Enjoyed the reports. Thanks.",113,2020-04-26

superhoops,"**Introduction**

It seems that most QPR fans are unanimous in the belief that our defence has held us back this season, whilst being the 3rd best scoring team this season we have conceded the 3rd most goals. In particular, it appears that we are lacking quality at Centre back and Right back. In this write up I will evaluate current squad depth focussing on the full backs and pick out transfer targets that seem applicable to Warburton’s key transfer policies.

[You can find the first part of this write up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/g8nhfc/squad_review_201920_part_1_goalkeepers/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Mark Warburton’s transfer policies**

· Tends to buy a mix of young players and older experienced players

· Often purchases players who he has previously managed (players from Brentford, Rangers &amp; Nottingham Forest)

· Often purchases players from Scotland, Premier League youth teams and Lower English leagues

· Favours players with resell value

· Signs a lot of players on free transfers

&amp;#x200B;

**Right Back**

It’s become apparent throughout the season that Warburton wants our team to play similar to how his previous sides have played with a 4231/433 formation that has both full backs being able to attack and defend effectively.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current squad depth**

*Angel Rangel* (37)

&gt;Upon signing a one-year contract extension *Rangel* has continued how he left off last season, he has been a fairly competent defender performing **1.5 tackles** and **0.9 interceptions** per game, whilst putting out an **average 0.3 key passes** and dribbles per game. The veteran has shared games with new signing *Todd Kane*, who appears to be worse defensively than *Rangel*. With his contract expiring at the end of June and *Rangel* not getting younger (**turning 38** in November) it could appear that his time with the R’s could be up, however I feel that Rangel is fit enough to fill in at Right Back if need be next season and he could be a vital role model to younger players in the team.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Keep, One year extension with role of coach offered at end**

&amp;#x200B;

*Todd Kane* (26)

&gt;Having signed on a free from Chelsea in the summer, *Kane* had high expectations to fill the void left by the departing *Darnell Furlong*, however a wide range of fans have agreed that he hasn’t been up to the mark this season, and despite playing more progressive passes than *Rangel* with **0.5 key passes per game** *Kane* only completes **0.1 dribbles per game**, the same as *Grant Hall* and less than *Connor Masterson*. Moreover, he has been poor defensively, constantly giving the ball away being **disposed 0.5 times per game**. Personally, I wouldn’t mind if Kane leaves and if we can get a decent amount of money I would take that in an instance.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Sell if possible**

&amp;#x200B;

*Osman Kakay* (22) – Out on loan at Patrick Thissle

&gt;Having been playing in the Scottish division this season I am unable to obtain stats to assess how well *Kakay* has done, however going of his limited playing time in the first team in previous seasons he has appeared to be able to perform well in the Championship. It seems like Patrick Thisle fans have been happy with his performances going off responses on twitter.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Keep/loan out**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential transfers**

*Joshua Emmanuel* (22) – Bolton – Valued at around **£300k** with contract expiring in **June**

&gt;Would be quite a **low risk transfe**r with his age and it being a free transfer, *Emmanuel* only moved to Bolton in the summer on a free from Ipswich but has impressed this season, performing a respectful **1.6 tackles** and **1 interception** per game whilst only getting **dribbled past 0.3 times** per game, the second best for right backs in the league. *Emmanuel* doesn’t only excel defensively though, he has completed **2.4 dribbles** per game, the most for a right back in league one and also carries out a decent **0.7 key passes per game**.

&amp;#x200B;

*Callum Brittain* (22) – MK Dons – Valued at around **£250k** with contract expiring in **June**

&gt;Another low risk transfer as he is young and would be a free transfer, *Brittain* is a better passer of the ball than *Emmanuel*, providing **1 key pass per game** with an overall pass success of 77.5%, he also completes a great **1.6 dribbles** per game. However, *Brittain* isn’t as good defensively, only putting out **1 tackle** and **0.5 interceptions** per game, this may be due to him playing various positions on the pitch however.

&amp;#x200B;

*Moses Odubajo* (26) – Sheffield Wednesday – Valued at around **£1m** with contract ending in **June**

&gt;*Odubajo* has been **unlucky with injuries** throughout his career, he was arguably the best Championship right back in the league in his promotion season with Hull City and, was also one of the best upcoming youth talents in the league with Brentford in the 14/15 season under Warburton. This season he has been great defensively with **2.5 tackles** and **1.1 interceptions** per game, going forward however *Odubajo* has struggled, only producing **0.3 key passes** and only completing **0.5 dribbles per game**. *Odubajo* would be a risky transfer due to his injury history, but with his past relationship with Warburton and the fact that this would be a free transfer could make this a worthwhile deal.

&amp;#x200B;

*Perry Ng* (23) – Crewe Alexandra – Valued at around **£500k** with contract ending in **2021**

&gt;By far the best Right back in League Two this season, *Ng* has been brilliant defensively, executing **2.3 tackles (most in league)** and **1.2 interceptions** per game (3rd most in league). He has also been great going forward, providing **2 goals** and **6 assists**, aswell as providing **1.3 key passes (most in league)** and **1.9 dribbles per game (most in league)**. The fact that he has is playing in League Two may bring suspension as to whether he could make the jump up two levels to the Championship, however there have been many players that have adapted to this jump in recent years, these include Adam Webster, Matt Grimes and Ollie Watkins.

&amp;#x200B;

**My ranking of potential transfer targets:**

1. Joshua Emmanuel
2. Moses Odubajo
3. Perry Ng
4. Callum Brittain

&amp;#x200B;

**Left Back**

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Squad depth**

*Ryan Manning* (23)

&gt;The makeshift Left back at the end of last season, *Manning* has performed well at his first full season at full back this season, he has been great going forward **scoring twice** and providing **5 assists**. He has produced the **highest amount of key passes in the league** from left back with **1.9 per game**, and also has completed **0.9 dribbles** per game, a respectable amount. However, despite stats suggesting Manning has been great defensively with **2.3 tackles** and **1.4 interceptions** per game, he has been **inconsistent defensively** in parts. *Manning* has been linked with moves away from the R’s to Premier League teams, but I feel unless we can get a decent fee above the reported £5m we should keep him.

**Verdict – Keep, first choice Left Back**

&amp;#x200B;

*Lee Wallace* (32)

&gt;Due to injuries *Wallace* didn’t make his league debut at left back until **mid-December**, this had led to him falling behind Manning in the pecking order. Despite this *Wallace* has been consistent at Left back and a decent left sided Centre back in a back 3, defensively he has made **1.6 tackles**, **1.5 interceptions** and **2 clearances** per game. However, going forward *Wallace* has struggled only producing **0.6 key passes** and completing **0.2 dribbles per game**. With his contract ending next summer we shouldn’t be rushing to give the aging, injury prone player a contract extension anytime soon.

**Verdict – Keep, back up Left Back and Centre Back**

&amp;#x200B;

*Niko Hämäläinen* (23) – Out on loan at Kilmarnock

&gt;*Hämäläinen* has been out on loan in Scotland this season and has seemingly **performed well according to the Kilmarnock fans** on social media. He has performed well going forward providing **2 assists** but there aren’t any stats available to analyse how he’s played defensively. With his **contract expiring in June** we should move fast to extend it to ensure we don’t lose a potential talent on a free. If we manage to get him to sign a new contract we can expect *Hämäläinen* to **play sporadically** throughout the season as he could fill in for *Manning* who can also play in the midfield and *Wallace* who is injury prone and can play at Centre Back.

**Verdict – Keep, extend contract**",1410,2020-04-29
superhoops,"Encouraging that there’s quite a few decent fullbacks coming available. We’ve definitely struggled a bit with right back and it looks likely we might lose Manning. I’d like Kakay to be given a bit of a chance but interesting to see what Warburton thinks of him. 

Thanks for these write ups. Really enjoyed them.",54,2020-04-29
superhoops,"I definitely agree regarding Manning. He has really grown into his role and I think will only get better going forward. He has been at QPR for 5.5 years and is still only 23!

Need a long-term RB for sure, but. I think Rangel can be serviceable in the Championship for one more year and hopefully put in 20-25 starts.

superhoops,"Plenty to choose from but I’ll go with someone that is less likely to be chosen by anyone else and that is Danny Shittu. 

Came to the club at a time when we were desperate, signed by the fans after impressing on loan. Raw, strong, dominant. Him and Carlisle & the back still probably my favourite CB pairing in years.

Met him a few times over the year. Always an absolute gentleman. 

Felt so bad for him when he did his knee. He played the game out with ruptured ligaments and didn’t even realise. What a beast.

superhoops,"Welcome! You need to know about the 75/76 season, where QPR beat Leeds at Loftus Road in their final match to go a point ahead of Liverpool at the top of the English Football League. Sadly Liverpool still had one game to play, away to relegation threatened Wolves, and due to Liverpool's European commitments it was not played until ten days later. For those ten days little QPR were Champions of England. And when it was finally played, Wolves scored first and held on until 13 mins from the end, when Liverpool equalized and then went on to score two more to claim the 1976 title. Most players from that team are considered QPR legends. It was something like this: 1 - Phil Parkes, 2 - Dave Clement, 3 - Ian Gillard, 4 - Terry Venables, 5 - Frank McLintock, 6 - David Webb, 7 - Dave Thomas, 8 - Gerry Francis, 9 - Don Masson, 10 - Stan Bowles, 11 - Don Givens, (12 - Mick Leach).

In all the polls I've seen (and I've seen a few), Stan Bowles has always been voted QPR's best ever player with Rodney Marsh a close second and the rest of the pack a way back. Gerry Francis 3rd for me -- he did captain England, after all!",216,2020-05-21
superhoops,"Welcome! Hopefully you'll have a chance to visit at some point - the club's history and tradition is very much part of its present, and that's best experienced at Loftus Road. 

It's fantastic to hear from fans around the world from yourself, but as a relatively small club the majority of the fan base are locals, born into QPR families. And when I say locals, I mean local to a pretty small area of London. Loftus Road reflects that - it's an old-fashioned ground, boxed into the housing estate that supplies some of its support. It's literally embedded in its community. Football clubs in Britain have an integral relationship with their local communities, particularly workers. That's faded a bit since they've become huge businesses in their own right, but QPR has one of the best run charities in British sport. Because of that closeness between the club and the people, Loftus Road is a great place to watch football and experience what it means, historically, to the area.

A lot of the old pros still hang around the ground or are involved in the running of the club, so if you're interested there's a decent chance you  grab one for a quick handshake. It'll all seem pretty titchy and old school if you're used to the scale and shinyness of US sport, but if you like it, it'll hook you for life.

If you wanted to look up one player who sums up QPR it's probably Stan Bowles. And he's not even a Londoner. He was one of QPR's vaunted number 10's, a mercurial, skillful, shaggy-haired attacker who sustained a pretty full-on gambling addiction all through his playing days (and beyond). He lives just south of the river I think and used to sign autographs outside of the club shop on most match days, but sadly has alzheimers now and hasn't been seen for a while. Still, at most home games the fans still clap throughout the 10th minute to show that they're thinking of him. As good an example as any of how the history lives at Loftus Road.",350,2020-05-21
superhoops,"Welcome! I'd highly recommend listening to the QPR podcast, they regularly cover not only what's going on with the club now but our history. 

I'd also watch the four year plan on amazon prime. It's a fly on the wall documentary about the club's current ownership before our current owners and the circus that QPR was between 2009 and 2011.

Generally we're a club known for finding and developing unknown young players and selling them onto bigger clubs for a profit whilst playing attractive attacking football and we have a history for maverick attacking midfielders who wear the 10 shirt (Stan Bowles, Adel Taaeabt, Rodney Marsh, Eze).

In the last decade our current owners tried changing this by spending big on established stars and it didn't really work and got the club into a lot of debt. Since our last relegation from the premier League and the appointment of former star striker Les Ferdinand as director of football we've tried to go back to the old ways of developing unknown players with mixed results but we've seen real progress this season under Mark Warburton's management.

superhoops,"Some Backstory: I'm from the US and have only begun getting into soccer/football within the past year or so, which mostly started with me and some of my friends playing FIFA. I came to support QPR through a FIFA 18 Player Career Mode, where I was transferred from the worst club in the game to QPR. Since then I've kept a passive interest in the club, and watched a couple of matches here and there before everything shut down. I even ended up with a personalized GK shirt for Christmas just because I thought it looked cool. 

Now I want to learn more about the club: What is some of the history, what are the traditions, who are the club legends, what should I know about the current squad, etc. Any info would be appreciated, as I want to watch more matches after things get back to normal.",148,2020-05-21
superhoops,Welcome to the family! I’ve been a supporter all my life (mid twenties) and seen us play in 3 different divisions. Let me know if you have any questions :),30,2020-05-21
superhoops,"Hey! I'm a relatively new supporter too, nice to know there's a few of us. 

In terms of the new squad, I'd say that the main focus at the moment is new, young talent. The club was in the Premier League a couple of times in the past decade, and that basically ended up with the signing of a bunch of players who were good in their day, but past their prike/players who took home a big paycheque but didn't do much for the club. The club seems to have turned a corner on this - if you look up highlight reels of Ebere Eze (almost certainly our best player and a lot of talk about him) Bright Osayi-Samuel, Ilias Chair they're maybe the biggest prospects. In general the current manager Mark Warburton had a limited budget in his first transfer window so had to sign a lot of young or unknown prospects, and is performing above expectations with his current results.

In terms of history and former legends, I'm not the most qualified to say, but I can reccommend listening to the last few episodes of Open All Rs (a fan podcast) where they talk through things like their favourite games, favourite players dating back to the 70s and 80s - this has given me a good insight and will help you get an insight into the nature of the fans, the club, past players etc. Also the club has been streaming season reviews of some big seasons e.g. 75/76 (highest ever league finish), 2010/11 (promotion winning) as well as big games eg 1967 league cup win.

superhoops,"I love these types of threads, thanks for the contribution.

The financial position of our club means we lose a lot of players we should otherwise have kept to push on.  The likes of Smithies, Luongo, Freeman, Furlong, and now Hall just to name a few.  It also means we can't afford to sign players like Nahki Wells.  Frankly, it is depressing.  I remember in the 90s Francis said he'd leave the club if we started selling our stars.  Now we are a selling club..  I worry about our ambitions.

On the other hand, Hoos has straightened out, financially, a few clubs before us who are all in the Premier League now.  In the last decade we've managed to reduce our wage bill substantially and in the process become somewhat financially sustainable.  Important to look at both sides of the coin I suppose.

As far as LB goes, I disagree that Manning has been defensively poor this year.  Arguably I think he has been one of our top three players this season, behind Eze and Bright.  I really don't see us bringing in another LB unless Manning is sold in the window.  His contract is up at the end of next season, he is surely a saleable asset, and it is unlikely our finances will allow him to resign.  This means that we could lose him along with Eze and Bright this transfer window.  Better we sell them though than get nothing, but the lack of continuity will make next season that much more difficult.

At RB we have Rangel along with Kakay and Kane.  Rangel's age means his time in the team is limited.  I don't see either LB/RB as big a priority as CB.  Losing Hall is definitely a blow to the team.  From what I've seen of Masterson he could have a regular place in the team, but he is young.  Barbet has been inconsistent this year, but has shown flashes of ability that leave me feeling hopeful.  It is the depth that is the problem, woefully so.  Bringing in another CB on a deal, and potentially another on loan, must be a priority.

CM is another area where a signing will be a priority.  Ball and Cameron can do a job, but we need more quality and youth.

Striker is the last position that I would say is an absolute priority.  Thankfully, with transfer money incoming from the sale of Eze (and maybe others) we may finally be able to invest in some quality players.

Mostly I agree with you, just trimmed out LB and RB from the list of priorities which will hopefully add more focus to our transfer window.

Potential candidates (all contract expiring end of season): 

CB: Ryan Shotton, Jake Cooper, Shaun Hutchinson.

CM: Niclas Eliasson, Alex Mowatt.

ST: Sammy Ameobi, Michael Jacobs, Harry Cornick.",472,2020-06-27
superhoops,"After the past 2 performances I thought I'd breakdown how I see the current squad and plans for next season.  


GK - We all know Lumley is error prone and cost us points at the start of the season. For me the jury is still out on Kelly, he's had some good performances and was quick to come out today against Charlton, but I cant help but feel like he has a mistake in him. I would probably look for a keeper in the next window. (Not Joe Hart. He left Man City because he couldnt play football with his feet and thats exactly what Warburton will expect from him. Disaster waiting to happen and wages will be too high).  


LB - A priority. Manning has had some good performances this season but defensively he's been consistently poor. I dont think there's been a winger this season that hasnt turned him inside out at some stage of the game. He has a great left foot and puts in some great crosses on his day but defensively its a disaster. Havent seen too much of Wallace but its clear he's coming towards the end of his career and is prone to injury.  


RB - A priority. Rangel been a great servant and somehow still puts in a shift at 37 years of age. My concern is that he gets in the team ahead of 26 year old Todd Kane who signed a 3 year deal with us at the start of the season. 3 years and he has looked nothing short of hopeless every time he has played. Maybe he needs a run of games to get some momentum going but my god it doesnt look promising. I hear lots of talk about Kakay but I think part of going down the academy route is recognising that not every player that comes through will make it, and not every player is good enough. We naturally look to him as the RB that has been been through our system and had loans etc but I personally dont think he's good enough.  


CB - A priority. I like Barbet when he's alongside someone that can do the dirty work. Classy player on his day and his left foot is great but I think he needs an experienced head by his side to compliment his ball playing style. When you put Masterson next to him it just looks a bit of a shambles, although I do think Masterson has a future at the club. Hall had his injury problems but was a good CB at this level when fit. He played 30 games this season and is a big loss for these last few games.  


***When the assessment is that Barbet is the only player I would start in our back 5 next season, its no suprise that we concede so many goals and look so poor at the back. Shambles.***  


CM - A priority. I cant make my mind up on Dom Ball or Luke Amos. Both have shown glimpses of what they're capable of but equally have had some #### poor performances this season. I think they both make good squad players but if I'm being perfectly honest I just dont think they're good enough to start if we want to push for top half and the top 6. I can understand Geoff signing a new deal, he's an experienced head and clearly has quality even though its fading. Another problem area for us.  


CAM, LM, RM - I've grouped these positions together because its clear under Warburton that the 3 of them rotate and are expected to be competent in each of the 3 positions. Recruitment here is obviously dependent on what happens with Eze and Bright. Assuming that we lose them both (which is looking increasingly likely based on Les and Lee's recent interviews) then this becomes a priority area for us, but for now its definitely our strongest area. I like Chair and think he has a big future ahead of him, he has a part to play over the next few seasons and hopefully fulfills his potential.  


ST - A priority. I actually think Hugill is a good striker at this level. He'll never make it in the premier league because he clearly lacks composure and loves to miss a sitter. That being said, he finds himself in the right places and always has a goal in him with the right players behind him. West Ham will want money for him that we definitely wont (and shouldnt) pay so I think we'll be parting ways at the end of the season. Yet again this leaves us light in this position (I sound like a broken record), with Oteh as the only recognised striker at the club. Oteh for me is similar to the Kakay situation, he's clearly not good enough. 1 goal in 13 appearances at Walsall and 3 goals in 18 appearances at Bradford just doesnt cut it. I'm all for promoting youth and looking to the academy but part of that is accepting that some players arent good enough.  


So the conclusion is that I would buy a new GK, LB, RB, CB, CM and ST. The only positions I feel as though we're strong are the front 3 behind the striker, but thats including Eze and Bright who are inevitably leaving. What does this mean? Another rebuild...  


I'm ok with rebuilding as long as this time its done with more quality. We signed 13 players this season for just £50,000 which on paper is fantastic business. When you assess the likes of Dom Ball, Marc Pugh, Liam Kelly, Geoff Cameron etc based on what they came in for then you can call it good business. But if we really want to push on to greater things now then the money we sell Eze and Bright for MUST be invested in the squad. I dont have faith that the club will get a lot of money for the pair of them, so hypothetically lets say we make £10m from their sales. Even if only half of that is invested in the squad its significantly more than the £50,000 spent this season. I dont want to hear excuses from the board next season if we lose our star players 'well it was always going to be harder after losing the likes of Eze and Bright'. The narrative we have been sold is that we make no revenue from ticket sales so our transfer business must be funded by player sales. Next season will be the first for a long time that we have made considerable money from player sales and the board should be judged accordingly. I understand FFP and I like that we are trying to be more sustainable, but there is no excuse for not investing in the squad next season. Here's hoping that we see some progress, although I have little faith.",1158,2020-06-27
superhoops,"I think GK should really be less of a priority than some of the other more pressing needs.  As others have said, I think Kelly is a decent enough Championship starter provided the defense is strengthened.  I've also read a lot of good things about Seny Dieng, on loan right now at Doncaster.  If you can get a quality option for free obviously you'd consider it, but I don't think it's too big of a concern going into next season.",80,2020-06-27

superhoops,"**Introduction**

Thanks for the support on the two previous instalments of this squad review, if you haven’t yet seen these you can find the [first part here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/g8nhfc/squad_review_201920_part_1_goalkeepers/) and the [second part here](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/ga8vwc/squad_review_201920_part_2_full_backs/).

As I stated in the last part it seems that is well known within the R’s faithful that our defence is holding us back this season, in particular we are lacking in quality at Right back and Centre back. In this part I am going to discuss the current squad depth at Centre half and some transfer targets who we can look to get in.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mark Warburton’s transfer policies**

· Tends to buy a mix of young players and older experienced players

· Often purchases players who he has previously managed (players from Brentford, Rangers &amp; Nottingham Forest)

· Often purchases players from Scotland, Premier League youth teams and Lower English leagues

· Favours players with resell value

· Signs a lot of players on free transfers

&amp;#x200B;

**Current squad depth**

&amp;#x200B;

*Yoann Barbet* (26)

&gt;From his first appearance in a pre-season friendly against Austria Vienna it was apparent how **great of a passer** *Barbet* was, performing diags across the pitch with immense precision. This ability is shown in how he has **played the most accurate long passes (8.1) per game** for a centre half in the league, this is done whilst maintaining a **great 78.9% pass success** overall. There was early worries about *Barbet* diving in needlessly in the box and giving away penalties, however these soon subsidised when his defensive prowess was shown, putting out **1.1 tackles** and an **immense 2.4 interceptions per 90 minutes**. His importance to the squad became evident when he was away injured, with *Barbet* in the squad we have maintained a 50% win percentage and without we have a measly 21.1% win percentage, accentuating his prominence in the squad.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Keep, first choice Centre Back**

&amp;#x200B;

*Connor Masterson* (21)

&gt;Another great coup from the summer, *Masterson* failed to make a first team appearance in the league until January, however he has been **impressive in most games** he’s played thus far, playing an **average of 61 passes per game** with an astounding **86.1% accuracy**. Despite this, Masterson hasn’t displayed the best defensive stats, only making **0.8 tackles** and **interceptions** per 90 minutes, regardless of these statistical shortcomings *Masterson* **hasn’t been dribbled past** in his 675 minutes of game time, this stat could be **wrongly calculated** though as it appears that he was dribbled past in the lead up to Barnsley’s goal in our first game back. It seems *Masterson* has a great future ahead of him and we should look to pin him down to a long term contract with his current one ending in **2021**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Keep, play sporadically as back up**

&amp;#x200B;

*Toni Leistner* (29)

&gt;**Last season’s captain**, *Leistner* was one of our **only consistent performers** last term and he has impressed when he’s played this season, however *Leistner* has made it evident that he **doesn’t want to return** to play for the R’s and therefore we should look to get rid of him in the transfer window. The German Centre half was **linked with a move to Aston Villa for around £5m** in the summer but now with only a year left on his contract I would be happy with a **fee around £3m**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Verdict – Sell**

&amp;#x200B;

*Other players:*

*Joe Gubbins* (18) has been in and around the first team training throughout the year and it appears that he **may be in line to make a first team appearance** before the end of the season.

*Themis Kefalas* (20) has been **out on loan at Billericay** in the Vanarama National league south this season, he has **played well** according to fans.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential transfers**

With the recent departure of *Grant Hall* and the imminent departure of *Toni Leistner* it would appear that we may enter the summer transfer window with only two first team Centre backs. This is of course a huge issue and if one of *Barbet* or *Masterson* were to get injured or suspended, we would be seriously lacking. Therefore, I believe we should be looking to get at least two centre backs in this summer, with one of us these being a more experienced player over the age of 25 and the other being a younger defender with resell ability.

&amp;#x200B;

I have compiled a list of players I feel we should be targeting as they follow Warburton’s transfer policies and, they would fill the current void we have in depth in this position.

&amp;#x200B;

*Reece Burke* (23) – Hull City – Valued at around **£3m** with contract ending in **2021**

*Cedric Kipre* (23) – Wigan Athletic – Valued at around **£3m** with contract ending in **2021**

*Mike van der Hoorn* (27) – Swansea – Valued at around **£6m** with contract ending in **June**

*Ryan Shotton* (31) – Middlesborough – Valued at around **£3m** with contract ending in **June**

*Naby Sarr* (26) – Charlton Athletic – Valued at around **£1m** with contract ending in **June**

*Chey Dunkley* (28) – Wigan Athletic – Valued at around **£1.5m** with contract ending in **June**

*Jon Stankovic* (24) – Huddersfield – Valued at around **£2.5m** with contract ending in **June**

*Matty Pearson* (26) – Luton – Valued at around **£1.5m** with contract ending in **2021**.

*Yoan Zouma* (21) – Bolton – Valued at around **£250k** with contact ending in **June**

*Richard Nartey* (21) – Chelsea (loaned at Burton this season) – Valued at around **£500k** and has been **released**

*Luke Woolfenden* (21) – Ipswich – Valued at around **£1.5m** with contract ending in **2022**

*Ross Sykes* (20) – Accrington Stanley – Valued at around **£500k** with contract ending in **2022**

*Alfie Kilgour* (21) – Bristol Rovers – Valued at around **£500k** with contract ending in **2021**

*Ben Heneghan* (26) – Sheffield United (loaned at Blackpool this season) – Valued at around £**500k** and has been **released**

*Micheal Ihiekwe* (27) – Rotherham – Valued at around **£1m** with contract ending in **2022**

*Ryan Edwards* (26) – Blackpool – Valued at around **£250k** with contract ending in **2021**

*Eoghan O’Connell* (24) – Rochdale – Valued at around **£400k** with contract ending in **2021**

*Jonathan Dinzeyi* (20) – Tottenham – Valued at around **£50k** and is set to be released, he also had a **trial with the u23’s** in Februrary.

*Jack Fitzwater* (22) – West Brom – Valued at around **£300k** and has been **released**.

*Scott McKenna* (24) – Aberdeen – Valued at around **£5m** with contract ending in **2023** and was **heavily linked to join last summer**.

&amp;#x200B;

Below I have compared all these players statically with *Barbet, Masterson* and the departing *Hall*. Statistics for *Dinzeyi, Fitzwater* and *McKenna* are unavailable for this season.

People forget but when Millwall released him years ago, other clubs he trialed with rejected him too.  He said he almost hung up his boots, until QPR called.

If he sees QPR as having saved his career, that could be quite a motivator to stay.  If we sell BOS, Manning... maybe we free up enough funds to actually resign with QPR.  I understand we have a strict wage structure, but Eze is a once in a decade player, and I can think of no other player who has earned it more than he has.  Get another crack to thrive and grow in the Championship before moving the Premier League.

superhoops,"Because people don’t understand the work that’s been put in to cut the wage bill from 80m a year to under 20m a year. They think that QPR should be buying everyone who’s on the market when players like Assombalonga command fees of over £10m. 

They also don’t seem to remember that three of the better players in midfield from last season (Freeman, Mass, The Rat [Scowen]) have also gone. 

Warburton has essentially worked miracles without spending a thing. Finishing 13th while being carried by a 20-something year old Eze for a season is no mean feat. If there’s a way to properly invest the money made from BOS, Eze and Manning then it’s because of the work Ferdinand and Hoos have done over the past couple of seasons. There are a dozen clubs who are more fucked financially than QPR this summer, which is why they were able to battle for Kieffer Moore (remember paying money for an actual striker?)

Will be interesting to see what happens this summer, but the leg up from this season’s success is a sure fire way to a good start tbh.",188,2020-08-08

superhoops,"He likes the squad, has made friends within the team and as others have said has come back from a knee explosion. 

Think that we can judge how good he is after another full season under his belt tbh, you have to remember last year was his first full season ever at this level so you’d expect him to kick on now. And if he doesn’t then the fee won’t have killed the finances. 

Remember where Eze, BOS, and Chair were after they’d made less than 50 starts, I’m prepared to back him and see what kind of player he is after he’s made 150 appearances.",106,2020-08-17

The club had $53m Net Credit in 2019. We have plenty of money. The club just doesn’t have a huge Revenue compared to expenses - partially because of a smaller stadium, partially because we haven’t had any huge sales in recent years. Selling Eze will do ya nicely.",95,2020-08-20

Closest I could get was by saying ‘he’s like a slightly more advanced Gazza sort of of player’.

superhoops,"as a defender facing him in any given position on the pitch, you would genuinely not know whether he's going to run at you, shoot from distance, tee someone up, or literally anything else.

it's like he's playing a very slightly different, more chaotic type of game to everybody else, but to him it makes total sense and his decisions are invariably very good.

even though in the PL he'll get more regularly closed down, knocked about, and overall not have the same fear factor as in the EFL, he will usually be the best player to watch throughout a game.

For me, losing him is like when Bowie died - it's sad, but we were so lucky to have him when we did.",124,2020-08-27
superhoops,"I see a bit of a similarity between him and Alphonso Davies tbh. Though as a QPR and Canadian/Whitecaps fan, those are easily the two most exciting players I've watched over the past few seasons, so take it with a grain of salt. They both have incredible speed, great spacial awareness off the ball, and always seem to find room. Also, both can get an accurate shot off incredibly quickly. Obviously fonzie is in a league of his own, but again, lots of similarities imo.",85,2020-08-27

He glides with the ball, and makes people look stupid a lot, is fast but is so effortless with it that he doesn’t look like he can burn people. But still does that.

Warbs did say that we should expect a fair few signings in the coming weeks, so hopefully that will fill in some of the rather large gaps in our squad.

Just reflecting on your write up, jeez does it feel good to flood our list with young talent. Fair dinkum, especially after all those players in the redknapp/Hughes era...",63,2020-08-30
superhoops,"Just less than two months since the end of last season and the competitive season starts again. QPR face off against Plymouth in the League Cup next weekend.

Our final, also second, preseason fixture against Oxford ended today in a 1-0 defeat.  A team which narrowly missed promotion to the Championship last season, QPR should've been able to produce more than they did.  Positives came in fits and starts, but we find ourselves in a nervy situation moving forward.

Clearly we've just made a club-record sale as Eze goes off for a deal worth up to 20 million.  The strategy of developing your own is finally bearing fruit.  Great, we'll be able to use that to shore up a few gaps in defense... midfield... striker. Maybe not, as Warburton has made clear, ""We will be looking at free transfers, low costs, loan market etc – along with many other clubs.""  We've only made two ""true"" signings so far but hopefully we spend at least a little to strengthen where necessary.  A center back would be nice, even if just for depth, to make up for the exit of Leistner, Hall, and Rangel.  Masterson is on a run but he is still young and will inevitably experience a dip in form.  With only two named right backs, it would be ideal if this someone could cover over there too.  In the midfield, another option in case Ball or Cameron go down might not be a bad idea either.  Lastly, up top.  Even though Dykes was scoring readily for Livingstone, we took a least a bit of a punt there.  Behind him are Oteh and Ramkilde.  From what I've seen so far of those two, maybe this is an area where we will yet again dip into the loan market.  Even if can make a few more signings though, there is little time for them to gel with the team.

At the back, based on what we've seen so far, you'd have to start with Lumley or even Dieng.  Kelly did well enough, but his passing was cringingly wayward.  The defense seems solid enough but it is depth and experience that we lack.  Most excitingly in the defense is Kakay, who has to be clear favourite to Kane by this point.  Like Masterson however, Kakay is also young.  In several instances last season, Rangel was brought in to halt lengthly losing runs.  That type of experience in defense is something we need desperately.  However, the pace of both Kakay and Manning could mean for a deadly wing-back combination.  There are a whole host of options in the midfield.  Finding the right combination here will be key for Warburton.  We look to be starting with Chair, Bright, and Amos.  However, Shodipo, Battache, Thomas, Smyth, and even Alfa could also play a part.  Of the subs today, Smyth appeared particularly dangerous, beating players and creating chances.  Up top, here is hoping the hold up play of Dykes can be of benefit to all of those players.

To add confusion though, the contracts of Bright and Manning are up at the end of the season.  If they don't extend they'll surely leave on a free and if an offer does come through, I can't imagine the club won't sell.  Worse still is that if Kakay, Masterson, Hämäläinen, or Smyth turn out to be saleable assets, their contracts are also up at the end of the season.

Looks like we'll be relying heavily on the existing squad, especially our youngsters, for at least the beginning portion of the season.  As far as what the club has been preaching for the last few years, this does all appear to be part of the plan.  It is exciting, as we will hopefully see more youngsters develop similarly to Eze. If we can plug up a few holes we may still start the season timidly, but hopefully we'll finish strong.

Now I ask this with a slightly rhetoric intent. I became a fan during the 13/14 championship season but had been following them since 11/12 around the first stint back in the Prem with the promise of a rich future ahead and some big name signings (who in turn hugely let us down). 

I just wanted to know your thoughts into where we came from and how from potentially being the first Man City are now fighting it out in the Championship Mid-Table again. I understand with the last few years more focus has been put on developing youth and turning into a selling club which is probably a much better direction but when do you all realistically think we could be back in the top tier and actually stay where we belong?

I apologise if any of this sounds ignorant, I just want to know more about the club I love and support and hear straight from the long time supporters if possible.

Find a way to watch ""The Four Year Plan"". It's only a short part of our history but the documentary picked a team to follow during an amazing period.",65,2020-09-26
superhoops,"Fellow international fan here (USA) since 2010.

To answer your question... 

Lots of financial mismanagement from 2011 through 2015 that has followed us for a long time. We have had to aggressively decrease the wage bill to the point that we have one of the lower wage paid teams in the championship, so we are actually punching above our weight right now.

To stay somewhat competitive, QPR has been doing a combination of the following:

* scouring the country for players who have been discarded from other clubs like BOS and Eze
* taking on solid if unspectacular older players like Cameron and Wallace 
* promoting players from our own youth team like Darnell Furlong and Kakay
* in recent years, we have also got strikers on loan who were too expensive to buy like Nahki and Hugill, but it seems we do not have enough money to pay for wages of players like that

If you compare this strategy to what teams in the top 6 of the championship are doing, it is very clear we are at a competitive disadvantage. I think continuing to stay financially solvent while fielding a team that can finish 10th-18th is sadly the goal for the short and medium term. To prepare for a return to the premier league, the team likely needs a new training ground, stadium, etc. I personally prefer the championship, but I also want us to get promoted every year. Supporting this club is a strange affliction.",248,2020-09-26
superhoops,"Harry redknapp happened - see west ham, Portsmouth etc

Oh and rangers pre prem had always been the best paying club in London 

A better training ground is the first step -as that's the players main office - stadium is a really fine until rangers go stellar again",48,2020-09-26
superhoops,"Been a fan since the mid/late 90s. Probably fair to say we occupied a position similar to that that Burnley or Southampton do now.

Overall I think most of what's gone wrong in the intervening years has been a result of acting like we just 'deserve' to be in the top division, rather than earning it. Half the Football League could claim they 'deserve' to be in the top flight, but the truth is no one does by right.

Might be an unpopular opinion, but I think we've been relatively fortunate over FFP - no points deductions, no relegations, forced to operate sustainably, and to me it feels like we're emerging as a better club. I can see us being serious contenders in 5-10 years, and I think we'll be far better-placed to stay up, so it'll be completely worth it.",141,2020-09-26
superhoops,"Who would be a good but realistic replacement for eze be to buy in fifa career mode 21, thinking I need a cam, gk, but not sure about other positions, what do you think?",34,2020-09-28
superhoops,"We can't realistically afford anyone to actually replace him, as he was so much better than the rest of the team! We're being very stingy with money at the moment, so bargain signings and loans are the way to go. I don't think many players are on more than 10-15k either, and they are the high earners. Chair is definitely promising though he's not going to win games on his own like Eze could.

We need a new LB as Manning is looking to leave, though if he does stay he's more than good enough. New CB and RB are probably needed. We've just signed a CB, but he doesn't look that great so far. Kakay at RB is young and promising, but a bit raw. Kane, who he's replaced could be sold.

Midfield wise we're not too bad, though need a winger I reckon. Put Chair in the hole and then sign someone who can whip some crosses into Dykes, or someone more creative who can link up with Chair.

I personally don't rate Amos, who we've just signed, but he'll probably do alright for you in deeper midfield alongside Cameron, who you'll need to sign a replacement for pretty soon!

Oh and although you could sign a keeper I'm not sure it'd be realistic as we have two vying for Number 1 (both in poor form) and we started a young lad in our last game (league too, not cup).",242,2020-09-28

I really like Ossie-- he puts a foot into challenges, has great energy, is good in the air, and he seems to have an infectiously positive attitude.

superhoops,After all the signings during the window I thought we were going to be competitive and have an outside shot at moving up. It’s heart breaking to see a lack of goals.,32,2020-10-27
superhoops,"Don’t know why I care so much but I do. That’s my week ruined. Thought the club was moving in the right direction and signings looked decent (wasn’t convinced with Bonne). Thought we hadn’t spent the money on crap like we did when we sold Les. 

Despite the result tonight, think the back 5 with Dieng, Kakay, Dickie (although ffs tonight), and maybe hameliaen, it’s a slight improvement on last year? The problems come in midfield and upfront. 

Think our front 2 are very suspect; CMs lack creativity; Chair is not currently capable of opening the door for us. When playing this “total football”, passing from the back, you need a creative mind to create some chances. With no BOS we have gone from a Lower mid table side to a bottom 6 team. Losing Eze, Hugill, Wells and Manning is c£40m of quality players. Replaced with only one proven quality player (Adomah, 32). 

With sheff Wednesday on minus points and Wycombe in the league, we can’t go down.....can we? 

Seriously need a playmaker. 

Think we have to stick with Warburton; but if he doesn’t get a win in the next 3 or 4, what can you do!? 

Everything stressing me out at the moment lads. Love to all the rangers boys. Hard to keep faith in anything at the moment isn’t it ?",224,2020-10-27
superhoops,"There is a lot of doom and gloom right now. I think it's important to focus on the positives that we can continue to build on. 

1. We seem to have found a goalkeeper. I have been impressed with Dieng-- his shotstopping, distribution, and command of the box all look superior to what we have had over the past couple of years. 6'4"" and just 25 years old, he could be a top keeper going forward. 
2. You cannot fault the effort of the players. Unlike some earlier versions of the team, I never dislike our players and want them to succeed.
3. Osman Kakay has been at QPR since 2005 and has patiently worked his way into the XI. Up until the end of the match he was making runs forward and covering back, making blocks. He clearly loves the club and continues to improve.
4. I am convinced we have uncovered a gem in Lyndon Dykes. His service hasn't been the best, but he challenges for balls with tenacity, has proven himself for Scotland, and shown good endeavor for QPR thus far.
5. Dom Ball is a real battler in midfield. I can see him playing a Derry role for us-- good work rate, knows his role, and a solid physical presence in the middle of the field. Now if we could just find an Ale Faurln to play alongside him...",233,2020-10-27

I think we'll turn it around, like /u/Deadend_Friend said, we've been competitive in most games and have actually managed to keep a few clean sheets.

superhoops,"I'd agree with all of those points. Adomah has been good and gives a nice option down the right when he is at full fitness, he seems to pair well with Kakay as well...

superhoops,"I think its sheer panic in the penalty box. This is a stretch, but it may perpetuated through the lack of confidence in our keeping?

superhoops,"It’s a well bandied-about fact that we only had six clean sheets last season, and although we’ve had three so far this season, it might have gone unnoticed that we’ve conceded FIVE penalties in the last FOUR games. 

I’d say this should be a massive focus for the defenders at the moment during training and subsequently in games. Great win Sat against Cardiff, don’t want to take anything away from that. But we won’t be able to rely on a Dom Ball screamer every week.",85,2020-11-01
superhoops,Cant account for utter stupidity. Last two was both very avoidable. I even think barbet was lucky not to be red carded. Even Dickie pen was because barbet slide in to try and cut the ball out. Screams of poor positioning but also a lack of shielding in the midfield. Both the pen vs Barnsley and first versus Cardiff were balls played through the middle of our team. So the midfield have something to be accountable for.,77,2020-11-01
superhoops,"My inexpert take is that the defenders are far too focused on preventing shots at any cost. I don’t know if that’s coaching, or some form of mild PTSD from playing in front of keepers they did not trust all least season. I personally notice myself adjusting the way I play when I’m in front of a keeper who doesn’t make routine saves. 

In my opinion, they should dial back the aggressive tackling just half a notch. Let Dieng do his job. Honestly, I really like what I see in the young keeper. I can see why Doncaster supporters were raving about him. His command of the box is excellent, and he was really unlucky on the second pen yesterday. 

I don’t think we are up in danger of going up, but I think the team is better than what they’ve shown over the first part of the season.",149,2020-11-01

superhoops,No harm in it,4,2021-01-03
superhoops,"Unless BOS goes then I don't think so. Giving him a full season under his belt is best for him, not to bring him back from loan only for him to watch Carroll out on the wing instead of him and be limited to 20 minute cameos",47,2021-01-03

superhoops,"I used to absolutely bloody love the FA Cup. I remember Spurs' Jurgen Klinsmann once saying that the English love the Cup more than the league. He was not wrong. And a good Cup run was a nice little financial bonus for a club too. But since the advent of the Premier League and the so-called Champions League (apparently named by Oceania's ""Ministry of Truth"") and associated riches, the venerable FA Cup, the World's oldest competition, is now just a place for blooding youngsters and giving your fringe players and reserve keeper a bit of match practice. Very sad. And, for me anyway, it doesn't even diminish the pain of QPR's record in the competition over the last 3 decades probably being 92nd out of 92. Even the odd win in recent years never looked like turning into a Cup run. As usual two weakened teams will be striving for an early exit so that they can concentrate on the league, no doubt both thankful to have avoided the minnows in the draw and associated embarrassment with a loss. QPR will surely win the battle to lose. Can we call that a win?

What he lacks is consistency with crossing and finishing. He is a patchy player who looks like a great player one week but like he has no ability or confidence the next.

He is young and has great potential but he hasn’t shown enough to prove he is a European level player yet for me. Could become one though with the right coaching. You will be able to get him cheap and I believe it probably is worth it for you to sign him.",103,2021-01-15

superhoops,"Are you a fener fan?

He's a winger that can beat a man and has a frame where he is tough to win the ball from. In terms of output, he's decent but won't rake up a huge amount of goals/assists. Seemed to play a lot better for us when he wasn't the ""main man"" with Eze/Wells around him.

superhoops,"Bit of a weird one! But I've been making FM content on YouTube for around 4 months now, and my first long term save is with QPR! I'm planning on doing a save every year maybe even two, called championship to champions league, basically winning the champions league with a team that starts in the championship. Starting with QPR!

I've just started Season Three, and I'll be honest things are going extremely well! I'd be over the moon if any of you guys fancies giving me a watch and sticking around for the save!

If you're wondering why I chose QPR as my first save even though I'm a Middlesbrough fan - well a few seasons ago I went to QPR away on my birthday, I fell in love with the ground, and had an amazing weekend down there, getting the three points helped and a hell of a goal from George Friend, but I've had a little soft spot for QPR ever since, can't wait to come back to the ground one day something I think we all can't wait to do!

superhoops,"Couldn't believe I saw some people questioning the signing when he returned. 

Honestly can say I'm prouder of QPR last night - winning with Charlie and Uncle Albert scoring to put us just 17th!! - than of any result we got last time we were in the prem. 

Rangers lads that bleed blue and white. Bollocks to all those mercenaries. We feel like a proper club again.",67,2021-02-02
superhoops,"Been a fan since we were promoted the first time with Adel and that lot, and he’s definitely my favourite player. 

Mates of mine who are friends of big clubs ask me (from Australia with no real tie to the club from a parent or even friends) what it’s like to follow smaller clubs, because it’s not like we’re contending for championships any time soon. I just tell them that we end up latching onto moments and players that are meaningful to us. The Derby game at Wembley, for one. Beating Chelsea in 2013. 

Charlie is one of those players that means something to the fans of this club, and the club seems to mean something to him. Love having him back, even for a little bit. It reminds me of when Thierry Henry went to Arsenal on loan while he was with NY Red Bulls. Obviously Charlie isn’t Henry, but he brings up the same meaning to me.",159,2021-02-02
superhoops,"I often see comments about him being slow / broken.  I haven't been able to watch a full match since his return to the club.  Is he he really that bad (speed/health wise) or is it just ""he's older so he must be broken""?",44,2021-02-02

superhoops,"As a serb, I love this moment",7,2021-02-02
superhoops,"The whole team’s energy changed when he returned. The playmakers can feel confident someone will finish the chances they create, and it’s clear Charlie is having fun and enjoying significant playing time at a club where he’s appreciated. I’m so glad he’s back, and I hope whenever he departs again, the club does a proper job finding a striker in his style to replace him.

A great finisher is the difference between a relegation fight and a playoff push in this league. It’s too late and the overall team is too poor to consider anything ambitious this season, but it’s an encouraging step in the right direction.",107,2021-02-02

superhoops,...of Charlie signing with us permanently on a free? His contract is up in may according to transfermarkt and he's eligible to sign a pre contract agreement I believe. He knows that as long as he's fit we'll play him. We've got no other finishers like him in the team.,50,2021-02-07
superhoops,QPR is where it all seems to fall into place for Charlie. We love him and I'm pretty sure he loves us. I doubt whether he is going to get any massive offers from elsewhere and he'd be a fool to ditch QPR for a few extra grand. He is back where he belongs.,54,2021-02-07
superhoops,"He recently appeared on 5 Live's 72+ show and was talking about the latter years of his career. He essentially said he's in a place in his life where he doesn't want to uproot his family and move, so unless he got an unbelievable offer, I think he'd stay around the London/South East region.

Only real alternative to QPR would be perhaps Reading, given where he lives.

If we offered him a two year deal at £15k a week, with an option to extend, plus captaincy, I think he snaps it up.",92,2021-02-07
superhoops,Depends on how the rest of his loan plays out and what his wage demands are.,16,2021-02-07
superhoops,"Money will be a factor (not shocking) but depending how the rest of the season goes, I could see it but ideally it would be a year to year thing. I wouldn't want to lock him up for a 2-3 year contract to only have that blow up (injuries should be a concern).

That said, he seems like a great fit with the young guys and does understand his role.",70,2021-02-07
superhoops,"So long as it fits within our budget we should definitely snap him up on a deal.  Further to your point, we haven't owned a natural finisher since Charlie left in 2016.",32,2021-02-07
superhoops,Done.,1,2021-02-08
superhoops,"You got it boss. Just completed.

Commercial activity for smaller clubs is certainly an interesting topic of discussion. I’ll freely admit that it’s harder for me to stay in tune with the finances of the club as a fan who lives thousands of miles away. Since I can’t go to matches, I try to financially support the club in other ways - through merchandising, paying to watch game streams, etc. I think not having the reliable television money of the Premier League combined with the fact that Championship fan bases tend to be smaller is a double edged sword. It’s a lot more difficult for the club to achieve sustainable success - yet fan engagement tends to be very high because we feel that our dollar—er, pound?—actually means something to the club. Even as an international fan, I feel the level of access QPR provides to fans is much higher than a big club - and certainly higher than any major professional sports club in America.

We’ve seen the consequences of financial overreach firsthand over the past few years. I’ll never be 100% comfortable with aggressive monetization of sport, but as long as ticket prices remain reasonable, I’ll support the club in whatever it needs to do to remain financially sound. When we make it back to the Premier League - and we will, one day - I don’t want to spend the entire season fearing the financial consequences of relegation.",241,2021-02-08

Hi there,

I'm a 3rd year University student currently collecting data for my dissertation, looking into supporters perceptions of the commercial challenges facing clubs operating in the EFL Championship. I am hoping for answers from a wide range of supporters from different teams across the league. If you have a spare 5 minutes and are willing to offer your thoughts on the topic, it will be greatly appreciated and will help out massively! 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Please feel free to remove this post if not allowed :)

For me, I’d be absolutely thrilled with a top half finish but I’d be satisfied with 14th, given how the season started. Last seasons 14th place team finished with 56, which would be a point/game going forward. 

In the grand scheme of things, 14th would be a disappointment compared to last seasons 13th. But given we were nipping at the heels of relegation a month ago, I’ll take it as a win overall.",101,2021-02-19

superhoops,"I think if we bring in Austin permanently then we could see either Bonne or Kelman (who I think is more likely) go out on loan next season.
Reason behind Kelman being more likely. He is seen as a long term project player, so wouldn't be surprised for him to go out on loan to a league 1 team next year. Similarly to how Masterson was shipped out earlier this year (although unfortunate with the injury), would be good for development to be playing week in, week out, something I don't think he will get next season if Austin is made permanent (which I think is definitely Plan A).",109,2021-04-13

Bonne still has a place in the team for me but his lack of playing time over the last few games is concerning.  His finishing has been poor but the other aspects of his game are in line with what I'd expect from a player in the Championship.",80,2021-04-13

I want to develop interest in a championship club and would like to know about QPR.I have great interest in English football and have followed the PL since years. 
I would like to know why you support QPR and what are the clubs plans in the upcoming future? 

This is not a situation where I just start supporting a club but would love to know more about the club from it’s fans before I watch the games next season and then naturally develop an affinity towards the club. 
Thank you!",92,2021-05-31
superhoops,"I’ve never been to London. I have no connection whatsoever. But I worked in a an Irish pub in NYC in 2009-11. We were always jammed with prem team supporters and Celtic supporters. I resented all of them because on game day I’d have to come in at 5am to get the place ready. Chelsea fans would show up at 7, still drunk from the night before and make my life a living hell. I despised them. 

But one, cold, snowy day on a random Wednesday. The place was empty and this guy came in asking to turn on Championship football. We wouldn’t normally turn on an obscure game but literally no one else was there so we obliged. He worked in the Empire State Building and we were across the street but he had taken the rest of the day off because QPR simply wasn’t televised and this was a rare occasion. 

I noticed the stadium was bizarre compared to most of the ones I knew well. I thought the team name was quirky too (New York Rangers being my first love, Queens Park Rangers was quite interesting). But what sold me was that this guy was just so nice. So thankful that he could take the day off and come sit for 90 mins and watch his team - which he hadn’t been able to watch in years it seemed like. 

After he left, I checked in on them periodically, hoping they did well for his sake. They got promoted to the prem at the end of that season and the next season I was suddenly watching every game. 

All my friends support giant EPL teams. To me it’s way more fun to support a club like QPR. You have to earn your glory.",296,2021-05-31
superhoops,"My mum grew up near Loftus Road and my dad supported the club. They moved to Canada in the late 60s and my dad tried his best to follow the club.  For a long time, the best he could get was the odd score in the newspaper if QPR was playing a large club.  

As a kid in Canada, we really didn't the EPL until the mid 90s and we could only watch the top teams. My dad would still try to catch anything QPR but it was tough (still a lot of limited news over here). We would watch Manchester United matches mostly b/c those were the ones they showed and we loved Beckham's free kicks. It was how we bonded over football vs. just the world cup every 4 years.

As the years went on and the internet grew, we could finally focus more on QPR (although tough to watch). Youtube clips helped a lot and so much more news access.  

Sadly he passed away in 2011 so he never got to see the rise of the club to the EPL and fall and the playoff final and so on.  The club meant a lot to him and in turn, me as well.  I am so happy for the QPR Podcast as that is my major connection to the club and I can watch matches so much easier now with streams.  

One thing I will say about supporting QPR: it is never a dull day. There is always some sort of chaos going on which as a sports fan, it's great.",263,2021-05-31
superhoops,"As an American R I am supporting QPR amongst my glory hunter friends which is really rewarding as you appreciate the club for who they are and not strictly what they achieve. With everything we’ve done with Kiyan Prince we are so often reminded that we are a special club. The inclusivity of QPR has been felt when interacting with R’s supporters near and far. 

It also should be mentioned that Adel Taarabt on his day was single handedly one of the most entertaining players I’ve ever seen. Never had so much fun watching football than when Adel stepped on the pitch and there was that possibility he would put on a show. 💙🤍",114,2021-05-31

superhoops,"Mine is a pretty odd reason to support them. It actually started because of fifa.... was choosing random teams to do a career mode with. Really liked their jerseys so decided to run with them. Then later on in the year I tuned into the playoff final and found myself rooting for them. Then that Bobby Zamora goal happened and holy shit was I jacked to the titts. I was finally able to catch a lot more games on tv since I live in the states. I’ve been keeping tabs on them ever since. Then last year I was sent to England on a work trip but unfortunately I was staying in derby the entire time, literally walking distance from their stadium. None of my colleagues wanted to join me so I decided to take the 2 to 3 hour trip down to London to catch a QPR game. I got a few of the recommended pubs before the match and enjoyed the atmosphere but the best part was the walk into the stadium... I thought it was amazing how you seem to walk through a neighborhood then right out of no where the stadium appears. The atmosphere was something else. All my life I had dreamed of going to a match where the fans chant and sing songs and I got exactly that during the match. I was rubbing shoulders with the dude next to me but that didn’t bother me much haha. I watched us come back from down 2-0 against stoke and all the banter that came with it it was great. The cherry on top was watching Eze effortlessly glide through the pitch. He’s an unbelievable player man. But yeah that’s just my story on how I’m a lifelong qpr fan",295,2021-05-31
superhoops,"Like a few other commenters, I was indoctrinated by my father, who grew up watching them in their glory days of the 1970s. They fell off massively and have managed to enter a massive financial slump and a revolving door of talented players. We left the UK when I was small to live in the USA and I watched their games with my father every chance we had as a sort of bonding ritual, with my most clear memories starting with that promotion season ten years ago now. 

You never know what you're going to get, and can only hope for a positive performance instead of the rather spoiled, narrow-minded expectation to win that you get from most fans of the top clubs these days. Every game is a journey through every conceivable emotion known to man, and this is only what I gathered from watching streams from another continent. When I was 16, I finally got to Loftus Road with my father and saw a thoroughly disappointing and crushing defeat to Hull on Boxing Day after the R's had had the lead. Luckily we also had tickets for one match later: the 6-1 win against Cardiff City (biggest home win for a decade or something), a team in a similar position that had no expectation to be as completely played off of the park as they were. To be in such a unique environment with other QPR fans after a short lifetime of having to explain to American fans of the new ""Big 6"" who QPR were brings me almost to tears of joy just from the memory. Of course, some of the fans are toxic and some isolated players and backroomers a bit rotten behind the scenes, but at its core QPR is a tight-knit, family and community club with a wonderful history and, if nothing else, exciting and unpredictable football that persists to this day.",318,2021-05-31
superhoops,"I honestly don’t think most people could explain what it is about QPR they love. They’re consistently ‘bang average’. A severely outdated stadium but one that still carries an unmatched atmosphere on a cold tuesday night in January. A toxic (not everybody) fanbase in terms of running their own players out of the club and a merry-go-round of managers who aren’t good enough but that looks like it may have stopped for a while.

If actually going to games is an option for you, I would suggest just that. Go to a game, sit as close to Block R as you can get, and see for yourself why people love QPR",111,2021-05-31
superhoops,"Was indoctrinated by my Dad at first, but grew to love the team. Being an underdog always attracted me, I like the kit and I love the ground, despite how out of date it is. There aren't many stadiums where you are so close to pitch.

During the more recent Premier League years I fell out of love with the club as the players and managers we had were just there for the money and there was a sense that they just didn't care. In the last 5 or so years though, we've once again become the team we once were - caring about the community, getting players in that want to play for the club and being a team that's worth supporting again. 

As the other poster mentioned, Ferdinand and Hoos have really improved the club's general outlook, and everything the club has done with Kiyan Prince has been fantastic. Makes me feel proud to support the club. 

We're still not a club that'll bring a lot of success, but if that was all I cared about, I'd support one of those rubbish ESL teams.",186,2021-05-31
superhoops,"All my friends supported big 6 clubs. I live in Washington state. Needed a club to root for because I didn’t want to fall into the lull of rooting for someone like United. When QPR beat Chelsea in their first stint in the prem, I made sure to rub it in one of my friend’s face. Absolutely couldn’t stand Chelsea, which just made rooting for QPR more sweet. Then the heartbreak of Aguero scoring also was felt, I did not want to see a different friend satisfied with a city title. Fastforward a bit, didn’t follow the team much until I saw on Twitter that they were in the playoff final (and I was still in high school, so didn’t necessarily have the time or ability). The playoff final happened to also fall on a day I was hanging out with my prom date, who I was so smitten with. I woke up at 7 am, found an illegal stream for the game, and I was hooked. Tears were had when O’Neil was sent off. Gasps were had for some of the insane saves made by Green. And oh my god, once Bobby put that goal in the back of the net, the whole house was awake. I had never been more thrilled in my life. That’s when I was 100% QPR. May 24, 2014 ended up being the best day of my life, and it’s not even close. Followed them closely for the abysmal 14–15 campaign. But was in love with the team. Also a lot of picking QPR in fifa 15. Vargas was incredible. The thing that made QPR most special, was that I had never met another fan in person. I have seen one guy, in Vegas 2019, with a QPR shirt on, and straight up ran up and hugged the dude. But it makes rooting for the team even more special. Can’t wait for the day when I make it across the pond and see my team play. Can’t wait to meet some of the regulars I’ve interacted with on Twitter. It’s more than a team. It’s a family. And holy shit I love my QPR family.",361,2021-05-31
superhoops,"I support QPR because my family have supported them from generation to generation dating back to the 1950s my great grandmother may have worked at the club at some stage but not 100% sure. It’s a big bonding experience for our family. It’s a club that was and still is to a point working class and inclusive we have fans from all kinds of backgrounds and ethnicities. The fanbase isn’t massive but it’s highly devoted. It’s very community driven too. A people’s club. Our involvement with the kiyan Prince foundation and Grenfell tower really shows this. 
Future plans are well keep the players we have and build on that but we are a selling club so it’s going to be difficult. One thing I really love about our club is the emphasis on producing our own players and bringing them through the academy to the first team. So it’s exciting at the moment because we could be seeing a new star player blossom in front of us next season we don’t know yet! We have a new training ground on the way after a lot of set backs which will help the club grow. In the far future hopefully a new stadium as much as i love loftus road we need to expand and to bring in more non-matchday revenue. Next season could be intresting for us, a play off push i think is possible but depends on what we do with recruitment.",243,2021-05-31

superhoops,"This is a copy and paste job from what I wrote on a similar thread  on r/soccer a while back. Should give u a bit of a run down why I go for the Rs

I support QPR from down under. My connection with the club is a weird one as I’m the first to really support any football team and have no connection to the west London areas or the uk in general. But long story short they had similar colors to my Aussie Rules team their was a starting point. Upon further research and watching the odd game I feel in love with  the uniqueness and quirkiness of loftus road, the logo and the club in general, they even have quite the Aussie influence within West London area in which they play in. Seeing their work the work they do within the community also pleased me quite a bit. The Bobby Zamora goal is one of my favorites spirting moments of all time, not just because of the goal but the celebrations and the commentary are perfect. The way the club has handled itself with the BLM controversy about not kneeling , and the classiness they showed with their response also allowed me to see they had the same moral as I do, it can be seen that Les Ferdinand is installing a welcoming culture within the club but also one that says they will stand up for what they believe in. I know we are pretty rubbish at the best of times and promotion looks unlikely, but I can see I’ve chosen the right team for al the above factors.",273,2021-05-31

It would be a huge help if any English national football team supporters would fill out our survey (18+ years old only) to help us in understanding people's thoughts and feelings regarding their team in the upcoming Euro 2021 (or Euro 2020 as it also still referred to as).

Ideally, we would like to track these thoughts and feelings throughout the Euro 2021 with subsequent follow-up surveys (again, \~ 5 mins). To help incentivise participation throughout all of the surveys, we are offering a £50 amazon voucher by way of lottery to participants who make it through to the final survey.

More details of the study can be found in the following link:

superhoops,"I don't know. Maybe worth a low-ball effort to bring in Varane as a backup to Barbet and Dickie. I don't see him breaking into the squad honestly, but perhaps we could loan him out to Oxford for a spell. We owe them.",43,2021-07-01
superhoops,"It seems like the fanbase as a whole is expecting play offs next season.

superhoops,Not sure if it’s because I’m used to American sports but I don’t understand why you’d ever want a mediocre season. Why not hope for playoffs? I’m pulling for promotion so I can finally watch them on TV.,38,2021-07-05
superhoops,"Nah, it has to be playoffs if we sign Johansen. Too much money involved there",15,2021-07-05
superhoops,"I think top half is the floor for what I would call an acceptable season. I’m very much in the camp that doesn’t want to be promoted this year, just because the squad isn’t prepared for it. I think we only really have 5 players that would crack even a bad Premier League squad at all - Charlie, Ilias, Dickie, Seny and Lyndon. Even then I’m not convinced of any of them except Seny being Premier League quality.

If we somehow got promoted, it would probably lead to a scramble to add better players and we know how that went last time. We’d be the worst team in the Prem, I’m almost sure of that. 

To me, this season needs to be a consolidation year. Playoffs would be a remarkable year, 7-9 would be great, 10-12 would be satisfactory. Anything below a top half finish is a poor season imo.",150,2021-07-05
superhoops,"I get what you mean. This is still very much a work in progress. For me, another top 10 finish represents stability and I wouldn't be unhappy with that. But the ambition has to be challenging for the playoffs.

Realistically, we're not challenging for automatic promotion. But a target to further close the gap to the top six doesn't seem outlandish.

There needs to be patience though. Something we're not exactly famed for.",73,2021-07-05

superhoops,"There is a documentary called The Four Year Plan (it’s on Amazon prime in the UK. You might be able to find it elsewhere) and basically talks about how they were on the verge of bankruptcy in 2007. As I live local-ish, you understand what they do for the community with the charity work they did for Grenfell Tower (in June 2017, a fire broke out in a 24-storey tower block) and more recently changing the stadium’s name from Loftus Road to Kiyan Prince Foundation (Kiyan Prince was a youth prospect at QPR and one day at school he was trying to spilt up friends having a fight at school, got in between them and one kid pull out a knife and stabbed him in the heart. So now Mark Prince, Kiyan’s dad, goes around educating youth on knife crime and it’s consequences as this is an ongoing problem in London). This is why I fell in love with the club. 

If you’re following QPR for the underdog glory, I think you have to understand how much gung-ho they were with their finances leaving them breaking finical fair-play and having to pay £42m but later a [settlement ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.com/sport/football/44980113.amp) was agreed as it was claimed unlawful. Since then we’ve been in the championship, trying to keep the ship afloat. Getting rid of the big names and focusing more on youth players and the youth academy (Eze being the greatest example. Recently sold to Crystal Palace for £16m + £4m add ons). Have to say QPR have managed to get a really good squad together (Charlie Austin, who the club adores, is a great example of the characters at our club. Recently rejoined us and taking a wage cut. Just watch [Highlights of his goals](https://youtu.be/o13A11FaSYw)) and found a manager, Mark Warburton, who we can rely on and he recently signed a new contract. The club has been very inconsistent with managers since being relegated years ago.

If you really want to get a great sense of what it is like to be a QPR fan then I really recommend Clive Whittingham's [Loft for Words](https://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/) blog.

Clive gives a lovely introduction to the recent history of the club in a post from last week:

> If Queens Park Rangers is your team, then for much of the recent past you’ve been more baggage handler than football supporter. This is a club that comes with more strings attached than a Thunderbirds puppet. There have been multiple periods of extreme boom and bust, from rattling buckets to keep the boat afloat to a director’s box full of some of the world’s most notoriously rich people, often in the blink of an eye. There have been promotions, relegations, administrations and more than one death. There has been innovation, cunning and craft, precedents and standards set, records broken. And there has been rank incompetence, chronic mismanagement, and criminality. Titles have been clung to through FA hearings, diplomatic incidents have blown up with the Chinese, and guns have been brandished in boardrooms necessitating a weeklong trips out to Southwark Crown Court for ourselves. It is warmly referred to as a ‘spiv club’ by its former captain and lifelong fan Marc Bircham, and it’s impossible to shake the notion that it is “always up to something”.

In short, welcome, but be prepared to have the full football experience. This is not a club for the faint of heart that want to politely golf clap as the team lurches to a predictable finish. Strap in and get ready for the ride of your life.

superhoops,"Find another team 😂

Nah, I am just joking. Plenty of fun and despair being a QPR fan. 

In terms of tips:

1. As of this season, I have always been able to find a stream. If you're having issues, maybe PM me (I should be available for about 50% of the games)

2. If you want news that isn't just dribble, go to the West London Sport website. You can follow their journalists on Twiiter too if that is your thing.

3. There are a few QPR podcasts, but I stick to ""Open all R's"" and West London Sport on YouTube.

4. Clive Whittacker has the best write ups in the business over at Loft For Words.

5. Enjoy the ride 🙂 In all sincerity, the community and vibe of this club is great. There are also some great users on this Reddit that are frequent and insightful.

PS: I am from Australia, so my opinion may not be that significant but I always found the ""football"" v ""soccer"" debate absolutely daft. [Relevant](https://youtu.be/1prhCWO_518)",174,2023-01-12

It is a tough team to support because they will break your heart. Like earlier this season, I was 100% convinced they were getting promoted. They were in a sweet spot on the table and everything was looking groovy. Just when I was all ready to be back in the Premiership it all went to hell.

This feels familiar to me because all the US teams I support are EXACTLY LIKE THIS. I don't know if you follow MLB, NFL, or NBA but if you do I am a Mets, Jets, and Knicks fan so you understand I understand frustration.

The club itself is really cool to their supporters, at least in my experience. It's why I root for QPR. I haven't been too active on this sub but whenever I do post I have felt welcome and nobody has given me trouble about being American lol.

I do recommend subscribing to QPR+ at least for the audio. It's not that expensive and you can follow all the matches. Because this club is in Championship, it's not very easy for us to see the matches on American television, so QPR+ is the way to go. Until they get promoted. You can watch every EPL match on Peacock. 

I can probably help guide you through some of the American side of English soccer if you have further questions.",262,2023-01-12

Honestly don't know where we go from here, 10 points off the bottom three and 2 games ahead of most down there. I'd of said Warnock but the ship has sailed there. Nothing left to do than maybe beg for Warbs back and hope we get 2021 rather than 2022 out of him.",136,2023-02-14

With everyone fit and firing, our best team can contend in this league (evidenced by being top), but we don’t have the depth to handle any sort of adversity. A few injured, a few out of form, we’re fucked (as we can all currently see).

Overall we need an overhaul. We need more depth, we need strikers, we need players that aren’t injured all the time (where the fuck Balogun go?!) we need new directors and probably new owners as well.

However this about a motivational manager I don’t buy. Last night regularly I heard the turgid yells “get it forward” as QPR recycle the ball amongst the back live & midfield. The same play QPR have played since Warburton to Beale. That team can’t change something that is in their DNA. To those fans I would say that don’t understand finer points of the game as QPR way is to work the ball until space presents itself for quick incisive ball.

However with no Stef, Willock, & a midfield of Dozzell & Tim, this team just can’t play to that same standard. 

I don’t think sacking the manager is the right move. He needs time to pull this team around. 
The team is low on confidence and I don’t a sacking will give us the uplift. 

It’s time he puts his stamp on the team now. Then give him pre-season to build his own team in how he wants them to play. This team has gone through Warburton, Beale & needs a reset.

Once done, they relaxed into their normal modes & none more so than Austin, who seemed to fall of a cliff with form & goals. Coincidentally, that was the season that the team didn't progress & Warbs was no more.

Yes we went top with Beale, but the decline already started while he was still at the club & it hasn't changed since.

Now we supposedly take another teams manager, because we can't be any better than Rangers etc..., but what credentials does Gareth have in this division again? Getting relegated :(

I really hope I'm wrong, but going on past evidence, this looks like it will be a disastrous appointment, made in haste to subdue certain fans only.

Just once, I'd like to see them make hasty decisions about getting rid of the players who consistently fail to perform, pretty frequently.

I hope Gareth sticks with Wycombe, who have the best form over the last 5 games of any team in div 1 at the moment & they stuck with him, even when getting relegated, so clearly loyalty isn't something he thinks much of either, if he's talking to us now :(",235,2023-02-21

superhoops,"Geezer is a bullshitter of the highest levels. But he's not the main reason we're in our current position. We have a DoF who allowed Beale to buy his players. He also bought players like bonne, dozzell, balogun, fucked off Barbet for Glass-salter the list goes on. The loans we've hired are atrocious. Roberts attitude and commitment is shocking. He can fuck off. Laird is scared of getting hurt, richards is.. no idea. Never seen the bloke. Tim Iroegbunam is a good player but not what we needed. His loan gives us zero benefit.

Removing Warburton was the mistake. Even with the bounce we got from beale. It was Willock fueled. When Willock was a player we could rely on. After he fell off a cliff form wise so did rangers.

Loaning Masterson whilst Dickie has been playing like this is shrewd. Even getting rid of Thomas a player who at least gives 100% would help the fight for survival. We need a miracle now chairs done his hamstring. Talking of which was is our sport science/fitness team doing as we've had so many muscle injuries.

superhoops,"One thing nobody can say about Ozzy is that he goes missing. Even during his worst performances he's been there.

He does have one major flaw however - ball watching. It's a real killer for him because he's a player who will put himself on the line and try and attack. The Hull offside was worse than it seemed, but it sort of depicts our situation that our back four can't really get going for months now.

I actually think he'd be more suited as a right sided centre back of a back three. He's played there before and done better than right back.",104,2023-02-28

I remember one story on the fan boards at the time saying that the ambulance might not come to Loftus Road if called because they were not getting paid. In that desperate hour the club sold one of our few assets, winger Lee Cook, to Fulham. Cookie was a long time fan of Rangers and donated his £250,000 signing-on fee back to the club. That does not sound like much, but it kept the lights on until Briatore, Ecclestone, and Mittal invested in the club a few months later.",113,2023-03-05

Glen Roeder,  Clive Allen, TerryFenwick,, Richard Langley, Simon Barker, Martin Rowlands, Paul Parker John Byrne and Clint Hill.  Eze and Adel were great. Les hit the ground running once he got back from Turkey. But my favourite was Ray Wilkins. Absolute Rolls Royce of a player. Made every single player around better just by being on the field.",72,2023-03-05
superhoops,"In no particular order, as a more post 2000s R, I have witnessed bits of magic at Loftus Road from Adel Tarrabt, Charlie Austin, Luke Freeman (yep, I said it), Eze, Ale Faurlin, Alex Smithies (yes, you read that right), and drum roll (literal drum roll from the Honey Thieves) Gareth Ainsworth (just for sheer work ethic and spirit). 

Now the depressing thing about a club like QPR in its current state is that when you see someone like Eze, a pure joy to watch, a player that was born to play football and makes it look so easy it's breathtaking, the caveat is you know he's going. We can't hold onto a player that good and they will go to a premier league outfit. 

So any knockout players you watch now will unfortunately be a fling, and not a lasting relationship. That's why you'd better appreciate your Ilyas Chair's, because they're just off being top, elite level players, and that means we can keep them. It shows how good Moroccos team was that he didn't play much at all in the World Cup and they still excelled.",188,2023-03-05

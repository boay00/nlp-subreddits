"In terms of skill and moments of magic, Taraabt and Faurlin. For pure workrate and commitment I will forever have a soft spot for Jamie Mackie.

"In no particular order, as a more post 2000s R, I have witnessed bits of magic at Loftus Road from Adel Tarrabt, Charlie Austin, Luke Freeman (yep, I said it), Eze, Ale Faurlin, Alex Smithies (yes, you read that right), and drum roll (literal drum roll from the Honey Thieves) Gareth Ainsworth (just for sheer work ethic and spirit). 

Now the depressing thing about a club like QPR in its current state is that when you see someone like Eze, a pure joy to watch, a player that was born to play football and makes it look so easy it's breathtaking, the caveat is you know he's going. We can't hold onto a player that good and they will go to a premier league outfit. 

So any knockout players you watch now will unfortunately be a fling, and not a lasting relationship. That's why you'd better appreciate your Ilyas Chair's, because they're just off being top, elite level players, and that means we can keep them. It shows how good Moroccos team was that he didn't play much at all in the World Cup and they still excelled.",2023-03-05

In that desperate hour the club sold one of our few assets, winger Lee Cook, to Fulham. Cookie was a long time fan of Rangers and donated his £250,000 signing-on fee back to the club. That does not sound like much, but it kept the lights on until Briatore, Ecclestone, and Mittal invested in the club a few months later.",2023-03-05

I actually think he'd be more suited as a right sided centre back of a back three. He's played there before and done better than right back.",2023-02-28

"Geezer is a bullshitter of the highest levels. But he's not the main reason we're in our current position. We have a DoF who allowed Beale to buy his players. He also bought players like bonne, dozzell, balogun, fucked off Barbet for Glass-salter the list goes on. The loans we've hired are atrocious. Roberts attitude and commitment is shocking. He can fuck off. Laird is scared of getting hurt, richards is.. no idea. Never seen the bloke. Tim Iroegbunam is a good player but not what we needed. His loan gives us zero benefit.

Removing Warburton was the mistake. Even with the bounce we got from beale. It was Willock fueled. When Willock was a player we could rely on. After he fell off a cliff form wise so did rangers.

Loaning Masterson whilst Dickie has been playing like this is shrewd. Even getting rid of Thomas a player who at least gives 100% would help the fight for survival. We need a miracle now chairs done his hamstring. Talking of which was is our sport science/fitness team doing as we've had so many muscle injuries.

"My realistic expectations is that this team has overachieved since Warbs took the helm. We had loanees who were looking for new clubs like Austin & Johansen, so they came on loan & gave themselves the chance to get a new club/contract. Once done, they relaxed into their normal modes & none more so than Austin, who seemed to fall of a cliff with form & goals. Coincidentally, that was the season that the team didn't progress & Warbs was no more.

Yes we went top with Beale, but the decline already started while he was still at the club & it hasn't changed since.

Now we supposedly take another teams manager, because we can't be any better than Rangers etc..., but what credentials does Gareth have in this division again? Getting relegated :(

I really hope I'm wrong, but going on past evidence, this looks like it will be a disastrous appointment, made in haste to subdue certain fans only.

Just once, I'd like to see them make hasty decisions about getting rid of the players who consistently fail to perform, pretty frequently.

I hope Gareth sticks with Wycombe, who have the best form over the last 5 games of any team in div 1 at the moment & they stuck with him, even when getting relegated, so clearly loyalty isn't something he thinks much of either, if he's talking to us now :(",2023-02-21

Does he have enough managerial experience at the Championship level to steady us out?",2023-02-20

I don't really blame NC for this, he proved at Blackpool he can manage at this level and I hope he inherits a better situation at his new club.

Sacking Warbs for Beale was the right decision if we wanted to progress, we were just unfortunate with how Beale played out. 

Honestly don't know where we go from here, 10 points off the bottom three and 2 games ahead of most down there. I'd of said Warnock but the ship has sailed there. Nothing left to do than maybe beg for Warbs back and hope we get 2021 rather than 2022 out of him.",2023-02-14
"I'm usually against changing manager mid season but it's clear Crichley ain't the man for this situation. Ain't all his fault though and these problems started under Beale.

My heart says Ainsworth, QPR man who's done an amazing job with no money at Wycombe.",2023-02-14
You can blame the players but the fact is they can’t be moved now. And if you heard Lee Hoos interview the other day he thinks this is the best squad in years. The only thing you can change is the manager. It has to be done or we’re going down.,2023-02-14
"I don't get it.

Year after year this bunch of players prove they aren't good enough for prolonged periods in a season, let alone a full season, but when things start going wrong, people come out & say sack the manager etc...

It's the players that are the problem & once again, it was proved with the lack of bids for any of them in the transfer window.

If Critchley really had '...zero motivational ability or tactical nous...' he wouldn't have been hired to start with.

I don't want us to go down, but in the long run, it might be a blessing in disguise. Hell, we might even win more games than we lose for once.",2023-02-14
"Whatever we do, we *must* stay up. If we go down, we’re fucked. It’s a long way back up from League One.

I find it hard to blame NC though. Stepped into a shit situation, given nothing to work with the in transfer window, and injuries across the board. With everyone fit and firing, our best team can contend in this league (evidenced by being top), but we don’t have the depth to handle any sort of adversity. A few injured, a few out of form, we’re fucked (as we can all currently see).

Overall we need an overhaul. We need more depth, we need strikers, we need players that aren’t injured all the time (where the fuck Balogun go?!) we need new directors and probably new owners as well. But whatever we need to do, we need to be doing it in the championship. I would be very concerned for our long term future if we left the Championship.",2023-02-14

"Critchley & his staff are on 3 1/2 year deals. So if he needs to go then let’s get the wallet out. Now that’s already bare from letting Bonne & Thomas go on Frees. 

However this about a motivational manager I don’t buy. Last night regularly I heard the turgid yells “get it forward” as QPR recycle the ball amongst the back live & midfield. The same play QPR have played since Warburton to Beale. That team can’t change something that is in their DNA. To those fans I would say that don’t understand finer points of the game as QPR way is to work the ball until space presents itself for quick incisive ball.

However with no Stef, Willock, & a midfield of Dozzell & Tim, this team just can’t play to that same standard. 

I don’t think sacking the manager is the right move. He needs time to pull this team around. 
The team is low on confidence and I don’t a sacking will give us the uplift. 

It’s time he puts his stamp on the team now. Then give him pre-season to build his own team in how he wants them to play. This team has gone through Warburton, Beale & needs a reset.  

With the finances of the club & state of the stadium, it’s time to stick to these choices.",2023-02-14

In terms of tips:

1. As of this season, I have always been able to find a stream. If you're having issues, maybe PM me (I should be available for about 50% of the games)

2. If you want news that isn't just dribble, go to the West London Sport website. You can follow their journalists on Twiiter too if that is your thing.

3. There are a few QPR podcasts, but I stick to ""Open all R's"" and West London Sport on YouTube.

4. Clive Whittacker has the best write ups in the business over at Loft For Words.

5. Enjoy the ride 🙂 In all sincerity, the community and vibe of this club is great. There are also some great users on this Reddit that are frequent and insightful.

"I've been a season ticket holder since 2003 and its been pretty shit supporting QPR for the most. However, on the odd occasion when we're actually good it is well worth the years of crap to experience winning the championship or a play off final win. Clive and Loftforwords is the best source for QPR imo. Also I'd recommended watching QPR videos on YouTube such as the play off final versus Derby or anything with Adel Taarabt in it. It's not easy supporting QPR but that's part of the fun. Ps Fuck Chelsea",2023-01-12
"I am from the US as well. Been following since they won the Championship in 2011. I never posted here, so thanks for giving me the opportunity. I have zero association to the team, but it is who I picked. 

I am a big NY Rangers hockey fan. I have to agree, the uniform/kits are really sharp looking and are one of my favorites throughout the football world. This keeper kits are really nice this year especially. I remember the US men's national team wore hoops a few years back.",2023-01-12
"First of all, from a fellow American, welcome home. I have told my crazy story about how I became a QPR supporter before, so I won't go into it again unless you want me to.

It is a tough team to support because they will break your heart. Like earlier this season, I was 100% convinced they were getting promoted. They were in a sweet spot on the table and everything was looking groovy. Just when I was all ready to be back in the Premiership it all went to hell.

This feels familiar to me because all the US teams I support are EXACTLY LIKE THIS. I don't know if you follow MLB, NFL, or NBA but if you do I am a Mets, Jets, and Knicks fan so you understand I understand frustration.

The club itself is really cool to their supporters, at least in my experience. It's why I root for QPR. I haven't been too active on this sub but whenever I do post I have felt welcome and nobody has given me trouble about being American lol.

I do recommend subscribing to QPR+ at least for the audio. It's not that expensive and you can follow all the matches. Because this club is in Championship, it's not very easy for us to see the matches on American television, so QPR+ is the way to go. Until they get promoted. You can watch every EPL match on Peacock. 

I can probably help guide you through some of the American side of English soccer if you have further questions.",2023-01-12
If you’re looking for a team to support then I’d suggest picking your most local team or a team that you have some genuine connection with. It’s much more fulfilling than a team you pick because you like the name or colours or badge.,2023-01-12

Only because it was relatively close to where we were staying, we went to The White Horse on Uxbridge Road before the match.  Not a fancy pub, but full of QPR supporters.

"Green Mountain Ranger (Vermont) checking in. Welcome.

If you really want to get a great sense of what it is like to be a QPR fan then I really recommend Clive Whittingham's [Loft for Words](https://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/) blog.

Clive gives a lovely introduction to the recent history of the club in a post from last week:

> If Queens Park Rangers is your team, then for much of the recent past you’ve been more baggage handler than football supporter. This is a club that comes with more strings attached than a Thunderbirds puppet. There have been multiple periods of extreme boom and bust, from rattling buckets to keep the boat afloat to a director’s box full of some of the world’s most notoriously rich people, often in the blink of an eye. There have been promotions, relegations, administrations and more than one death. There has been innovation, cunning and craft, precedents and standards set, records broken. And there has been rank incompetence, chronic mismanagement, and criminality. Titles have been clung to through FA hearings, diplomatic incidents have blown up with the Chinese, and guns have been brandished in boardrooms necessitating a weeklong trips out to Southwark Crown Court for ourselves. It is warmly referred to as a ‘spiv club’ by its former captain and lifelong fan Marc Bircham, and it’s impossible to shake the notion that it is “always up to something”.

In short, welcome, but be prepared to have the full football experience. This is not a club for the faint of heart that want to politely golf clap as the team lurches to a predictable finish. Strap in and get ready for the ride of your life.

(edit: spelling)",2021-08-16
"There is a documentary called The Four Year Plan (it’s on Amazon prime in the UK. You might be able to find it elsewhere) and basically talks about how they were on the verge of bankruptcy in 2007. As I live local-ish, you understand what they do for the community with the charity work they did for Grenfell Tower (in June 2017, a fire broke out in a 24-storey tower block) and more recently changing the stadium’s name from Loftus Road to Kiyan Prince Foundation (Kiyan Prince was a youth prospect at QPR and one day at school he was trying to spilt up friends having a fight at school, got in between them and one kid pull out a knife and stabbed him in the heart. So now Mark Prince, Kiyan’s dad, goes around educating youth on knife crime and it’s consequences as this is an ongoing problem in London). This is why I fell in love with the club. 

If you’re following QPR for the underdog glory, I think you have to understand how much gung-ho they were with their finances leaving them breaking finical fair-play and having to pay £42m but later a [settlement ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.com/sport/football/44980113.amp) was agreed as it was claimed unlawful. Since then we’ve been in the championship, trying to keep the ship afloat. Getting rid of the big names and focusing more on youth players and the youth academy (Eze being the greatest example. Recently sold to Crystal Palace for £16m + £4m add ons). Have to say QPR have managed to get a really good squad together (Charlie Austin, who the club adores, is a great example of the characters at our club. Recently rejoined us and taking a wage cut. Just watch [Highlights of his goals](https://youtu.be/o13A11FaSYw)) and found a manager, Mark Warburton, who we can rely on and he recently signed a new contract. The club has been very inconsistent with managers since being relegated years ago. So there is this buzz with the players we brought in and the system the manager has going that this year we have a great chance of going back up.",2021-08-16

"To make matters worse, Recast was unable to provide the stream and eventually the club tweeted that the match was on YouTube for free. 

My understanding is that the club could not include the Man U and Leicester friendlies due to “contractual obligations” that were beyond their control.

"I get what you mean. This is still very much a work in progress. For me, another top 10 finish represents stability and I wouldn't be unhappy with that. But the ambition has to be challenging for the playoffs.

Realistically, we're not challenging for automatic promotion. But a target to further close the gap to the top six doesn't seem outlandish.

There needs to be patience though. Something we're not exactly famed for.",2021-07-05
"I think top half is the floor for what I would call an acceptable season. I’m very much in the camp that doesn’t want to be promoted this year, just because the squad isn’t prepared for it. I think we only really have 5 players that would crack even a bad Premier League squad at all - Charlie, Ilias, Dickie, Seny and Lyndon. Even then I’m not convinced of any of them except Seny being Premier League quality.

If we somehow got promoted, it would probably lead to a scramble to add better players and we know how that went last time. We’d be the worst team in the Prem, I’m almost sure of that. 

To me, this season needs to be a consolidation year. Playoffs would be a remarkable year, 7-9 would be great, 10-12 would be satisfactory. Anything below a top half finish is a poor season imo.",2021-07-05
"Nah, it has to be playoffs if we sign Johansen. Too much money involved there",2021-07-05

"I’ve never been to London. I have no connection whatsoever. But I worked in a an Irish pub in NYC in 2009-11. We were always jammed with prem team supporters and Celtic supporters. I resented all of them because on game day I’d have to come in at 5am to get the place ready. Chelsea fans would show up at 7, still drunk from the night before and make my life a living hell. I despised them. 

But one, cold, snowy day on a random Wednesday. The place was empty and this guy came in asking to turn on Championship football. We wouldn’t normally turn on an obscure game but literally no one else was there so we obliged. He worked in the Empire State Building and we were across the street but he had taken the rest of the day off because QPR simply wasn’t televised and this was a rare occasion. 

I noticed the stadium was bizarre compared to most of the ones I knew well. I thought the team name was quirky too (New York Rangers being my first love, Queens Park Rangers was quite interesting). But what sold me was that this guy was just so nice. So thankful that he could take the day off and come sit for 90 mins and watch his team - which he hadn’t been able to watch in years it seemed like. 

After he left, I checked in on them periodically, hoping they did well for his sake. They got promoted to the prem at the end of that season and the next season I was suddenly watching every game. 

All my friends support giant EPL teams. To me it’s way more fun to support a club like QPR. You have to earn your glory.",2021-05-31
"This is a copy and paste job from what I wrote on a similar thread  on r/soccer a while back. Should give u a bit of a run down why I go for the Rs

I support QPR from down under. My connection with the club is a weird one as I’m the first to really support any football team and have no connection to the west London areas or the uk in general. But long story short they had similar colors to my Aussie Rules team their was a starting point. Upon further research and watching the odd game I feel in love with  the uniqueness and quirkiness of loftus road, the logo and the club in general, they even have quite the Aussie influence within West London area in which they play in. Seeing their work the work they do within the community also pleased me quite a bit. The Bobby Zamora goal is one of my favorites spirting moments of all time, not just because of the goal but the celebrations and the commentary are perfect. The way the club has handled itself with the BLM controversy about not kneeling , and the classiness they showed with their response also allowed me to see they had the same moral as I do, it can be seen that Les Ferdinand is installing a welcoming culture within the club but also one that says they will stand up for what they believe in. I know we are pretty rubbish at the best of times and promotion looks unlikely, but I can see I’ve chosen the right team for al the above factors.",2021-05-31
"Was indoctrinated by my Dad at first, but grew to love the team. Being an underdog always attracted me, I like the kit and I love the ground, despite how out of date it is. There aren't many stadiums where you are so close to pitch.

During the more recent Premier League years I fell out of love with the club as the players and managers we had were just there for the money and there was a sense that they just didn't care. In the last 5 or so years though, we've once again become the team we once were - caring about the community, getting players in that want to play for the club and being a team that's worth supporting again. 

As the other poster mentioned, Ferdinand and Hoos have really improved the club's general outlook, and everything the club has done with Kiyan Prince has been fantastic. Makes me feel proud to support the club. 

We're still not a club that'll bring a lot of success, but if that was all I cared about, I'd support one of those rubbish ESL teams.",2021-05-31
"I grew up in West London and so they’re my local club, also there’s a good relationship with QPR and Celtic who are a Scottish team due to a lot of Irish people living in Acton and Bush, as my dad is Irish and a fan of Celtic, he used to take me up QPR games on the 207 bus and we’d have a grand time.",2021-05-31
"I support QPR because my family have supported them from generation to generation dating back to the 1950s my great grandmother may have worked at the club at some stage but not 100% sure. It’s a big bonding experience for our family. It’s a club that was and still is to a point working class and inclusive we have fans from all kinds of backgrounds and ethnicities. The fanbase isn’t massive but it’s highly devoted. It’s very community driven too. A people’s club. Our involvement with the kiyan Prince foundation and Grenfell tower really shows this. 
Future plans are well keep the players we have and build on that but we are a selling club so it’s going to be difficult. One thing I really love about our club is the emphasis on producing our own players and bringing them through the academy to the first team. So it’s exciting at the moment because we could be seeing a new star player blossom in front of us next season we don’t know yet! We have a new training ground on the way after a lot of set backs which will help the club grow. In the far future hopefully a new stadium as much as i love loftus road we need to expand and to bring in more non-matchday revenue. Next season could be intresting for us, a play off push i think is possible but depends on what we do with recruitment.",2021-05-31
"My mum grew up near Loftus Road and my dad supported the club. They moved to Canada in the late 60s and my dad tried his best to follow the club.  For a long time, the best he could get was the odd score in the newspaper if QPR was playing a large club.  

As a kid in Canada, we really didn't the EPL until the mid 90s and we could only watch the top teams. My dad would still try to catch anything QPR but it was tough (still a lot of limited news over here). We would watch Manchester United matches mostly b/c those were the ones they showed and we loved Beckham's free kicks. It was how we bonded over football vs. just the world cup every 4 years.

As the years went on and the internet grew, we could finally focus more on QPR (although tough to watch). Youtube clips helped a lot and so much more news access.  

Sadly he passed away in 2011 so he never got to see the rise of the club to the EPL and fall and the playoff final and so on.  The club meant a lot to him and in turn, me as well.  I am so happy for the QPR Podcast as that is my major connection to the club and I can watch matches so much easier now with streams.  

One thing I will say about supporting QPR: it is never a dull day. There is always some sort of chaos going on which as a sports fan, it's great.",2021-05-31
"All my friends supported big 6 clubs. I live in Washington state. Needed a club to root for because I didn’t want to fall into the lull of rooting for someone like United. When QPR beat Chelsea in their first stint in the prem, I made sure to rub it in one of my friend’s face. Absolutely couldn’t stand Chelsea, which just made rooting for QPR more sweet. Then the heartbreak of Aguero scoring also was felt, I did not want to see a different friend satisfied with a city title. Fastforward a bit, didn’t follow the team much until I saw on Twitter that they were in the playoff final (and I was still in high school, so didn’t necessarily have the time or ability). The playoff final happened to also fall on a day I was hanging out with my prom date, who I was so smitten with. I woke up at 7 am, found an illegal stream for the game, and I was hooked. Tears were had when O’Neil was sent off. Gasps were had for some of the insane saves made by Green. And oh my god, once Bobby put that goal in the back of the net, the whole house was awake. I had never been more thrilled in my life. That’s when I was 100% QPR. May 24, 2014 ended up being the best day of my life, and it’s not even close. Followed them closely for the abysmal 14–15 campaign. But was in love with the team. Also a lot of picking QPR in fifa 15. Vargas was incredible. The thing that made QPR most special, was that I had never met another fan in person. I have seen one guy, in Vegas 2019, with a QPR shirt on, and straight up ran up and hugged the dude. But it makes rooting for the team even more special. Can’t wait for the day when I make it across the pond and see my team play. Can’t wait to meet some of the regulars I’ve interacted with on Twitter. It’s more than a team. It’s a family. And holy shit I love my QPR family.",2021-05-31

"I honestly don’t think most people could explain what it is about QPR they love. They’re consistently ‘bang average’. A severely outdated stadium but one that still carries an unmatched atmosphere on a cold tuesday night in January. A toxic (not everybody) fanbase in terms of running their own players out of the club and a merry-go-round of managers who aren’t good enough but that looks like it may have stopped for a while.

If actually going to games is an option for you, I would suggest just that. Go to a game, sit as close to Block R as you can get, and see for yourself why people love QPR",2021-05-31
"Like a few other commenters, I was indoctrinated by my father, who grew up watching them in their glory days of the 1970s. They fell off massively and have managed to enter a massive financial slump and a revolving door of talented players. We left the UK when I was small to live in the USA and I watched their games with my father every chance we had as a sort of bonding ritual, with my most clear memories starting with that promotion season ten years ago now. 

You never know what you're going to get, and can only hope for a positive performance instead of the rather spoiled, narrow-minded expectation to win that you get from most fans of the top clubs these days. Every game is a journey through every conceivable emotion known to man, and this is only what I gathered from watching streams from another continent. When I was 16, I finally got to Loftus Road with my father and saw a thoroughly disappointing and crushing defeat to Hull on Boxing Day after the R's had had the lead. Luckily we also had tickets for one match later: the 6-1 win against Cardiff City (biggest home win for a decade or something), a team in a similar position that had no expectation to be as completely played off of the park as they were. To be in such a unique environment with other QPR fans after a short lifetime of having to explain to American fans of the new ""Big 6"" who QPR were brings me almost to tears of joy just from the memory. Of course, some of the fans are toxic and some isolated players and backroomers a bit rotten behind the scenes, but at its core QPR is a tight-knit, family and community club with a wonderful history and, if nothing else, exciting and unpredictable football that persists to this day.",2021-05-31
"Mine is a pretty odd reason to support them. It actually started because of fifa.... was choosing random teams to do a career mode with. Really liked their jerseys so decided to run with them. Then later on in the year I tuned into the playoff final and found myself rooting for them. Then that Bobby Zamora goal happened and holy shit was I jacked to the titts. I was finally able to catch a lot more games on tv since I live in the states. I’ve been keeping tabs on them ever since. Then last year I was sent to England on a work trip but unfortunately I was staying in derby the entire time, literally walking distance from their stadium. None of my colleagues wanted to join me so I decided to take the 2 to 3 hour trip down to London to catch a QPR game. I got a few of the recommended pubs before the match and enjoyed the atmosphere but the best part was the walk into the stadium... I thought it was amazing how you seem to walk through a neighborhood then right out of no where the stadium appears. The atmosphere was something else. All my life I had dreamed of going to a match where the fans chant and sing songs and I got exactly that during the match. I was rubbing shoulders with the dude next to me but that didn’t bother me much haha. I watched us come back from down 2-0 against stoke and all the banter that came with it it was great. The cherry on top was watching Eze effortlessly glide through the pitch. He’s an unbelievable player man. But yeah that’s just my story on how I’m a lifelong qpr fan",2021-05-31
"I got into rangers at university. I was in digs three roads away from Loftus Road. I heard a roar on a Saturday and asked a flat mate what it was. He took me down to see the stadium and I was hooked. It was during the era of Paul Parker, Roy (Smegley) Wegley and Sir Les.",2021-05-31

With everything we’ve done with Kiyan Prince we are so often reminded that we are a special club. The inclusivity of QPR has been felt when interacting with R’s supporters near and far. 

It also should be mentioned that Adel Taarabt on his day was single handedly one of the most entertaining players I’ve ever seen. Never had so much fun watching football than when Adel stepped on the pitch and there was that possibility he would put on a show. 💙🤍",2021-05-31

"Not sure, but some people think that Bonne may be headed off in the summer. Nothing concrete or official, but wouldn't surprise me. He's done decent, but not great, and would rather have Kelman play over him. Don't need three senior strikers if we only play one of them a game",2021-04-13

He's starting tonight so I think you were spot on mate,2021-04-13
"I think if we bring in Austin permanently then we could see either Bonne or Kelman (who I think is more likely) go out on loan next season.
Reason behind Kelman being more likely. He is seen as a long term project player, so wouldn't be surprised for him to go out on loan to a league 1 team next year. Similarly to how Masterson was shipped out earlier this year (although unfortunate with the injury), would be good for development to be playing week in, week out, something I don't think he will get next season if Austin is made permanent (which I think is definitely Plan A).",2021-04-13
Kelman and Bonne are both not good enough for this level. However kelman will be with time/experience. He’s like 5 years younger than bonne so I think it’s much better he’s being preferred by warbs,2021-04-13
"Kelman is one for the future still, if he comes good it will probably be two years from now.  Wouldn't be surprised to see him go out on loan again next year.

Bonne still has a place in the team for me but his lack of playing time over the last few games is concerning.  His finishing has been poor but the other aspects of his game are in line with what I'd expect from a player in the Championship.",2021-04-13

Anything above 12th would exceed my expectations. 12-16 would meet my expectations given how may of last years goal scorers are gone.,2021-02-19
Staying up I'd take in a heartbeat considering the players we lost and how the first half of the season went.,2021-02-19
"I'd say finishing above 18th is a success given our budget and resources. I judge us more by is our football fun to watch, are we developing our young players and are we improving aspects of our football than where we finish in the league atm. So far the defending is better than last year and we look less naive as a team",2021-02-19
top half of the table would be satisfactory. Top ten would be outstanding.,2021-02-19
"You have to give it up for the gaffer. There were a lot of fans calling for his head in December, so it is only fair to recognize that he absolutely has the Rs rolling now. Especially [considering this](https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2020/january/opposition-view-qpr/):

>It was recently reported that QPR now have the fifth lowest wage bill in the Championship so the mid-table League position is a good achievement so far. Players’ salaries at Loftus Road have been dramatically reduced by 70% during the past four years.",2021-02-18
He deserves it. His management style is really shining now that we have a reliable goalscorer. The best manager in the world can only do so much when a team’s finishing is as poor as ours was in the first half of this season.,2021-02-18
"I remember seeing some tweets thrown at Lumley that were disgusting, not just that but the fact people were @ him just to make sure he sees it. You ain’t a supporter if you start doing that.",2021-02-12
It is a fan's right to complain.,2021-02-12
It's nice to hear from a QPR player that we are a club that's enjoyable. It's been a tough half decade for the club and hopefully guys like Charlie can help change the mood/ outlook moving forward.,2021-02-10
Omg my heart,2021-02-10
"You got it boss. Just completed.

Commercial activity for smaller clubs is certainly an interesting topic of discussion. I’ll freely admit that it’s harder for me to stay in tune with the finances of the club as a fan who lives thousands of miles away. Since I can’t go to matches, I try to financially support the club in other ways - through merchandising, paying to watch game streams, etc. I think not having the reliable television money of the Premier League combined with the fact that Championship fan bases tend to be smaller is a double edged sword. It’s a lot more difficult for the club to achieve sustainable success - yet fan engagement tends to be very high because we feel that our dollar—er, pound?—actually means something to the club. Even as an international fan, I feel the level of access QPR provides to fans is much higher than a big club - and certainly higher than any major professional sports club in America.

We’ve seen the consequences of financial overreach firsthand over the past few years. I’ll never be 100% comfortable with aggressive monetization of sport, but as long as ticket prices remain reasonable, I’ll support the club in whatever it needs to do to remain financially sound. When we make it back to the Premier League - and we will, one day - I don’t want to spend the entire season fearing the financial consequences of relegation.",2021-02-08
Done.,2021-02-08
QPR is where it all seems to fall into place for Charlie. We love him and I'm pretty sure he loves us. I doubt whether he is going to get any massive offers from elsewhere and he'd be a fool to ditch QPR for a few extra grand. He is back where he belongs.,2021-02-07
"He recently appeared on 5 Live's 72+ show and was talking about the latter years of his career. He essentially said he's in a place in his life where he doesn't want to uproot his family and move, so unless he got an unbelievable offer, I think he'd stay around the London/South East region.

Only real alternative to QPR would be perhaps Reading, given where he lives.

If we offered him a two year deal at £15k a week, with an option to extend, plus captaincy, I think he snaps it up.",2021-02-07
"So long as it fits within our budget we should definitely snap him up on a deal.  Further to your point, we haven't owned a natural finisher since Charlie left in 2016.",2021-02-07
Depends on how the rest of his loan plays out and what his wage demands are.,2021-02-07
I can't see how the club can afford to sign him unless he's willing to sign on FAR lower wages than he's been on for years,2021-02-07
"Money will be a factor (not shocking) but depending how the rest of the season goes, I could see it but ideally it would be a year to year thing. I wouldn't want to lock him up for a 2-3 year contract to only have that blow up (injuries should be a concern).

That said, he seems like a great fit with the young guys and does understand his role.",2021-02-07
Was saying to my brother at about 50 min that I would take 0-0. I was thinking it at 30min to be honest!,2021-02-06
We are flying!,2021-02-06
4 wins out of 5 absolutely brilliant and the last 2 against 2 of the top 8,2021-02-06
Mine too! So happy he could join us for at least the rest of this season. Now I’m gonna make sure I enjoy and appreciate every second of it.,2021-02-02
"The whole team’s energy changed when he returned. The playmakers can feel confident someone will finish the chances they create, and it’s clear Charlie is having fun and enjoying significant playing time at a club where he’s appreciated. I’m so glad he’s back, and I hope whenever he departs again, the club does a proper job finding a striker in his style to replace him.

A great finisher is the difference between a relegation fight and a playoff push in this league. It’s too late and the overall team is too poor to consider anything ambitious this season, but it’s an encouraging step in the right direction.",2021-02-02
"Couldn't believe I saw some people questioning the signing when he returned. 

Honestly can say I'm prouder of QPR last night - winning with Charlie and Uncle Albert scoring to put us just 17th!! - than of any result we got last time we were in the prem. 

Rangers lads that bleed blue and white. Bollocks to all those mercenaries. We feel like a proper club again.",2021-02-02
He definitely has that strikers instinct.  From what I've seen so far he moves fairly well.,2021-02-02
"I often see comments about him being slow / broken.  I haven't been able to watch a full match since his return to the club.  Is he he really that bad (speed/health wise) or is it just ""he's older so he must be broken""?",2021-02-02
"Been a fan since we were promoted the first time with Adel and that lot, and he’s definitely my favourite player. 

Mates of mine who are friends of big clubs ask me (from Australia with no real tie to the club from a parent or even friends) what it’s like to follow smaller clubs, because it’s not like we’re contending for championships any time soon. I just tell them that we end up latching onto moments and players that are meaningful to us. The Derby game at Wembley, for one. Beating Chelsea in 2013. 

Charlie is one of those players that means something to the fans of this club, and the club seems to mean something to him. Love having him back, even for a little bit. It reminds me of when Thierry Henry went to Arsenal on loan while he was with NY Red Bulls. Obviously Charlie isn’t Henry, but he brings up the same meaning to me.",2021-02-02
"[Sam Field](https://www.qpr.co.uk/news/club-news/field-i-am-absolutely-delighted-020221/):  “I once spent 20 minutes talking with Chaz about football and it changed my whole outlook. He probably doesn’t even realise that.” 

Football is a game ridiculously heavy on rhetoric, but you still don't read something like that very often.",2021-02-02

"Are you a fener fan?

He's a winger that can beat a man and has a frame where he is tough to win the ball from. In terms of output, he's decent but won't rake up a huge amount of goals/assists. Seemed to play a lot better for us when he wasn't the ""main man"" with Eze/Wells around him.

For virtually free though, still a good low risk signing for Fenerbache as he's English he will always have sell on value.",2021-01-24

"Lol that of all the hosts of the QPR Pod you pick Finney. No beef with Finney, I find him a larrikin.

To answer your question, when I think of Derby, I think of the dominant side in our promotion run. Feels like you have had a few good seasons that have teased promotion, and now you're a bit cold.",2021-01-21
"I think its pretty poor of BOS not to sign a one year extension so we can get a fee for him given how patient we were with him when he wasn't deliverying the goods.

I don't understand why he rejected Club Brugge's offer in the summer but agreed to go to Fener now? Fenerbahc have been a mess of a club for years now, usuaully prefering to sign old past it players on big wages than developing good young players.",2021-01-16
"Heard we are getting just under a million for a fee.  Both him and Manning have gone for a pittance, really is a shame.

Not sure what the draw is for Bright in Turkey.  Good luck to him.",2021-01-16
"Very pacy, had half a season of adding goals and end product to this attribute but he blows hot and cold. I think he's a good player at this level, not sure if he's good enough for the step up to the Super Lig but I guess we'll see!",2021-01-15
"He is a winger with great pace and strength, he runs with the ball and shields it very well.

What he lacks is consistency with crossing and finishing. He is a patchy player who looks like a great player one week but like he has no ability or confidence the next.

He is young and has great potential but he hasn’t shown enough to prove he is a European level player yet for me. Could become one though with the right coaching. You will be able to get him cheap and I believe it probably is worth it for you to sign him.",2021-01-15
"Bummer, but gives us some time to integrate our new players.",2021-01-15
Looks like a done deal. Loan with an option for a permanent.,2021-01-09

"I used to absolutely bloody love the FA Cup. I remember Spurs' Jurgen Klinsmann once saying that the English love the Cup more than the league. He was not wrong. And a good Cup run was a nice little financial bonus for a club too. But since the advent of the Premier League and the so-called Champions League (apparently named by Oceania's ""Ministry of Truth"") and associated riches, the venerable FA Cup, the World's oldest competition, is now just a place for blooding youngsters and giving your fringe players and reserve keeper a bit of match practice. Very sad. And, for me anyway, it doesn't even diminish the pain of QPR's record in the competition over the last 3 decades probably being 92nd out of 92. Even the odd win in recent years never looked like turning into a Cup run. As usual two weakened teams will be striving for an early exit so that they can concentrate on the league, no doubt both thankful to have avoided the minnows in the draw and associated embarrassment with a loss. QPR will surely win the battle to lose. Can we call that a win?

"Solid start, good luck with it",2021-01-05
"Unless BOS goes then I don't think so. Giving him a full season under his belt is best for him, not to bring him back from loan only for him to watch Carroll out on the wing instead of him and be limited to 20 minute cameos",2021-01-03
No harm in it,2021-01-03
Him and Smyth should come back in my opinion.  There have been several instances where I felt like more options on the wings would've improved our situation.,2021-01-03

"I feel like slowly but surely their are bright spots within what we are doing atm, while it may not always transfer to the scoreboard we’ve quite a lot of positives going on rn. We sold eze for 16 mil ish with a sell on fee so that’s great business right their and their saying we got him for nothing originally , our signings have been solid this season, uncs on a free is a steal, boones saved us twice this season at the death and dykes and dickie have played their roles. Above that the clubs doing great worth within the community especially around BLM. I think overall the club is just being much more cautious than they were in the prem years which is probs not a bad things sometimes.",2020-11-07
"So happy to have him at the club, been too long since we've had a boyhood Rangers fan wearing those hoops",2020-11-05
There's a paywall for most of the article,2020-11-05
"My inexpert take is that the defenders are far too focused on preventing shots at any cost. I don’t know if that’s coaching, or some form of mild PTSD from playing in front of keepers they did not trust all least season. I personally notice myself adjusting the way I play when I’m in front of a keeper who doesn’t make routine saves. 

In my opinion, they should dial back the aggressive tackling just half a notch. Let Dieng do his job. Honestly, I really like what I see in the young keeper. I can see why Doncaster supporters were raving about him. His command of the box is excellent, and he was really unlucky on the second pen yesterday. 

I don’t think we are up in danger of going up, but I think the team is better than what they’ve shown over the first part of the season.",2020-11-01
"I think its sheer panic in the penalty box. This is a stretch, but it may perpetuated through the lack of confidence in our keeping?

Clearly it is an area that needs work and one which cannot go unnoticed by the Bread Man.",2020-11-01
Cant account for utter stupidity. Last two was both very avoidable. I even think barbet was lucky not to be red carded. Even Dickie pen was because barbet slide in to try and cut the ball out. Screams of poor positioning but also a lack of shielding in the midfield. Both the pen vs Barnsley and first versus Cardiff were balls played through the middle of our team. So the midfield have something to be accountable for.,2020-11-01
"I'd agree with all of those points. Adomah has been good and gives a nice option down the right when he is at full fitness, he seems to pair well with Kakay as well...

It really shows how much the players depended on Eze's creativity and dribbling to break down a defense, they have really struggled to find a way through in the final third, hopefully Uncle Albert can provide that.",2020-10-27
"Keep the faith.

I think we'll turn it around, like /u/Deadend_Friend said, we've been competitive in most games and have actually managed to keep a few clean sheets.

I might've been too harsh on the team today as well.  Once you are down to 10 it is a bit difficult to look a good team.  We actually looked decent prior to the red.

Also, don't worry, we have another in four days to look forward to.",2020-10-27
After all the signings during the window I thought we were going to be competitive and have an outside shot at moving up. It’s heart breaking to see a lack of goals.,2020-10-27
"I think we're just having our slump early this season, will get better. Still trust in Warburton",2020-10-27
"Calm down pal, its only been 8 games, all but 2 of which we've been competetive in and could have won. Got a bunch of new players with plenty of time for them to come good. It's not an amazing start but its been far from disasterous too, keep the faith. COYR'S!",2020-10-27
"You’ve got to think we’ll be alright, mostly due to how bad other teams are, than our quality.

We’ve been good defensively in quite a few games, we’ll be alright",2020-10-27
"Tbh at the moment im just hoping we survive relegation this season, without Eze we’ve looked hopeless at times, no creativity whatsoever",2020-10-27
"This was always going to be a difficult season. With Eze, Hugill and Wells no longer here, we've lost approx. 50 goals.

Making up that deficit, while trying to tighten the back, is a monumental task.

My biggest concern is Chair. It's just not happening for him at the moment. He doesn't seem to be the creative answer. And this is probably the biggest problem for Warbs to figure out.

2008-09 we scored 42 goals, our lowest in the 'Championship' era. I think we get fewer than that, this year.",2020-10-27
I wish I was as positive as everyone else.  I don’t see the future looking good with this team.,2020-10-27
If you sack the manager mid-season is just repeating the same pattern that the club is now known for. If the end of season results are terrible (we can debate on what that means) but then you move on.,2020-10-27
"Had the opportunity to get the club money for him and play in the Champions League but he turned that down, strung us along that he might sign a contract in order to get minutes on the pitch and then once the window was shut rejected the deal. Rat.",2020-10-27
"Unpopular opinion, but I think he's way overrated.  He's got skill and physical ability, but he just isn't direct and aggressive enough to play as a forward.",2020-10-27
"I really do not understand why this was handled differently from Ryan Manning.

BOS has developed so well over his time at QPR-- if he keeps progressing he will have top Championship or lower Premiership teams looking for his services.",2020-10-27
I don't understand why the club is handling these situations this way.  It seems obvious to me that we get Brighty playing hard until January and try to off-load him then.  Otherwise we are only ensuring we get nothing for him in the off-season...,2020-10-27

"I haven’t played ‘21 yet, is Billy Gilmour an option?",2020-09-28
"Foden on loan, ejaria?",2020-09-28
"We can't realistically afford anyone to actually replace him, as he was so much better than the rest of the team! We're being very stingy with money at the moment, so bargain signings and loans are the way to go. I don't think many players are on more than 10-15k either, and they are the high earners. Chair is definitely promising though he's not going to win games on his own like Eze could.

We need a new LB as Manning is looking to leave, though if he does stay he's more than good enough. New CB and RB are probably needed. We've just signed a CB, but he doesn't look that great so far. Kakay at RB is young and promising, but a bit raw. Kane, who he's replaced could be sold.

Midfield wise we're not too bad, though need a winger I reckon. Put Chair in the hole and then sign someone who can whip some crosses into Dykes, or someone more creative who can link up with Chair.

I personally don't rate Amos, who we've just signed, but he'll probably do alright for you in deeper midfield alongside Cameron, who you'll need to sign a replacement for pretty soon!

Oh and although you could sign a keeper I'm not sure it'd be realistic as we have two vying for Number 1 (both in poor form) and we started a young lad in our last game (league too, not cup).",2020-09-28

Lots of financial mismanagement from 2011 through 2015 that has followed us for a long time. We have had to aggressively decrease the wage bill to the point that we have one of the lower wage paid teams in the championship, so we are actually punching above our weight right now.

To stay somewhat competitive, QPR has been doing a combination of the following:

* scouring the country for players who have been discarded from other clubs like BOS and Eze
* taking on solid if unspectacular older players like Cameron and Wallace 
* promoting players from our own youth team like Darnell Furlong and Kakay
* in recent years, we have also got strikers on loan who were too expensive to buy like Nahki and Hugill, but it seems we do not have enough money to pay for wages of players like that

If you compare this strategy to what teams in the top 6 of the championship are doing, it is very clear we are at a competitive disadvantage. I think continuing to stay financially solvent while fielding a team that can finish 10th-18th is sadly the goal for the short and medium term. To prepare for a return to the premier league, the team likely needs a new training ground, stadium, etc. I personally prefer the championship, but I also want us to get promoted every year. Supporting this club is a strange affliction.",2020-09-26
"If you look at our history, we were always best being a club developing youth and lesser known players from smaller clubs into big stars and moving them on (Les Ferdinand, Trevor Sinclair, Andy Impy etc) and using the cash to buy new youngsters to replace them.

We tried spending the big money on players who'd played for bigger clubs but had nothing to prove, many just saw us as a place to get a big paycheque at the end of their career, they weren't hungry and wanting to play for our club really. Since our last relegation (which was less because of spending on old players and more just spending on the wrong players) club legend Les Ferdinand is trying to turn us back into what we were in our 80s and 90s heyday but till will take a long time given the clubs finances being small, but we're slowly moving in the right direction.",2020-09-26
"QPR in the 60s-90s were amazing.  And even in the 90's and 00s we had some wonderful games, but we had decades of being the papers more for off the field news than on the field.

Find a way to watch ""The Four Year Plan"". It's only a short part of our history but the documentary picked a team to follow during an amazing period.",2020-09-26
[deleted],2020-09-26
"Financial management.  Chasing a pipe dream of EPL glory by signing overpriced past their prime star players.  We are on a much better path now.  I think we're in for years of grinding out mid tables in the Championship, but as the books get balanced and the ffp fine is in our past, our stature as a large club in London with wealthy owners, and our new found financial management, can get us promoted and established in the Prem.",2020-09-26
"I’m a fairly new fan too, but it seems to me like the clubs finances are in shambles. Not as bad as some other teams who are threatening to fold, but still in rough shape.",2020-09-26
"Been a fan since the mid/late 90s. Probably fair to say we occupied a position similar to that that Burnley or Southampton do now.

Overall I think most of what's gone wrong in the intervening years has been a result of acting like we just 'deserve' to be in the top division, rather than earning it. Half the Football League could claim they 'deserve' to be in the top flight, but the truth is no one does by right.

Might be an unpopular opinion, but I think we've been relatively fortunate over FFP - no points deductions, no relegations, forced to operate sustainably, and to me it feels like we're emerging as a better club. I can see us being serious contenders in 5-10 years, and I think we'll be far better-placed to stay up, so it'll be completely worth it.",2020-09-26
"Harry redknapp happened - see west ham, Portsmouth etc

Oh and rangers pre prem had always been the best paying club in London 

A better training ground is the first step -as that's the players main office - stadium is a really fine until rangers go stellar again",2020-09-26

100% absolutely we'll need cover at left back.  Maybe a CB on loan who can do it.,2020-09-13
"No.  Wallace and Niko are good enough.  I'd rather see more depth at center back, midfielder, & striker.",2020-09-13

I found him to be average in our playoff winning season but assume he's on low wages and is a competent passer of the ball. Maybe he'll work better under Breadman than he did under 'Arry. Was highly rated once upon a time so maybe he's a late bloomer and Breadman can help fulfill his potential,2020-09-04

Great signing at a position of need.  Just need one more striker and center back I think.,2020-09-04

Personally not a fan of Carroll. He's been overhyped and doesn't really control games how wed need him to.. always plays the safe pass too. We're going to need a more forward thinking player this year with Eze gone. If we hadn't signed Amos then I'd give Carroll a go.,2020-09-01

I hope more time is invested in the first two options than the loan market. Can't be having a rollercoaster of emotions like I have with Hugill and Wells.,2020-08-28
Ok but let's take a couple million and get a defender though.,2020-08-28
"It’s really hard to compare him to many other players purely cos I’ve never seen anyone else stop time like he does on the pitch. 

He glides with the ball, and makes people look stupid a lot, is fast but is so effortless with it that he doesn’t look like he can burn people. But still does that. 

I need to stop talking before I upset myself any more tbh.",2020-08-27
"as a defender facing him in any given position on the pitch, you would genuinely not know whether he's going to run at you, shoot from distance, tee someone up, or literally anything else.

it's like he's playing a very slightly different, more chaotic type of game to everybody else, but to him it makes total sense and his decisions are invariably very good.

even though in the PL he'll get more regularly closed down, knocked about, and overall not have the same fear factor as in the EFL, he will usually be the best player to watch throughout a game.

For me, losing him is like when Bowie died - it's sad, but we were so lucky to have him when we did.",2020-08-27
"A well rounded attacking midfield who contributes to them team in every possible way.  He can dribble, pass, score from distance.  He's agile, strong, and intelligent.  Incredible player.",2020-08-27
"I see a bit of a similarity between him and Alphonso Davies tbh. Though as a QPR and Canadian/Whitecaps fan, those are easily the two most exciting players I've watched over the past few seasons, so take it with a grain of salt. They both have incredible speed, great spacial awareness off the ball, and always seem to find room. Also, both can get an accurate shot off incredibly quickly. Obviously fonzie is in a league of his own, but again, lots of similarities imo.",2020-08-27

I like the color better than last years or the dreaded pink,2020-08-20
"So we're definitely still not poor, just struggling with the FFP fine still! Still the largest fine in all of world football I believe? On little old QPR...",2020-08-20
"The FFP restrictions don’t necessarily reflect the fact that we don’t have money, just that we were massively overspending in a way that made the club potentially financially unstable if it continued. As much as it hurt the club, the FFP very well could’ve saved the club.

The club had $53m Net Credit in 2019. We have plenty of money. The club just doesn’t have a huge Revenue compared to expenses - partially because of a smaller stadium, partially because we haven’t had any huge sales in recent years. Selling Eze will do ya nicely.",2020-08-20
Not necessarily the case we have money can be shareholders not wanting to sell shares and have less of a say in things.,2020-08-20
"You also have to remember that this is a club that (pre-COVID), loses £10 million a season just by opening the stadium to supporters. That’s before wages, transfer fees, etc. 

Makes it hard to admit that leaving Loftus Road is what will make the club stop haemorrhaging money every year, but at least the foundations are there now it’s being run less like a plaything.",2020-08-20
"Decent chunk of change, approx 2m. Bit of a roll of the dice given his history in lower leagues, but then again the guy has scored 140 (actually 86...I have fat fingers)  goals in 181 games.",2020-08-19
"Good replacement for Hugill, hope we get a smaller faster striker to partner him and properly replace Wells.",2020-08-19

 Dykes is also relishing the physicality of the English Championship, adding: “That’s not a worry for me!

“I like that side of the game sometimes – I’m willing to get in there and rough some people up!”",2020-08-19
"The last time we actually outright bought a striker was big Matt Smith, for £1m, in January 2017.

I know very little about this guy, apart from what's been written and said elsewhere. But it sounds like pragmatic investment.

I'd expect a loaning of another striker to either play alongside or as an alternative, to give a bit of squad depth. Perhaps someone more accustomed to this level already.",2020-08-19

"Glad we kept Christ Ramsey on in the club, I really like the cut of his jib.",2020-08-19
I thought he was okay last season but nothing incredible but he's young and has potential it keeps some squad continuity from last season and Breadman seems to like him so I'm happy enough assuming the fee wasn't too high (anyone know what we paid for him?),2020-08-17
"He likes the squad, has made friends within the team and as others have said has come back from a knee explosion. 

Think that we can judge how good he is after another full season under his belt tbh, you have to remember last year was his first full season ever at this level so you’d expect him to kick on now. And if he doesn’t then the fee won’t have killed the finances. 

Remember where Eze, BOS, and Chair were after they’d made less than 50 starts, I’m prepared to back him and see what kind of player he is after he’s made 150 appearances.",2020-08-17
I'm happy to see this. I didn't like him at first but since Warburton's played him in a slightly more aggressive position he's really come into his own. Definitely a lot of potential in him.,2020-08-17
Leistner will be happy then!,2020-08-11
"Because people don’t understand the work that’s been put in to cut the wage bill from 80m a year to under 20m a year. They think that QPR should be buying everyone who’s on the market when players like Assombalonga command fees of over £10m. 

They also don’t seem to remember that three of the better players in midfield from last season (Freeman, Mass, The Rat [Scowen]) have also gone. 

Warburton has essentially worked miracles without spending a thing. Finishing 13th while being carried by a 20-something year old Eze for a season is no mean feat. If there’s a way to properly invest the money made from BOS, Eze and Manning then it’s because of the work Ferdinand and Hoos have done over the past couple of seasons. There are a dozen clubs who are more fucked financially than QPR this summer, which is why they were able to battle for Kieffer Moore (remember paying money for an actual striker?)

Will be interesting to see what happens this summer, but the leg up from this season’s success is a sure fire way to a good start tbh.",2020-08-08

"The longer structural answers to this are excellent, so I'll just add something characteristically throwaway:

They're angry that the long-term sustainability of the club is being treated like it matters.",2020-08-08
Curious what makes you think there is so much hate towards them?,2020-08-08
My biggest criticism of them in the past is they've not given previous managers enough time (especially Holloway who was doing a good job) but they seem to be addressing that with Warburton. I'd also argue they've sold our best players for too cheap in the past but considering how the club was ran when they took over they've done well in getting QPR back to what it should be.,2020-08-08

I hope we take a look at Tom Carroll as a midfield option as well.  Free agent and only 27.  Has had injury problems but from what I've heard he has a great attitude, trains well, and could fit into Warburton's playstyle.",2020-07-27
"One of those players who went to a Premier League club and just fell off the radar. Still young enough to be hungry and this is a low risk move imho. Captained Leicester’s u23 team which isn’t bad and can play across the front three, feels like a shrewd bit of business",2020-07-27

"I wonder sometimes, what are the odds that Eze might actually want to stay at QPR?

People forget but when Millwall released him years ago, other clubs he trialed with rejected him too.  He said he almost hung up his boots, until QPR called.

If he sees QPR as having saved his career, that could be quite a motivator to stay.  If we sell BOS, Manning... maybe we free up enough funds to actually resign with QPR.  I understand we have a strict wage structure, but Eze is a once in a decade player, and I can think of no other player who has earned it more than he has.  Get another crack to thrive and grow in the Championship before moving the Premier League.

Honestly, I am biased, and this is unlikely, but after watching video after video of mental highlights Eze is a real gem and it would be nothing short of unbelievable to watch him play with us for a few more years.",2020-07-26

Eh I think Kelly is decent enough? Just has an awful defence in front of him. He's not the worst keeper we've had,2020-06-27
"I think GK should really be less of a priority than some of the other more pressing needs.  As others have said, I think Kelly is a decent enough Championship starter provided the defense is strengthened.  I've also read a lot of good things about Seny Dieng, on loan right now at Doncaster.  If you can get a quality option for free obviously you'd consider it, but I don't think it's too big of a concern going into next season.",2020-06-27
"I love these types of threads, thanks for the contribution.

The financial position of our club means we lose a lot of players we should otherwise have kept to push on.  The likes of Smithies, Luongo, Freeman, Furlong, and now Hall just to name a few.  It also means we can't afford to sign players like Nahki Wells.  Frankly, it is depressing.  I remember in the 90s Francis said he'd leave the club if we started selling our stars.  Now we are a selling club..  I worry about our ambitions.

On the other hand, Hoos has straightened out, financially, a few clubs before us who are all in the Premier League now.  In the last decade we've managed to reduce our wage bill substantially and in the process become somewhat financially sustainable.  Important to look at both sides of the coin I suppose.

As far as LB goes, I disagree that Manning has been defensively poor this year.  Arguably I think he has been one of our top three players this season, behind Eze and Bright.  I really don't see us bringing in another LB unless Manning is sold in the window.  His contract is up at the end of next season, he is surely a saleable asset, and it is unlikely our finances will allow him to resign.  This means that we could lose him along with Eze and Bright this transfer window.  Better we sell them though than get nothing, but the lack of continuity will make next season that much more difficult.

At RB we have Rangel along with Kakay and Kane.  Rangel's age means his time in the team is limited.  I don't see either LB/RB as big a priority as CB.  Losing Hall is definitely a blow to the team.  From what I've seen of Masterson he could have a regular place in the team, but he is young.  Barbet has been inconsistent this year, but has shown flashes of ability that leave me feeling hopeful.  It is the depth that is the problem, woefully so.  Bringing in another CB on a deal, and potentially another on loan, must be a priority.

CM is another area where a signing will be a priority.  Ball and Cameron can do a job, but we need more quality and youth.

Striker is the last position that I would say is an absolute priority.  Thankfully, with transfer money incoming from the sale of Eze (and maybe others) we may finally be able to invest in some quality players.

Mostly I agree with you, just trimmed out LB and RB from the list of priorities which will hopefully add more focus to our transfer window.

Potential candidates (all contract expiring end of season): 

CB: Ryan Shotton, Jake Cooper, Shaun Hutchinson.

CM: Niclas Eliasson, Alex Mowatt.

ST: Sammy Ameobi, Michael Jacobs, Harry Cornick.",2020-06-27
"I like that lineup a lot. In coming weeks, I think we will see squad rotation with Amos rotating through the DM role, Kane relieving Rangel at RB, and some Lee Wallace at any of the CB or LB roles.

Is there anyone that can play striker other than Hugill?",2020-06-19
Pretty much spot on but Cameron's out suspended so it'll most likely be Amos instead.,2020-06-19

"I'd be happy for the season to finish without fans, obviously it's not as good but I just think from the perspective of trying to get back onto schedule for the football calendar it makes things a lot easier, it'll be a while before large crowds can gather safely and I would at least rather that by summer we could have the euros and end of the season happen without delays stacking up all over the place

I do support a suggestion I saw somewhere that one fan for each team could get tested like the players and staff and go to the game though! I feel like the players would be able to give a bit more if there was one lad going mental in the stands!",2020-05-29

"Hey! I'm a relatively new supporter too, nice to know there's a few of us. 

In terms of the new squad, I'd say that the main focus at the moment is new, young talent. The club was in the Premier League a couple of times in the past decade, and that basically ended up with the signing of a bunch of players who were good in their day, but past their prike/players who took home a big paycheque but didn't do much for the club. The club seems to have turned a corner on this - if you look up highlight reels of Ebere Eze (almost certainly our best player and a lot of talk about him) Bright Osayi-Samuel, Ilias Chair they're maybe the biggest prospects. In general the current manager Mark Warburton had a limited budget in his first transfer window so had to sign a lot of young or unknown prospects, and is performing above expectations with his current results.

In terms of history and former legends, I'm not the most qualified to say, but I can reccommend listening to the last few episodes of Open All Rs (a fan podcast) where they talk through things like their favourite games, favourite players dating back to the 70s and 80s - this has given me a good insight and will help you get an insight into the nature of the fans, the club, past players etc. Also the club has been streaming season reviews of some big seasons e.g. 75/76 (highest ever league finish), 2010/11 (promotion winning) as well as big games eg 1967 league cup win. Hope this helps!",2020-05-21
Welcome to the family! I’ve been a supporter all my life (mid twenties) and seen us play in 3 different divisions. Let me know if you have any questions :),2020-05-21
"Welcome! I'd highly recommend listening to the QPR podcast, they regularly cover not only what's going on with the club now but our history. 

I'd also watch the four year plan on amazon prime. It's a fly on the wall documentary about the club's current ownership before our current owners and the circus that QPR was between 2009 and 2011.

Generally we're a club known for finding and developing unknown young players and selling them onto bigger clubs for a profit whilst playing attractive attacking football and we have a history for maverick attacking midfielders who wear the 10 shirt (Stan Bowles, Adel Taaeabt, Rodney Marsh, Eze).

In the last decade our current owners tried changing this by spending big on established stars and it didn't really work and got the club into a lot of debt. Since our last relegation from the premier League and the appointment of former star striker Les Ferdinand as director of football we've tried to go back to the old ways of developing unknown players with mixed results but we've seen real progress this season under Mark Warburton's management. 


I've been a fan all my life so if you want to know anything feel free to ask.",2020-05-21
"Welcome! Hopefully you'll have a chance to visit at some point - the club's history and tradition is very much part of its present, and that's best experienced at Loftus Road. 

It's fantastic to hear from fans around the world from yourself, but as a relatively small club the majority of the fan base are locals, born into QPR families. And when I say locals, I mean local to a pretty small area of London. Loftus Road reflects that - it's an old-fashioned ground, boxed into the housing estate that supplies some of its support. It's literally embedded in its community. Football clubs in Britain have an integral relationship with their local communities, particularly workers. That's faded a bit since they've become huge businesses in their own right, but QPR has one of the best run charities in British sport. Because of that closeness between the club and the people, Loftus Road is a great place to watch football and experience what it means, historically, to the area.

A lot of the old pros still hang around the ground or are involved in the running of the club, so if you're interested there's a decent chance you  grab one for a quick handshake. It'll all seem pretty titchy and old school if you're used to the scale and shinyness of US sport, but if you like it, it'll hook you for life.

If you wanted to look up one player who sums up QPR it's probably Stan Bowles. And he's not even a Londoner. He was one of QPR's vaunted number 10's, a mercurial, skillful, shaggy-haired attacker who sustained a pretty full-on gambling addiction all through his playing days (and beyond). He lives just south of the river I think and used to sign autographs outside of the club shop on most match days, but sadly has alzheimers now and hasn't been seen for a while. Still, at most home games the fans still clap throughout the 10th minute to show that they're thinking of him. As good an example as any of how the history lives at Loftus Road.",2020-05-21
"Welcome! You need to know about the 75/76 season, where QPR beat Leeds at Loftus Road in their final match to go a point ahead of Liverpool at the top of the English Football League. Sadly Liverpool still had one game to play, away to relegation threatened Wolves, and due to Liverpool's European commitments it was not played until ten days later. For those ten days little QPR were Champions of England. And when it was finally played, Wolves scored first and held on until 13 mins from the end, when Liverpool equalized and then went on to score two more to claim the 1976 title. Most players from that team are considered QPR legends. It was something like this: 1 - Phil Parkes, 2 - Dave Clement, 3 - Ian Gillard, 4 - Terry Venables, 5 - Frank McLintock, 6 - David Webb, 7 - Dave Thomas, 8 - Gerry Francis, 9 - Don Masson, 10 - Stan Bowles, 11 - Don Givens, (12 - Mick Leach).

In all the polls I've seen (and I've seen a few), Stan Bowles has always been voted QPR's best ever player with Rodney Marsh a close second and the rest of the pack a way back. Gerry Francis 3rd for me -- he did captain England, after all!",2020-05-21

"Plenty to choose from but I’ll go with someone that is less likely to be chosen by anyone else and that is Danny Shittu. 

Came to the club at a time when we were desperate, signed by the fans after impressing on loan. Raw, strong, dominant. Him and Carlisle & the back still probably my favourite CB pairing in years.

Met him a few times over the year. Always an absolute gentleman. 

Felt so bad for him when he did his knee. He played the game out with ruptured ligaments and didn’t even realise. What a beast. 

And if any further proof needed:

Need a long-term RB for sure, but. I think Rangel can be serviceable in the Championship for one more year and hopefully put in 20-25 starts. 

Appreciate the reviews. Keep up the good work!",2020-04-29
"Encouraging that there’s quite a few decent fullbacks coming available. We’ve definitely struggled a bit with right back and it looks likely we might lose Manning. I’d like Kakay to be given a bit of a chance but interesting to see what Warburton thinks of him. 

Thanks for these write ups. Really enjoyed them.",2020-04-29
"I’m not sure about Kelly. I’d like to see Dieng given a chance as first choice keeper. I’m not convinced with Kelly’s ability to do the basics, like shot-stopping and commanding his area. 

He does the more eye-catching things well, I agree. But what I really miss about Smithies is his reliability. I didn’t tend to question whether he should have saved shots. With Kelly and Lumley I often wonder if they should have saved at the near post, got down to that shot, tipped that over the bar, had a stronger hand to that shot. And if I do, so might his teammates, which isn’t great for morale. 

Enjoyed the reports. Thanks.",2020-04-26

"That was the most incredible atmosphere from the 1st minute to the last, great game, Loftus Road was shaking after that goal went in, pure bedlam moment lol
My favourite memory of this game was Mata running up to take a corner to tons of abuse, then leaving the pitch moments later with an ""injury"", but the truth is that aside from Terry, Lampard, Cole and Luiz, they just couldn't handle it, the most hate filled 90 minutes towards a team you'll probably never see the likes of again, us fans were a huge factor in swinging the odds in our favour that day.

"Firstly, I think you need some context about football in Finland in general. First of all, football isn't really a popular sport to watch here. A pretty staggering example is that in my university class of approx 40 engineering students (read: 20-25 yo young men) I am the only one who follows football apart from watching the champions league and the world cup finals when they're on tv.

This lack of interest in domestic or european football allowed me to go without watching a SINGLE FOOTBALL MATCH until the 2014 world cup, during which I got to know a few guys at school who followed football a bit more. Even after that world cup all I really did was play a bit of Fifa now and then.

This is where QPR comes to play. You know when you have to select a favourite team when you create your Fifa account? Not really knowing anyone outside the top 6, but still having my usual mindset of supporting the underdog I thought to myself ""Nah let's go with this team called QPR, I think I can still change it later on"". I didn't really think about it as ""this is the team I'll support"", to be honest I'm not sure if I even intended to really support anyone at that point. But boy, only if I knew what I had just signed up for. I think I watched my first match because I found Charlie Austin hanging aroung the top scorer charts in the league interesting especially as QPR were in a relegation battle. It was a huge cluster of a being a underdog in a city with so many huge football clubs, a ridiculously small 18k capacity stadium and a relegation battle. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea but I found it really appealing.

The final nail in the coffin was when I visited London with my family in summer of 2015. We even had an apartment in west London, a walking distance away from LR. Because it was summertime I never got to a match and even the new kit wasn't released until the next week but all I got was a QPR coffee mug and a scarf from the hilariously named ""superstore"". As if that wasn't enough the Shepherds Bush area really seemed, and still seems, like a place where normal people live, and I found the area really nice.

The next 2015/16 season I went to complete the military service that is obligatory here, but surprisingly got to know two guys who followed football (and supported City and Liverpool \*sigh\*) who got to know more about QPR during that year than they probably ever would have. I listened to Finney and co.'s QPR podcast on my journeys there and back but that was about it in terms of following outside Twitter.

16/17 season I got the audio pass, and followed us a lot more than the previous season purely for the fact that I spent my weekends at home instead of in a foxhole with an assault rifle. The first game of 2017/18 was my first live match, 2-0 win against Reading and more staggeringly a Washington brace, after which I had just introduced myself to a very expensive hobby of travelling to the UK every year to watch a match or two.

If you had told me six years ago I'd be spending a ridiculous amount of my week watching or following some shite FOOTBALL TEAM from West London I wouldn't have believed you, but here I am thinking if we will start with Rangel or Kane next weekend having just finished booking my trains to the airport to fly over for the Cardiff (A) and Blackburn (H) double next month!

Amos was the first to make way, his tenacious energy and technical ability all but pointing to him being a Premier League player in waiting. It was his legs and engine which cause the midfield diamond of Stoke's problems all afternoon. As soon as he went off, Rangers lost something despite his replacement being the promising signing of Marc Pugh.

Personally I think we might surprise a few this season after a major revamp in the summer window, even though such a major redo doesn't come entirely risk free. I doubt we'll go down but as bad as it feels to say it realistically playoffs are probably out of reach as well.

"Allowing myself to feel cautiously optimistic that this season won’t be the car-crash that FFP made it look like it was going to be. Whatever his successes and failures have been at his previous clubs Warburton has a clear vision having taken on a job that owing to the restrictions and requirements on the club no one wanted. 

Starting with a squad starkly different to the one that ended last season might be a good thing, hunger and willingness to adapt to the new boss’s plans. Some great signings on permanent/loan basis have given us a balanced squad. Still think we are slightly light up front, and this coupled with an entirely new system of play could be our undoing. I hope we don’t get cold feet and stick with the man and the plan until the season is done. 

One-to-watch: Amos - seemingly a class above.

League finish: 13th.",2019-08-02

His 2018 season review at Aberdeen:

>To bracket the defender as the best young Scot to have emerged in the Premiership this season would not be overstating the point. Quite simply the 21-year-old has been sensational since stepping up against Motherwell in September. Powerful, quick, good at reading the game and with the knack for a goal - remember his howitzer against Kilmarnock - McKenna has it all. And can still get better.  
>  
>McInnes rates him massively and booted out three bids from Hull City in the January window before McKenna signed a new deal taking him through to 2023.  
>  
>One criticism that could be levelled against the defender is he has failed to deal with the threat of Celtic and Rangers but that is more a collective than individual criticism and legendary Dons defender Alex McLeish has made him a first pick in his new-look Scotland side. The 6ft 3in defender was man of the match in Tuesday night's win in Hungary.

From a best defenders in SPL article:

>The young defender is a reminder that, regardless of how much you study and dissect football, it will always present you with things you just didn’t see coming.  
>  
>This time last year the centre-back had only recently completed a disappointing loan spell with Ayr United, where McKenna had long been relegated to the bench for some erratic play, including a brutal challenge on John McGinn in a Scottish Cup defeat at Easter Road. With little sign of a first-team place at Pittodrie on the horizon he was facing an uncertain future. If he couldn’t hack it at the Scottish Championship level then what kind of career did that leave?  
>  
>In the end he needn’t have worried. Pitched into the starting XI this season to add a bit more steel to the Aberdeen defence in place of Mark Reynolds, McKenna impressed in the 1-0 win. Soon the one-off success became a good month, then a good few months, and now a great first season, which has been rewarded with a Young Player of the Year nomination and international honours.  
>  
>Physically he’s everything you could ask for in a central defender. Broad, tall, robust and doesn’t run like he’s towing a tractor. But what’s been most impressive is his consistency. There have been a couple of shaky performances of late - most notably in the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Motherwell - but overall he’s made very few mistakes. He’s undoubtedly been the club’s best defender this term, and arguably their best player.

With 12 caps for Scotland at 22 years old, McKenna would be a fantastic signing.  Prying him away from Aberdeen will be the hard part.  Would likely have to pay upwards of 5-6 million.  Could potentially sell-on in a few years for twice that.  I do like the strategy of trying to make one big signing with a transfer fee though.",2019-07-30
The risk seems to be more about if he can adapt to the championship. If he can then the ~5 million he'll be sold for will be pocket money compared to the eventual selling fee.,2019-07-30

"Really tells something when so many teams have still spent under a million. Absolute madness that most clubs can't afford to buy average players from other clubs in the same division, and even lower league prospects are often ridiculously expensive. Surely it's got to change by lowering the asking prices or loosening the ffp regulations?",2019-07-29
"Agree with a lot of this.  To the first point, Hugill will provide much improved finishing than... exactly.  His strike rate in his 20 apps for Middlesbrough last season was about 1 goal per 7 shots.  In his best season, with Preston in 2016/17, his strike rate was about the same.  To put that into perspective, Wells strike rate for us was about 1 goal per 14 shots.

On the topic of our youngsters.  With the exception of Furlong we actually saw quite a number of youth products on the pitch against Watford.  As a fan of this club there is a certain element of love that clouds my judgement when it comes to players who have come through our academy or that were snapped up as teenagers.  Particularly with these types of players they want to play for the badge and they might even love QPR as much as we do.  When we lose these types of player it hurts more than usual.  Take Harry Kane for example, he loves Tottenham.  He always wanted to play for Tottenham and that quality allows the team as a whole to punch above their weight as there is a reduced risk of Kane *wanting* to move to another club.  The point isn't that Kane and Furlong are similar in ability, they aren't, but that players who have loved their club since childhood can have a major impact on the team overall.

Joe Lumley, who has been with QPR since he was 15, is starting regularly for the first team.  Ilias Chair came in as a 19-year old two years ago.  If anyone watched the last 20 minutes against Watford you'll know that Chair showed real desire and almost produced the goods on two occasions.  He could have a breakout season.  Ryan Manning also came to the club as a 19-year old four year ago and has seen a significant uptick in first team appearances.  In fact, he appears locked into the left back role and could continue even when Wallace returns from injury.  Eberechi Eze came here as an 18-year old three years ago and is clearly locked into the first team.  Finally we have Olamide Shodipo, of who I've been a big fan of throughout his time here, who came to the club as a 15-year old seven years ago.  He has historically had back luck with injuries but I've seen the most out of him this preseason and he appears to factor into Warburton's plans.  All in all, it is exciting to see this many youngsters figure into the first team and shows that there is development going on within the youth ranks.",2019-07-29
"Wish we knew the true financial picture.  We seem more desperate to sell than ever.

Hugill set to sign before Monday with one more still to come. Leistner and Luongo still tipped to leave.  Goss and Wheeler also leaving, waste of a transfer those two were.

That is heart breaking if true! Not that he is a game changer or anything but he is a youth academy product with loads of upside and what I presume to be on a pretty fair wage. You have to assume this move is strictly financial as he is more than capable of being an everyday player at RB.,2019-07-22
"I can see why some fans are disappointed with this move because it does seem to go against the ethos we are attempting to employ, with young players coming through the academy. However, I believe Rangel is a better Right-back than Furlong and we have enough depth at Centre-back now to not necessarily need him as cover. It looks like we might be getting Dujon Sterling in on loan from Chelsea who impressed at Coventry on loan last year and is confident on the ball, whereas Furlong regularly looked questionable on the ball.",2019-07-22
Wouldn't be that concerned about him leaving if we had a decent replacement already in the club but I'm worried that we're replacing too many players in one window which may result dropping some important points during the opening half of the season,2019-07-22
"Surely there can't be any truth to this.  Rangel won't last the season.  I think Darnell still has two years left on his contract. Youth product, still getting better.  Silly to sell now unless it's for a BIG fee.

Selling Furlong just so we can put in a bigger bid for an over 30 midfielder is a fools errand.",2019-07-22

"Depends who the team is at the time. Adam Hulme and Ian Taylor were rather decent for our club. Ian Taylor with the player interview etc. We also had London Calling. Adam Hulme has since gone to manage social media at Liverpool.

Our social media has been fine, but yeah, nothing too much more than that.",2019-07-02
"Probably a bit long and no structure to it, but here you go:

Our dalliance in the Premier League wasn't good for the club as both Harry Redknapp and Mark Hughes spent millions on players, giving them high salaries, without actually thinking about how to put them in the team or whether they actually wanted to play for the club.

This financially crippled us, and relegation, with the lack of guaranteed income to pay these players, has impacted the team ever since. We have had to sell players when we could, and essentially buy on the cheap. 

There are two things that have been very important in the last couple of years with QPR - 'parachute payments' and 'Financial Fair Play (FFP)'. Parachute payments refer to money that teams relegated from the Premier League receive, I believe for 4 years after relegation. They ensure that teams don't immediately go under (due to high wages). The payments hav just run out for QPR, but unfortunately during those 4 years the club didn't really adjust well enough. This led to us letting our club captain, Nedum Onuoha, go for free a year ago as we couldn't afford his wages, and means that we're selling players for usually a lot less than they're worth as we need the money (and often need to get rid of players!). FFP also has a bearing here. Financial Fair Play is complicated, but can essentially be boiled down to 'spending reasonably within your means'. QPR haven't done this, and have been fined and threatened with the loss of points. The club has a tiny income and therefore FFP has also led to pressure and a need to sell players.

With all that financial fun it's led to a team that hasn't really got very good players as we've needed to pick them up on the cheap. There are still some shining lights. Luke Freeman is our best player by a mile, Massimo Luongo is an Australian international who can be great but is inconsistent, and Eberechi Eze is a fantastic prospect. Freeman and Luongo might be gone this month or next though haha.

With the manager, Warburton seems like a good recruitment. There weren't many good options for QPR as we don't have the best reputation at the moment (lots of managers have come and gone recently, there's not really any money). Warburton is great at setting up scouting networks, he has a clear tactical preference and he's had success in the division before. Judging him by our signings so far this season, he's been very sensible, got in some solid players, and we've got rid of a few players that we didn't really need - positive so far!

We are not aiming for promotion at all at the moment as the team just isn't in the right place, financially or to be honest mentally. We've finished poorly in the league in the last 2 seasons, and the best hopes are for a mid-table finish and a bit of respectability restored. Hopefully Warburton can use this season to set some groundwork to build upon for the future, and grow the club, but with QPR's recent luck I'm not gonna get my hopes up just yet!",2019-07-02
"Your best bet for watching games is to buy the QPR+ streaming package from the club. Occasional technical difficulties but on the whole pretty good. ESPN+ only carries the matches that get picked up for television which is generally only a handful, but those aren't available via QPR+ so it's good to have both.",2019-07-02
"I hope you do follow us, we need all the fans we can get !",2019-07-02
"I'll add my 2 cents as an american but most things have been covered. QPR+ is the only way to watch them. With ESPN+ you will see one game at most all season.  

One thing I'll add is that Rangers aren't historically and likely never will be ""classy"". The fan favorites have all been mavericks or hard workers. My personal favorites were the mid-2000's teams where I could best describe the players as ""blue-collar"". I live in the DC area so if you are around should start a watch party group for the season come August.",2019-07-02

I know he’s near the end but he may as well end his career with us as long as he can keep up and down the pitch. I would love to keep Pav for a workable winger and think Freeman will be sold. 

All that being said, everyone who can’t score needs a striker and I don’t know how we’ll get one on the cheap. I’d love someone who can play off Eze and has some pace, if only to make them completely different than Smith. Is Paul Smyth a Center mid? I feel like he may be able to transition to a Center Forward at least and I think BOS and Chair make me actually excited to see how we can attack next year.",2019-04-19
"I thought the club was slowly trying to sort out the wage structure, but after hearing what Wells, Hemed and Cameron might be on (all rumours admittedly) I really have no idea about the finances of the club.

Looking at the squad list on the website, these are the players that I reckon should leave:

**Ingram** Gotta go I think. Didn't cover himself in glory and might as well give his spot to a youngster. Hopefully can rejuvenate his career somewhere else.

**Lynch** If it means we can sign someone else, I'd like to see him go. Like you said, not reliable enough and could be on a big wage. If we don't have anyone on the horizon I guess we'd have to keep him though.

**Freeman** Our best player, but we need the cash to strengthen the team.

**Wheeler** Not much point keeping him unless we're going to play him. He's 28.

---
With the loanees also going, this would be our strongest team without signings:

Lumley, Rangel, Hall, Leistner, Bidwell, Wszolek, Luongo, Scowen, BOS, Eze, Smith

This a very weak side, and would probably get relegated. If Hall can get back to playing well that'll help us out, but this window we'll need at least a CB, LB (unless Manning can play there, discussed on Loft For Words) RM, CM, LM and ST. As well as a manager of course. 

Not looking too positive for next season imo, unless some of the youngsters like Chair and Oteh suddenly step up!",2019-04-19

Plus - it's not sustainable. Why pay to improve someone else's players when we can do that with our own? We need to turn some of our own youth players into sustainable assets no matter what division we're in.

I don't see Freeman being with us past this season. The goal of next season will simply be to not get relegated. Whoever the manager is needs to have experience doing that and also be willing to develop young players as we can. ,2019-04-02
"While I don't know the exact manager we'll settle on, I think it will play out like this:

Freeman and Eze will go in the summer, hopefully we can get 10-15 million between them.  We can use that money to buy at least 4-5 players, which we will absolutely need.  Maybe we can buy Wells too.  We are not a club on the up, rather, we are trying to find financial stability by cutting every single non-essential cost.  We will likely not hire a manager who is used to big spending, but rather someone who has shown the ability to do lots with little (ex: Lee Bowyer).",2019-04-02
"Appointing Sherwood would be disastrous - we simply do not have the financial resources to fund his managerial philosophy, and I don’t believe he would be able to inspire the belief that is desperately required within the players to avoid relegation.

Brining in Ainsworth could go either way. He has shown that he can bring out the best in younger players like Eze, who he had on loan at Wycombe. However, with this being such a tricky transitional period for the club, has he demonstrated the grit to keep us afloat? I’m not sure. We need a figure who will fire up the squad, someone to show them that they’ll need to scrap to survive. 

I personally would be pleased with the appointment of either Moore or Bowyer - the steady tactical approach Moore displayed during his time at West Brom would certainly be welcomed at QPR; more players need to be trusted with increasing responsibilities, we cannot continue to rely on our mainstays like Freeman - I feel like this would happen under Moore’s management. Bowyer on the other hand, although not as tactically sound in my opinion, has demonstrated during his time at Charlton that he is able to succeed with a small squad and limited finances.

The focus for the rest of the season must be to remain in the Championship - after that, some fundamental changes need to take place. I just hope the board makes a wise appointment now and gives whomever they choose the time to develop and execute their vision for the club. The fans could do with some good times in the R’s future.

 ",2019-04-02
"Lew Bowyer gets my vote, done wonders at a club who bring through the youth and have no money to spend plus aparently his football is good to watch.

Is Robbie Stockdale an option?,2019-04-02
"Yeah, I get what you mean, I understand the logic too. Definitely, there needs to be an injection of energy in the squad. I’d love to see Penrice work his magic to bring in some of the young upstarts of the Premier League, even on loan deals because they’ll be the players that’ll be hungry for success. It would just be a matter of finding those players who would be willing to come in on a much lower wage. 

Yes, I agree that he’d get a lot of patience from the fans. Certainly more than a few of the names listed in the original post. I just hope that whomever comes in receives patience from the owners - I really feel the club needs to be steadied by a singular vision. There’s such a mix of expectation from both the fans and the owners. I was listening to Luke Freeman talk on the Loftcast about how it’s the games were the R’s are expected to win that are the most difficult. I think there needs to be a collective conscious instilled in the fans and the board that we are now a club that’s far from the heights of the Premiership - I think that will only come about with a manager who has been given time, I just hope they appoint a good one.

"Agree 100% on Lynch, we are miles better with Hall at the back.  Bidwell is probably having his best season with us, and has become an improved player over the years.  I think a more accurate description of him would be reliable and consistent - which is exactly what we need at the back.  Now, would Robinson have taken his place if he had stayed? Most likely.  Is he the weak leak in the defense right now? Absolutely not.  We have to sort out the center back situation as it has been our Achilles heel over the years.  The last time we weren't consistently shipping goals was when Dunne was in the squad.

I put Scowen in the same boat as Lynch, he had one good season under Holloway and now regularly sprays misplaced passes across the pitch.  Cousins has been an injury prone let down since he came to the club.  Interestingly, he has probably shown his best form in the last few games and, if he can keep it up, he could have a place in the squad yet.

I'm been pleasantly surprised by Lumley, especially after the two massive saves he made today, but you are spot on in your overall assessment of both him and Eze.

Remember earlier in the season when we were playing Wells and Hemed, but we were still losing.  Maybe it could work again but we have tried it and it didn't work.  I think we can all agree that Smith is a limited footballer but I'm willing to give him a few more games paired up with either Wells or Hemed.

Cameron and Rangel were the catalyst behind our ascendancy towards the top-half of the table before Christmas.  We have struggled since they went out injured.  However, with the exception of Sheffield we have been missing out on points by slim margins and against good teams.  We cannot underplay the effect the transfer embargo and lack of a budget has had on our ability to strengthen the squad in any way.",2019-02-19

"I've been to three home matches now from Finland, sat two times at the very block you mentioned, ellerslie road block v, regarding the view the middle section right hand side of the block is probably the best in the stadium (no pillars and centre of the pitch) if you don't count the one small block at the south africa road stand. Last time out I sat at the loft-end side of south africa road stand but personally preferred ellerslie road just because the wc/beverage area is a lot roomier out there since it's not indoors.

But yeah if you want to get involved in the singing business then the R-block is definitely the place to be, personally I'll probably try out the R-block or the R-block side of the loft next time I fly over since I'm getting more familiar with the chants.

From a tourist's point of view I really had no trouble finding anything despite going alone, you can even bring normal sized backpacks as long as you let the stewards check them.

E: Oh and also if you intend to buy something from inside the stadium make sure to bring some cash with you, some kiosks have card readers but some don't! I think matchday programmes are also cash only if you don't buy those at the superstore.",2019-02-17

"I think the QPR website posts a list about the available matches every month but unfortunately you just don't know about the matches until Sky or other broadcasters announce their selections usually 1-2 months prior to the match. So far at least Villa, Millwall and Norwich at home have been on tv, but fortunately for some reason the QPR matches tend to be picked more by the overseas broadcasters (BeIn in Australia if I'm not completely mistaken) which you'll be able to watch in a pub or such.

My question is do QPR give a shit if he doesn't play because he's 28 and not really in the first team plans, I would understand Villa being annoyed Andre Green isn't playing because he's 19 and a prospect for them, but Wheeler seems to me more of a loan to get his wages off the books when he isn't needed, there's no risk of him being recalled right?",2018-11-13

"I think Lukey's not even been that bad on the wing and he's really good at tracking back but just looking at the numbers he got for assists from the middle last season really suggests that a central position is by far his strongest.

I think Eze's more out of position on the wing than Luke even though he can run at defenders, he's at his best when he's on the ball a lot much like Freeman which neither really achieve at the wing.

If Steve insists on playing both at the same time then Luke's the one to play on the wing with Eze in the middle, much like a 4-2-3-1 with Wells or Hemed up top depending on the opposition. I'd really love to see BOS given a go in the league, he was playing really well at the end of last season and in the cup this season so I find it quite strange that Steve's not given him more minutes in the league. He'd really improve our counter-attack threat as well. ",2018-10-01
"You are bang on with your point about our formation.  Playing Freeman and Eze as wingers is perfectly analogous to ""square peg, round hole"".  Due to this they are being severely underutilized.  Unfortunately they share the same preferred position, which means we could only play one of them at a time.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  This ""square peg, round hole"" situation we find ourselves in has knock-on effects across the whole team, specifically for Hemed and Wells.  We need to deploy some proper wingers, BOS, Smyth, Wszolek, move Freeman back to his preferred position, and move Eze to the bench.

More worryingly though is that several players seem to have regressed following Holloway's departure.  Wszolek, Scowen, Smyth, Freeman, just to name a few.  The togetherness of the squad overall just seems to have unravelled somewhat under SMc.  Maybe this can be addressed by getting back to winnings ways.",2018-10-01
"Sure, the performance on the pitch wasn't what we wanted it to be and some of that responsibility lies on the players.  SMc must be quite conceited though if he thinks none of the blame is his.  Smith was isolated up front and we couldn't get our wingers into the game.  Tactics come into play at one level or another, and that blame falls squarely on the manager.",2018-09-26
"R block for atmosphere, v block in the ellerslie road stand or basically any seat in the South Africa Road stand for the view. Also being a foreign fan I tried out the F block in the South Africa Road stand and unfortunately had a really good seat for the 0-3 loss against Bristol City in August. You just have to mind the pillars around the stadium but the restricted seats are clearly marked. I'm still a bit shy with the chants so I really don't mind sitting outside the R block. Probably have to try it out the next visit though!

"I am a yank who went to Loftus Road and I was able to secure tickets surprisingly pretty easily although it was Wigan Athletic on a Tuesday night. I thought you had to be a member but I got the tickets through general sale on QPR’s website. Tickets were £20. I bought a match program and a Carlsberg. My only gripe is that the team store closed pretty early (I tried going after the match ended). Think of Loftus Road as being a smaller version of Fenway Park-older than Fenway and seats were kind of small and uncomfortable. Good atmosphere I would say though. Hopefully you can score tickets for the Villa game as my guess is those will be in much more demand than Wigan Athletic.

"Unfortunately I think we will be at our best when only one of Freeman or Eze is playing, although they are our two most talented players. Getting a true winger like BOS on the pitch will open things up and bring the strikers into the action more and give whoever the number 10 is more space and freedom to operate. ",2018-09-03

"I think it's a huge upgrade for our attack, but I'm not sure this will stop us from shipping goals. Although it's a pipe dream, I think Hall getting healthy could turn things around, but overall the issues are still in the back. 

With that being said, it's easy to get excited about these two, and it's the kind of loan I've wondered why we've been unable to get for so long. Prem teams constantly have players who are young or on the peripheries of the rotation, who are perfect for championship sides. If we can pull a defender like that, we might be able to survive",2018-08-23

"As I have said elsewhere the first half was good, we actually played well and I think we were the better team, even though WBA were looking dangerous on the counter. 

In the second half the mistakes crept in and heads dropped, the more nervous people are, the more mistakes we will see, thus the floodgates opened and as we know, WBA have some PL standard players in there and put 4 past Norwich last weekend. 

Our major problem is how uncomfortable our back line looks with the ball at their feet, every time a team presses us we look like we're going to make a mistake - The same thing happened against Sheffield United.",2018-08-19

"Eze was easily MOTM, you know he's good when a Champions League side has to assign two players to mark him in open play. He also seemed to get fouled every two minutes and eventually caused the freekick that got us the Leistner goal. Leistner played really well and got a goal to top up the display, overall we caused our own problems with misplaced passes but I'm confident that will be fixed when the players get used to this new system.  Bright caused all sorts of trouble to their backline as he came on and had a good final 20 minutes. A really positive display overall IMO, we could beat many Championship sides playing like that. Can the season start already?",2018-07-21
"Hey! Don't usually post but I'm bored at work xD 

Judging from McClaren's previous roles, this upcoming season could either be a real success or end up like last season: lower-mid table. The good thing is that apparently he's very good at man-management (especially with youngsters) and when he was a coach with us last time round we were very successful.

Depending on the formation obviously, I think our midfield is sorted, and Eze seems to be an exciting prospect as a second striker or something similar. Hope Matt Smith starts more up front as he's good at what he does. Feel sorry for Connor Washington as he's been really poor in general since he joined (not for the want of trying!), but maybe this will be his season.

We need more defenders definitely. We missed Hall a lot last season, but we need more faces in that department in general. We'll see what happens! Let's try to be optimistic :D ",2018-07-18

I can understand if Ollie has personal reasons why he needs to step away, and I would certainly never wish anything but the best for him and his family if there are things off the pitch. But on the pitch, and given the limitations the club has on it, I thought he did a pretty good job this year.

"I'll go first:

https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/5aa2f0108dd5dd25d4d2e3cd

Selections + reasons:

**Smithies:** No real reasons needed here

**Bidwell:** IMO a really solid LB, not a good wingback. If Robbo plays CB, no real competition for this position.

**Robinson:** One of our best players this season, maybe switch to Lynch when opposing to a side with big and tall forwards. Also suprisingly good at CB despite only being introduced to the position this season.

**Onuoha:** Despite all the stick he gets he's arguably our best defender. Brings experience to the otherwise relatively young backline and the team in whole.

**Furlong:** Only real competition is Perch, brings some threat going forward as well. Maybe switch to Perch when some stability is needed with the cost of some pace.

**Luongo:** Picks himself.

**Scowen:** Picks himself.

**Eze:** Just looks better and better every time I watch him play. A really exciting prospect who needs gametime and brings some unpredictability to the side along with Smyth. Don't know if he's familiar with playing on the wing so positioned him as a part of the middle three. Switch positions with Freeman when necessary.

**Freeman:** Picks himself, switch with Eze when necessary. Winger position make sense since he has the ability and skill to run at defenders and he's arguably one of the best crossers and passers in the league.

**Sylla:** A really tough choice between him and Conor. The striker position overall is the one I don't really have a solid pick for. Really depends on the opposition and if we are going to press hard and counter (Washington, maybe Sylla, some doubt on the pressing for him) or just depend on crosses to the big man Smith. Ollie should really be careful with when to start Matt because when doing that he loses one of our biggest assets from the bench. Also with Smith up front we always end up hoofing the ball more than I'd like so I'd certainly keep the starting striker selection mostly between Conor and Idrissa.

**Smyth:** A real prospect along with Eze. Got past Derby's experienced defence over and over again and created really good chances with some lovely turns and backheels. Like Eze brings some unpredictability and flair to the side. Only real current competition is Pav, who sadly hasn't reached last season's levels this season, which may well be because of the wingback position.",2018-03-09
"Smithies

Bidwell Robinson Nedum Furlong

Freeman Scowen Luongo

Washington Sylla Smyth

My differences come from I like the way Freeman roams around the field and is able to facilitate and play make,  Putting him at a winger role relegates him to one side.  I like Washingtons running ability, don't know if Eze can handle a full game (didn't look too effective against burton when he started).  Smith or Sylla was tough because Smith is such a problem for the opposition but Sylla can actually finish which is what we've been lacking.",2018-03-09
"https://www.buildlineup.com/shared/5aa390498dd5dd25d4d2e441

I would play Freeman in the midfield three as the midfield balance with him, Scowen and Luongo is very good. Wheeler is more comfortable playing LW than Washington. Sylla is better in games where the opposition have big centre backs such as Bristol City and would rotate with Smith. Robinson, Hall and Onuoha would also all be fine options at centre back and I have no preference between the three. Perch could also rotate with Furlong, and Eze could be good from the bench or when Freeman is not playing.",2018-03-09

"Including Caulker, [we got rid of nine players, and shipped an additional three out on loan](https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/comprehensive-list-qprs-january-transfer-14231814).  This brings our squad size down to 28, just 2 over the league average of ~26.

We brought in no one.  I think FFP has had a drastic effect on our dealings this transfer window.

We really needed a striker, but I guess that depends on what the goals for the club are this year.  At this point, it really looks like a rebuilding year with an emphasis on not getting relegated.  This means we will probably have to endure some difficult to watch football, with a more optimistic outlook hopefully coming next season.

I'm somewhat worried we didn't offload or re-sign Onuoha, as letting him go on a free at the end of the season would be a waste.  The same goes for Robinson, who has been one of the most improved players this season, signing him on a three-year deal should be an absolute priority.",2018-01-31

"I think everyone will have their own opinion but for me, it was that Tony Fernandes, the then CEO, was so green. Most of his decisions were daft and his public pronouncements were counter-productive. In fairness, he inherited a haphazard setup but he took a long time to steady the ship, which I think has happened now.

I'm not sure what was worse - the Mark Hughes/Kia Joorabchian reign or Harry Redknapp's. But either way, Fernandes gave them a blank checkbook to sign dross and took no action despite there being zero spirit in the camp and rank football on show.

Things are much better now with Crazy Ollie, Evil Les and the Tottenham mafia, and Chris 'Scrooge' Hoos. For real though - there's a feeling that the ship has steadied, albeit at the lower reaches of the championship and much of that I think stems from Tony stepping back and letting people who know what they're doing hold the reigns.

How do you feel about Mourinho? Two very nice goals from Martial and Lingard today anyway.",2018-01-01
"I can’t speak for everyone hear but I’ll have a go. 11/12 season we stayed up on the final day. Our team didn’t have much talent but we had a set system and hard workers like Derry, mackie, Hill and so forth. String of goals from Djibril Cisse also helped. The next season Hughes brought in a lot of players on high wages who were really mercenaries. This alienated the players that qpr came up with and the team never played well. Didn’t get a win until late December. We came back up through the playoffs with guys like Austin, Fer, and Phillips. This was a good team, Austin being a class above scoring 18 goals I think. Our defense was old and leaky, Richard dune being one of our best players does not bode well. We conceded 73 goals that year. 

That’s the long answer. In short, our owner’s inexperience, terrible transfers and incompetence from Hughes and Redknapp (the latter buying players for a 3-5-2 and then abandoning the formation after a game) and mercenary players is why Qpr never performed well in the premier league.",2018-01-01
"Just watched the Brighton-Bournemouth match today and dreamt of us going up in a similiar style like them with proper structure behind everything and actually signing players that make sense instead of having big name and wage demands. Especially Brighton this season has made me go ""I'd like QPR to be like that some day"".",2018-01-01
"Okay

1st spell - Hughes bought a bunch of older players who'd already achieved loads and saw QPR as one last payday, only came cause we were paying big wages and many couldn't give a toss about our club. This formed a rift with the older non mercenary players in our team (Hill, Derry, Mackie etc)

2nd spell - Poor recruitment from Redknapp left a very unbalanced squad. He bought to play this 3 at the back formation with wing backs but dropped it after a couple of games which meant our squad didn't suit playing 4-4-2 (Isla, Fer and Vargas didn't fit that system). Hill and Austin papered over a lot of cracks that season. ",2018-01-01
"There's more to football than just putting a bunch of blokes in a team.
There's a culture at the club, there's the fans and there's the management.

Anyone can under perform at anything. Imagine if united went close to the relegation zone and everyone said that's it they're over... that will effect performance. Players are people and 'invisible' forces at a club can be seen on the pitch.

As for myself being an overseas fan I don't get to see a lot of QPR specific games however I watch football when I can from all over the globe. It's not an EA developed game it's not simple or predictable.

That's why I love football (bogans call it soccer in my country) and we watch it all the time it's always possible to see the unexpected and that's awesome.",2018-01-01
"I'll go first.

Regarding the youngsters (Petrasso, Lumley, Dieng, RGC, Kakay, Goss), haven't really seen enough (or at all) of them to decide what their fate should be. Shodipo was a good player for us when he played last season and I've been suprised he hasn't featured at all this season. If he is not getting minutes here then possibly a loan deal? Same goes for Goss. Worked magic for Eze.

From the more senior players, definitely get rid of JET, no point keeping him around. Borysiuk already went on loan once and still hasn't got a place in first team after his return, so I'd imagine he'll be on his way as well. Same thing for Yeni if we aren't going to play with wingers, sadly for him because I though he played okay last season in his correct position. Next, Caulker. Got through to play a few matches but then suddenly found himself playing for the U21 team again? Got to be quite high paid as well, no use for him IMO if he can't keep himself in a condition to play regularly.

Out of the players playing quite regularly, regarding Onuoha and Perch it really depends on what sort of wages they are on atm. Perch is okay and gets the job done but by no means should be near to the highest paid players on the squad. Onuoha is in my opinion a solid defender with loads of experience, which our relatively young squad really needs. Renew IMO, unless the wages are too much. Mackie is in the same boat with these two, good to have as a backup with reasonable wages but sadly may be past his prime years.

Do I need to speak about Robinson? Tie him down as quickly as you can, one of the best players in the squad this season IMO.

Tl;Dr: 

LOAN: Shodipo, Goss

OUT: JET, Borysiuk, Ngbakoto, Caulker.

DEPENDS ON CONTRACT: Onuoha, Perch, Mackie

IN: **ROBINSON**

The youngsters, as stated before, I'm going to leave to Ramsey and co at the youth team to judge, haven't seen enough of them personally.",2017-12-13
"Caulker and Ngbakoto - I'd be fine with seeing them go. Smithies and Sylla not so much, especially if Ingram is injured and so there's no point in recalling him from loan. 

Thought this was interesting:

>Shipping out players on big contracts is difficult, but less so once they are in the final months of those deals. From the perspective of both sides, an agreement then becomes more straightforward because virtually any financial deal cut in order for the player to go would represent a saving compared to paying his full wages for the remainder of the season.

Maybe the same would apply to Onuoha as his big money contract is up in the summer too though the club will be leery of letting him go I'd imagine.",2017-12-12

Is Ollie the man to take us back to the Premier League? Probably not with the current record.

But IMO he is the correct manager to start building a healthy foundation for a sustainable club with young and hungry players that actually want to be here. A foundation that can be used (hopefully sooner rather than later) by Ollie or the following managers to start finishing at the right end of the table on a consistent basis and perhaps one season resulting in a return to the Premier League with a well run club that can stay there for more than a season or two.

That being said, the gap to the bottom three cannot go much smaller or the board will have no choice.",2017-12-10

Les wants to trim the squad down, but probably not until the summer when many contracts go out. Les was also asked about JET, didn't say directly but let people know that he is not working hard enough to warrant a place in first team.

All three made it very clear that we are not going to spend millions on a striker, and we have to work with what we have unless a real bargain/free transfer comes up. Overall we are not going to buy new players unless we can get rid of some first.

Quite interestingly all three basically said that we are going to be a ""selling club"" until we cement a place in the premier league.

"I also traveled to my first match at Loftus Road from Finland this August (the opening day vs Reading). I thought the matchday was really well organized with clear signs so finding the right places was really easy. If I had needed to ask anything there were a lot of personnel walking around the outside of the stadium.

I sat at the Ellerslie Road stand block V, on the right hand side of the block looking in the Ticketmaster site, so I was pretty much sat where the halfway line is drawn (on the Ticketmaster site the blocks are placed a bit wrongly, the halfway line should be in between the V and T blocks). I really liked the seat, great view, no pillars or anything on the way, there are also a lot people around you so there was quite a noise when Washington scored his first of the day. I sat on the row K, the 11th(?) row from the ground, so you got a good view from above but thanks to the quite steep stands I was still really close to the pitch. But as said, if you go for purely the atmosphere, R block is the place to be!

Also, take some cash with you if you want to buy food or drinks at the stadium, there were apparently limited card readers and at least the one I bought my drinks from didn't have one at all.

And finally, if you have time get there early to catch some of the injured players at the superstore, got my programme signed by Hall on the day!

He's a good keeper that needs his time in goals. Lumley for backup I guess. Not too sure about that.,2017-08-31
"From our first goal to their 4th we showed a bit of positivity and fight but other than that it truly was piss poor. Yeni and Sylla didn't give a shit about the team or the result. I can't fault Baptiste much but he's slow, and playing him next to attacking defenders was always a bad idea. I know Holloway is being charitable but Caulker was woeful and rightly deserved to come off, can't see him playing again for a while. The only positives from that game were 1) the young lad Chair who really tried to prove he deserved to be in the team and had some excellent runs and enthusiasm and 2) Freeman when he came on, different class of player, but whenever he makes a mistake it always lead to a good chance for Brentford.

"I have tried not to jump to any conclusions based on pre-season friendlies in which the first team players are mixed with youngsters therefore not providing any real info on how the first team will do. In the Bournemouth game we played a team at least really close to our starting XI and I thought we looked okay.

Overall, I'm still quite neutral about our team, I think there are good players, especially in our midfield, who can make the difference on their day. 

I think the primary objective for this season should be reducing the amount of goals we let in. Last season we scored 52 goals but let in 66, if the goal amount remains the same but we manage to pinch for example 15 off the goals against, in the right matches, we should be looking for a comfortable mid table finish. As an example Derby scored 54, two more than us, last season but let in 16 goals less (50) and finished 9th.",2017-08-03
"Not as worried as some of the folk I’ve read on forums. I expect a lower-midtable finish, my worry is for many fans they won’t be happy with this and will turn on Holloway and we’ll end up changing manager again and repeating the whole fiasco of not giving our managers a full season to see what they can do. I think if Ollie can actually keep a settles side then we have a squad with some decent players in it, My main hope for the season if we can see players like Furlong, Manning and Washington improve with regular game time and maybe a few more players from our academy can break through to the first team. Definitely think we need a new right back to replace perch and an upgrade at centre back. ",2017-08-03
"I'm optimistic.  Remember, last time this year we were still trying to offload Sandro.  Think about that.  For the last two years we've been trying to offload players from our failed Premier League days.

We have a team now, we have no costly outcasts (Caulker might be costly but not an outcast).  We can actually build on what we have right now.  If the board can give Holloway some time we can build some consistency and chemistry within this group of players.

We might be missing some depth in a few areas but we also have some quality players.  A large FFP fine looms in the distance which is a destabilizing factor.  We are not going to be challenging for promotion this year but I believe we have something we can build on.",2017-08-03
"I'm somewhat indifferent. I've been thinking around 13th to 18th which would be fine.  I'm really worried about where the goals will come from.  Matt Smith isn't much of a goal threat.  Sylla, when i've watched him is inconsistent but he bagged 10? Washington had 7 but hes inconsistent as well.  We're a little thin up front.

Our midfield is good and I like our wingers (Freeman can play there, pavel and yeni are exciting too). I wonder of shodipo will get another run out along with petrasso maybe?  We have hard workers in that area

Our defense needs to sort it out.  Im hoping to see more furlong instead of Perch as the latter is on the last year of his deal and will probably be leaving after that.  Im backing bidwell and lynch to have a much better season.",2017-08-03

Well we didn't lose 😏😎,2017-07-22
"Some takeaways from that loss.  Smith's height is going to be vital for us this season.  He'll need to be getting crosses from the left and right.  Except... our only natural left wingers are El Khayati and Shodipo, who seem to be frozen out of the team.  Playing Washington out wide is a square peg in a round hole.  If we truly wanted we could stick Freeman out on the left.  He is a left-footed player and combined with Smith in their Bristol City days for a number of goals.  If we did stick Freeman out on the left we certainly have the depth in midfield to support that decision.  Centre of the pitch we have tons of options with Freeman, Luongo, Manning, and Goss potentially playing into the fold.  Good holding midfielders in Borsyiuk and Scowen.  On the right wing we have Wszolek, N'Gbakoto and Mackie (too bad they all play on the right).  In defense, we need to sell Caulker (or give him away) and play Furlong ahead of Perch.

Ideally we just need to fit round pegs into round holes.  Play players in their natural positions and we'll be alright.",2017-07-22

"Tl;dr:

Possible reasons which can delay the process:

-Discussing the transfer fee

-Discussing player's personal terms

-Discussing agent fees

-The agent/player discussing all above three with multiple clubs at the same time to get the best deal

-The selling club wanting to record the selling profit to the next fiscal year

-The wanted player is on a holiday

-Work permits

-Registering the player to the squad

And just adding to this, many clubs announce the signing the second they reach an agreement on transfer fee and personal terms (or only transfer fee), while we, according to Lee Hoos in those finance-videos, announce the new player when absolutely every bit of deals, permits and medicals are done. So even if we were progressing with transfers, we wouldn't know about it until the player is practically ready to play in a league match.

If he's genuinely contrite it seems like a shame not to offer him a way back - especially since Ollie wants him.

"I think this passage is excellent

> The fact is if you want a good, proven, ‘name’, British striker in the Championship at the moment you have to pay more than QPR can afford. Villa and Newcastle have inflated that to absolutely ludicrous levels and Derby paid nearly £10m for Vydra who scored five times. If Holloway and/or supporters think Sylla isn’t good enough and needs to be replaced with a proven Championship striker they’re dreaming – we can’t afford one. The other fact is, whether his English is good enough to understand the wisdom Holloway and Bircham want to impart onto him or not, the £1m bargain bucket African we picked up from Anderlecht has outscored almost all of the players other clubs paid astronomical money for. He accomplished that in a poor team, which provides its strikers with shit service, in his first year in the country, in his first year of Championship football, while being bounced in and out of the team, and while having his manager publicly slagging him off.

He may turn out to be shit but QPR’s finances are forcing them to look for transfers like this more often whether we like it or not and so far he’s been a success story. He deserves far more respect than he’s getting at the moment in my opinion.

I am more than okay with this as Mackie is great to have around the clubhouse and as a substitute when we need energy.,2017-05-19
"He's not shown up since he's come back from loan. Barely played and when he did he didn't look particularly interested. Rumours are we sent him back to Lazio before the season even ended so I'm assuming that was down to attitude.

A real shame as the first time he was here on loan he showed hatfuls of potential and helped change games but alas I feel he may be his own worst enemy and never fulfil his potential. Seems to be one too many managers now who have seen enough to get rid of him for whatever reason for it not to be him that's the issue.",2017-05-17
"I think we have a decent spine to the team. But there are changes that I would make, but not huge ones.

**GK** - Smithies/Ingram/Lumley as our three keepers - so even if we shift Smithies this summer, I'm not that worried. We're set at the position. 

**RB** - Furlong/Perch - I am always confused when I don't see Furlong's name on the team sheet, he should be one of the first on the list, he's consistent and shows a lot of promise, plus his dad sits in the same block as me... But Perch keeps making mistakes, and the more I watch him the more he scares me. He should be back up at this point and that's it. 

**CB x 2** - My starting pairing would be Hall and Nedum. They've been consistent players usually, and I still think Hall is better as CB than a CDM, although he's not bad there either. Ned is good and has had some great games, as well as a handful of total stinkers, but is our big game defender. I like Lynch but I think he's been exposed by his relative lack of pace, I watched him really get turned over by Bogle, who is so raw, but very physical for example. I'd keep them and add an extra CB while getting rid of Caulker, whom I like, but I think he needs a fresh start, where he can get his personal life in order. 

**LB** - Bidwell/Hamalainen/Robinson - Another position where I think we're set, having a good mix of experience and youth. I think Bidwell has proven he's a capable player at this level and doesn't usually make mistakes. I also like Robinson, but he has had a torrid time with injuries, which is a shame. I like Hamalainen, seems quick and unafraid to push up, had a very good cameo at Fulham in October.  

**MF** - Freeman/Luongo/Manning/Cousins/Goss/Doughty/Borysuik/Henry - I think Freeman has been a revelation. His quick feet are a joy to watch and he's been one of the players who seems to keep driving forward and is incredibly tricky to defend at this level. He should be the star of the team really. Luongo is a player I admire, he's had a lot of shit to deal with in his short time at QPR, but a battling midfielder and our best ball winner on his day. Excited to see him develop more and with some consistency in selection can become a key cog next to Freeman. Manning has also been a huge revelation this season, young, exciting and technically very good. I hope to see him being a regular starter unless he does get shifted to the Prem, in which case I wish him well. Though I do think another season or two here would be critical for his development. I am also a huge fan of Cousins, who had a raw deal being shunted out wide to accommodate others during JFHs tenure. I think we'll see a lot more from him, I watched a fair amount of him when he was at Charlton, as one of my mates is a fan, and I think he is another player who could be big for us, he has the engine, works hard, is young and has some crackers in him. I've seen very little from Goss, I think he's a project, needs to toughen up to stick in this league, but happy with the purchase, should have resale value in the future if he can live up to his potential. Doughty could be a defensive sub, who does lots of running and tackling - if Ollie ever considered it! I don't think he's got it in him to compete at this level, but I could be wrong. Borysuik I would like to see more of, although it seems like Ollie does not like him. Henry needs to leave, was useful a while ago, but limited and past it. 

**FW/ST** - Washington/Smith/Sylla/Petrasso/Mackie/Wszolek/Yeni/Shodipo/LuaLua (loan)/JET - We have an interesting mix of forward and wingers here. I would like to see Washington keep getting starts, no idea why he was benched when he was hot. I think he's finally finding his feet at this level and a season where he plays as the out and out striker will be great. Such a quick and tricky player. I would like to see Smith be used to knock down balls for Conor, not as the main plan, as it is ugly. Limited player, but hard working and could be useful for us. Sylla, is an interesting player. Inconsistent, but on his day his combination of speed and size make him dangerous. Very good rotation option and I think the highest scoring bench player in the league this season. Petrasso has shown glimpses over the past few seasons, needs a run of games to see what he has like Manning got really, not 35 minutes as a wing back. Mackie is a fan favourite and has shown he still has it in patches, like when we played Reading away, would keep him around (as we have already offered a contract).Wszolek is my signing of the season, technically a great player, a bit slow, but got to show what he can do and really happy with the signing. Scored some nice goals too! Yeni has finally found his feet after a rough start, with his dad passing and Ollie calling him fat... (terrible man management) and am excited to see what he can do now he knows his role and the English game. LuaLua has shown some flashes, might be worth signing him as I can't see Brighton needing him. Shodipo shouldn't have been loaned out, in my opinion, one of our best wingers, the kid puts in 100% and was a bright spark in a season of shite. Did well at Port Vale apparently. I think it's time to put the JET experiment to bed, hugely talented, but not a great attitude. I would like to see more of Morrison, but I don't know how that's going to play out. 

**Loans to come back** - Comley, Osman Kakay, Ben Gladwin, El Khayati - Don't know a lot about the youngsters, but could still come good, I would like to see Gladwin get another chance, but that's me and El Khayati should probably move on - JFH's man. There are a couple of other youngsters who I have no idea about. 


**OUT** - Caulker, Henry, Perch (maybe), Doughty, JET, El Khayati, Smithies (might be poached by Prem club).

**IN** - Backup CB, maybe sign LuaLua on a permanent, backup RB

I wouldn't tinker lots if we have consistent lineups we could be mid table, but I don't know if Ollie will do that. I am also a little fearful of what might happen in the transfer market after his comments in the last week or two. I don't think the club can go crazy spending wise yet, with FFP still not being resolved, but I would like to see us make a modest profit like last season if possible or get rid of Caulker's wages. It really depends on what the board decides the target is! But those are my two cents on the teams and players.",2017-05-11

It's a good question. I think it depends how we set up. But it must be useful having a left footed midfielder. I reckon on the left of someone like Luongo behind one of the wingers. Either way it's nice to have a fair amount of flexibility. ,2017-02-03
"I don't see him in an AM role, that will be for Freeman, Morrison.  He will likely play CM but interestingly he can also play CB.  One more thing about Goss is that he has a buy-back clause in his contract.",2017-02-03
"Great window IMO. Got some decent players in and some excess ones out.  Only worry is that we're still a little short in the back, Hall being injured means we're already down to our last two CBs (although im not sure if Caulker is still here or not?)

Here's what I think our best lineup will look like (with everyone healthy, also some of this is pure speculation)

GK: Smithies
RB: Furlong
CB: Onuoha and Lynch
LB: Bidwell
CDM: Luongo and Goss
CAM: Morrison
LW: Freeman
RW: Wszolek
ST: Smith

As I'm typing this up I'm realizing how many attacking options we have now.  The whole point of adding Smith was to play with two strikers, but who in that three man midfield gets dropped?  And thats still excluding Washington, Sylla, LuaLua, Mackie, Manning, and Yeni.  Definitely will be interesting to see what Holloway does.
",2017-02-01
"Overall, I agree with other posters, we have done pretty well. I may be in a minority, but I am really sad to see Shodipo leave, I genuinely would rather have him over LuaLua. But the big issue is that we are one more injury away from facing a defensive crisis. Having shifted Caulker ([on the way to Lokomotiv it seems](http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11711/10749926/ravel-morrison-set-to-join-qpr-as-steven-caulker-has-medical-at-lokomotiv-moscow-ahead-of-loan)), we have Lynch, Hall and Ned.

Others have called him a, ""one season wonder,"" and not being able to make the jump to a Championship calibre player.

I guess that'll be our task, rekindling the form of an out of favor player.  Without the luxury of deep pockets, these are the types of transfers we can expect.  More experienced than either Shodipo or El Khayati.  With Ngbakoto currently out of the team, Freeman is solid cover if either of our winners go down, and can also play an advanced midfield role.",2017-01-30

"I think that's a fair assessment. It'd be easier to figure out what we need if we knew what style we are trying to play. Sylla doesn't contribute much apart from his goals, so if he's up front (and I don't see what choice we have) then the key signings would be a defensive midfielder to make interceptions and launch counter-attacks via the wingers, and a number 10. If Goss lives up to expectations then he can distribute from the base of midfield, but we still need a ball-winner with experience. 

We're basically trying to play the same counter-attacking way we did under Warnock - solid in defence, strong on the flanks (Mackie, Routledge, Kyle Walker), a CM partnership of a ball-winner and a distributor (Derry and Faurlin) and a talented number 10 to exploit the space in the middle once the wingers have stretched the play (Taarabt). If that's what Holloway wants, then we need the ball-winner and the number 10. ",2017-01-29
"Let's get this straight.  We lost Sandro, Henry isn't playing and Cousins is out for a few months.  So we are left with just Luongo, Manning and Doughty as our center midfielders.  Manning is just 20 and while he's made a great start, will likely see a drop in form at some point.  Doughty, who we've just recalled, probably deserved a spot in the first team but was judged by JFH to not be of sufficient quality.

Now we've sent out Borysuik on loan, without first confirming personal terms with Goss.  This seems like a pretty haphazard move.  At least we are not losing him permanently. ",2017-01-26

I do remember the period he went through on the bench though, seemingly at odds with JFH and believing he was more important than the team.  Eventually JFH seemed to get him under control and in a run of form.  Holloway probably ran into the same issues but showed much less leniency towards that sort of attitude.

I've heard numerous reports that we made money on this transfer.  About time this thing finalized, unfortunate to have lost a goal scorer but if he doesn't match the team philosophy there is not much that can be said.",2017-01-24

"From http://www.transfermarkt.com/sebastian-polter/profil/spieler/60957 (unofficial) it looks like we sold him for a loss.  Now, Polter was here on a 3-year deal and works his socks off when on the pitch.  His obvious weakness was technical ability but made up for that with good hold-up play and getting onto headers in the box.  The only good reason for shipping Polter out was if we made money on his transfer.  If we didn't, well, I have to ask whether we are really that strapped for cash that we need to sell a player for a loss just to free up money to bring in someone else?  That is just bad business in my opinion.

Anyway, hard to know without official transfer figures.  Farewell Polter, did well for us while you were here.",2017-01-12

"First of all we start with [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84DvWBzGFjA). Definitely has some flair to his playing style, something we've been lacking.  Matched with his signature back flips he could be the spark our atmosphere needs.  Operates as a left winger which, as a result, means Shodipo and El Khayati are likely to see less of the pitch.  Worryingly he has only managed 43 minutes of game time this season, due to a knee injury that required surgery in September.  In fact since his introduction at Brighton six years ago he has rarely averaged more than a half on the pitch.  At Brighton he scored about one goal per ten games and his assist rate was worse than that.

Regardless, he likely comes into the team as our first-choice left winger.  He has a half decade of Championship experience and Holloway managed his brother at Blackpool so he may feel as though he knows what he is getting.  We are definitely a more right-sided team with the likes of Ngbakoto, Mackie and Wszolek so it is nice to see us add an experienced option on the left.  Although I believe we are in need of a central midfielder and a right back (and now a striker given the impending loss of Polter), I am excited by the prospect LuaLua offers.",2017-01-10

I'm a little sceptical of the reported Polter fee. I think McIntyre suggested it'd be a lot of money in add ons. Which makes sense considering who the buyer is. ,2017-01-09
"We'll either need to replace him, or get Sandro playing properly. Henry is a limited player but he's useful. Defensive midfield is not a position we're strong in, as yesterday's game illustrated. Cousins is poor off the ball and Ipswich found too much space in front of our defence. Ollie tried to fix it by bringing Ned on and moving Grant Hall to midfield, but having our best defender in midfield is not a proper solution. We've brought Doughty back from loan, but we will still need to bring in someone with experience to play there. 

Henry is much maligned but the truth is that quality players who can provide what he does are difficult to come by. You don't find a Shaun Derry every day. Henry is poor on the ball and he has a lot of technical shortcomings, but he's a bit underrated by our fans. The nature of his game means that he gets better in adversity, against superior opponents (in other words, when he doesn't have the opportunity to cock up our possession football). His best games for us were in the Prem. He has the ability to see where the opposition is looking most dangerous and apply himself there to bolster our most vulnerable area. That was notable in its absence yesterday, when during the first half Ipswich swarmed the right flank without Cousins or Manning doing much to stop it. You need a leader in that area to either put out the fire or organise those around him to do so. Cousins does a lot of shouting and pointing, but mainly just chases the ball around without any positional sense. ",2017-01-03

Luongo is definitely our best midfielder. Great piece of work to get him.  However if Sandro was playing it would be a different story.  If Holloway could get Sandro firing on all cylinders it might actually reignite his career.  He's already made more appearances for the club under Holloway than he has over the whole of last year.

"There is no excuse for a loss of this magnitude.  JFH got this one wrong, simply.  Our setup was too defensive and it just didn't work.  Henry has failed to perform in the midfield in the last three games, he should be an off the bench player at this stage.  If we can't play through the middle we'll never be successful.  What made it worse was having three new players in the squad who have yet to settle, playing against one of the best teams in the division.  There were a number of reasons the result came out this way, we can definitely recovery, but we are finally starting to drift into the pack and a win is becoming increasingly important.",2016-09-14

"I've taken points from video if you don't have time to watch. Hopefully this gives some insight. 

- Only missed out on one signing - won't mention who
- Yeni was first target - talks were complicated for various reasons - other clubs, people in his ear etc
- Sylla's a goal scorer, strong in the air, team player, more to his game - expect him to score a few
- Furlong - easy decision to loan him out, wanted him to make the step up but wasn't better currently than Perch or Ned
- Doughty - he's 23, was going to be one of 5 mids, couldn't be guaranteed first team football and wanted to go out on loan himself. Hoping he'll improve and he may be able to come back and challenge for a place next season. 
- Cole Kpekawa - Didn't want to lose him, but felt it was the best thing for his career. Got to the point ""you can bring a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"" - fitness/disciple issues. 
- Club doesn't publish transfer fee's to keep their spending close to their chest so agents etc can't take advantage
- Club has been working hard to reinstate right attitude/values through, work ethic, pride, etc throughout the club
- Les said we're looking for Professionalism from players
- Sandro - had issues when he first come back from Holiday, but has been working hard/good attitude every since. JFH's going to give him a chance provided he stays professional (which he has been doing). 

- Training Ground - only two residents have put in for judicial review. If it's rejected, they can move forward in four weeks. If it's granted the process can take 9 months to work through. LH feels confident we're nearly there - expected licence for work to be granted in 2-3 weeks. Judicial review is last hurdle. 
- Stadium - First huge win was planning permission for developing houses. It's a vital piece for us to move forward with the stadium. I Think this basically means that if we aren't granted the stadium permission, we'll pull our house development. 
- Car Giant - we've got planning permission so that's all we're concerned about. If there's an alternative, we'll look at that. 
- Redeveloping Loftus Road - LH said it's not possible due to size of land/area around. 
- Loftus Rd Facilities - location of Family stand - Only 399 season ticket holders misplaced from where family stand has gone. We've now got 1039 season ticket holders in the family stand. If we were to move them, he doesn't know where. 
- High percentage of season ticket holders are 50 and above, low percentage are below 40, so we need to work on the demographic to bring younger fans in. Wants to make club personal & about the fans. 
- Drinks prior to Kick Off - issue is regarding licencing. Can't drink within site of the pitch, can't drink within 10mins of kick off or 20mins before end of game. 
- LH Thinks that there are ways to do safe standing at games, but the FA have issues with it. Germany has standing sections that work well, but Europe, UEFA has rules in place to ensure everyone is seated. 
- Names on back of seats - right now we're not getting the basics at the stadium done (fixing toilets etc) so we want to focus on that. Not ruling it out, possibly have a premium section where ticket holders can pay a bit more to be able to offset the cost to the club.

- Club finances - have to tip your hats to the owners for turning the 160mil of debt into equity and taking the correct steps to sort out finances going fowrard.
- Fan base - 1993 Club finished 5th in PL, but average attendance was only 15,015. Our attendance is actually better now than back then. Praises those who have stuck by the club through thick and thin.
- Forever R's/Kick up the R's - chap got up and rambled for about 10 mins about giving money to previous club players. Lee Hoo's asked for him to provide figures (had apparently asked for this before), but the guy couldn't provide it. Some others asked the guy to wrap it up, Lee tried to talk to everyone about hearing him out/respecting one another, the guy then cut him off with some back handed comments. Rambled some more then asked for Lee to come back to him. 
- JFH - Would we be happy with a top 6 finish - Jimmy replied he always wants more. If we're up to the PL standard now -We're not good enough for the PL as we're in the championship. 
- Cousins - JFH see's him in the middle of the park. Playing on the right because of circumstances and because he's versatile. 
- LH - Horrible fence at Stadium - Council do not want people to be able to go into that end. He's working on it. Council issue is the migration between stands. 
- Away fans tickets different colour - looking to do this going forward, already had stack of old tickets we had to get rid of. 
- Away fixtures (Newcastle then Blackburn) looking at options about whether the team comes back or stays up North. Football league trying to eliminate mid-week fixtures altogether. The club can't do anything about the long distance trips. 
- Grassroots football - no scouts at their games etc but other clubs are there. Les - We're trying to improve our scouting within London.
- Names on seats - old badge was taken off so people who had names on their seats were taken off at the same time. 
- Atmosphere - club can't really influence this. LH referenced Palarse Ultras section and how they had limitations put on them by the club. He's happy to listen to suggestions if people think there's something that will improve the atmosphere. LH wondered if people who were relocated from the Lower Loft would be happy going into the upper loft (where there are mainly non-season ticket holders) to try and raise the atmosphere up there. 
- Les mentioned that the fans energise the players - this has changed since he was playing as people come to games expecting to being entertained. 
- JFH - emphasized the importance of fans supporting ALL the players, especially the young kids - they need the extra support. 
- Disabled supporters - coach tickets for carers were taken away. LH said he'll look into it. QPR way below wheelchair seating compared to other clubs - LH will look into it.
- LH's is disappointed people have contacted the club and no-one's got back to him. 
- Players brought in have to compete for places - not just brought in as cover. 
- JFH asked if he regrets joining as he looks more stressed. He said he tries to stay as calm/enjoy the game as much as possible - but it's a bigger club etc so there are different expectations from Burton.
- Yeni - can play right/left and striker. Depends match by match where he'll' play. 

- LH pleased with all the photos everyone sent in for redo-ing the tunnel. ",2016-09-07
"Just to add a bit more to this (as I'm bored at work at lunchtime...)

**Attack**

We are yet to score a goal from open play, with 4 goals coming from set pieces and 4 from penalties. 

We also are last in the league in crosses per game (15), which, with Polter as our starting #9 I thought wouldn't be the case, although he does seem to be a lot better with the ball at his feet than he might at first appear. To compensate though, we're fifth in long balls per game (84) which is when we pump the ball up to Polter so he can get our midfielders involved. 

We seem to favour attacking down the right side slightly more than the left (41%-37%), with a much lower preferences for the middle (21%  of attacks). I think this ties in well to the way in which we have fluid wingers and attackers, Chery being an exampe who likes to roam the pitch. However, interestingly, the majority of our shot attempts come from the middle (59%) rather than any other side, but that does put us near the bottom (18th out of 24). 
We are dead in the middle of the table for where our shots come from, with 5% of shots coming in the 6 yard box, 52% in the 18 yard box and 43% from outside, placing us 12th, 12th and 11th compared to other championship sides. 

**Defence**

Another interesting tidbit, we're currently 4th in the league in the amount of yellow cards we have conceded with 9 and an extra 4 listed as 'other' (I assume this is timewasting). Although we are 21st in the amount of fouls we give away, 10.2 a match, which is interesting considering the amount of yellows we then receive! 

As we seem to be a lot better at set pieces, we also have a very god CB pairing and are getting more sound defensively. We are currently 4th in the league in aerial duels won per match at 24.4 (Ipswich are top with 35.6) which stands is in good stead moving forward. What is also interesting, is that we have concede a fair few goals from shots on target, currently we only make 1 save per game... putting us dead last in the division. 

**Conclusion**

I think the picture we get is that we are a tight unit at the back, with two CBs good in the air and a settled holding midfield pairing to protect them in Henry and Luongo. We seem to be a lot lot better at set pieces, both in attack and defending them, which is a welcome change. with the midfield that we have, I think it's only a matter of time until we start scoring from open play, and putting that ball in the box for Polter may be the way to do that now. We have a very fluid attacking midfield and with the additions of Sylla, Wszolek and N'Gbakoto  with Chery could stand is in very good stead. Neddie is the 7th best ranked defensive player in the league with Caulker in 13th and if they can keep up their early season form, we should be a very very tough team to beat. That's enough rambling from me!

"The family section is in the lower loft. I'd try and sit either side of the goal, since if you're directly behind it you'll be looking through the net for the whole game. I'd say J or H block (lower) - that way you'll be in the corner that gets the most sunshine, and the substitutes warm up in that corner which gives the kids something to look at if the action is up at the other end. It's also furthest from the Q Block, so it's a bit less sweary.

If the kids are young it's nice for them to be near the front since the mascots hang around there before and after the game (and at half-time), but beware that the very front rows might get wet if it rains (the forecast is good for the weekend, but you never know).

I have to say I disagree with him here. I think we need to be more prudent, and more pressing than a striker is some more cover on the wings.

"[The last accounts Newcastle filed had them in profit](http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2016/04/15/newcastle-united-profit-reduced-wage-bill/), with a wage bill of £57m. Last season they bagged £72m from the Premier League before sponsorship and gate receipts. Unless Ashley is an idiot, they shouldn't go into next season in any kind of catastrophic situation where they're leaking cash they don't have.

[According to this article on parachute payments](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/how-much-aston-villa-parachute-11161706), Toon and Villa are lined up for £40m, £33m and £14m over the next three years. Norwich only get the first two as they yo-yo'd.

[Newcastle's average attendance last time round in this division](http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attnclub/newu.htm) was  43,388. Compare that to QPR's 15,994. Multiply each of those figures by 23, and you'll find that over a season they get 630k more bums on seats than QPR. At this level that's a significant financial advantage.

So large gate receipts, large parachute payment, not so much degenerate over-spending like QPR of yesteryear. Newcastle shouldn't have to stress about FFP for a while, and certainly not this season. Woe betide any club that enters a transfer duel over a player with them in this window.",2016-06-01
Just speculating but perhaps it has something to do with revenue vs costs? With the size of their stadium and parachute payments they should be fine for a few years at least. ,2016-06-01
Just reading up on him. Would be an interesting buy. Seems like he had some trouble finding his feet in England when he was young but had a lot of promise.

"I don't think it was a question of good enough, wasn't it that Redknapp wanted to play 3-5-2 cause he'd seen it at the World Cup (the Dutch) and he got in Mauricio Isla (natural position) - (same reason he got in Fer and Vargas - as they play the 3-5-2 formation at international level) and he didn't think that Danny could handle the switch.

I think those first few months of playing that weird formation is what sealed the deal for the relegation. ",2016-05-20
Danny was a great RB for us and one of our best in our promotion campaign.  Transferring him away was a huge mistake by the club.,2016-05-20

"Even though he hasn't scored for us, gaining experience at the international level will definitely help him develop as a player.",2016-05-19
"Newcastle are a shoo-in - they will blow everything and risk everything in order to get promoted next year. If they don't get promoted it could spell doom. Rafa is used to the Premier League and TBH the championship is a different kind of football so if he doesn't adjust quickly it could be a problem. But they will definitely have some of the best players in the league (although to be fair they didn't perform in the Premier League so what motivation will they have for the championship). They don't seem to have anyone except for Jamaal Lascelles who has any steel.

From what I'm looking at right now I think Villa will either be a mid-table team next season or do a blackpool and go straight down again. None of the players on their books at the moment (except maybe Jordan Ayew) are players that I rate or have experience of the championship.

Norwich will be fine but I don't expect them to go straight up next year - as with us going up and down (and up again) can be draining for the mentality of the players and I think they will look to have a settling year like us.",2016-05-19

I would say he's still a season or so away from a first team spot at least. I thought Doughty might of been able to break through a bit more this season but his prospects under JFH look bleak.

"I would be surprised but he'd be lucky to get a move this quickly as another club would have to at least match the suppose £1.5m we spent on him (cause it's not like we are looking to sell) and someone would have to be looking for a keeper - you normally see clubs sticking with their main keeper unless he's been shocking for 10 games or something.

He's been okay this season but nothing incredible (in fact I don't even think he's going to keep Matt Ingram out of a starting place next season).",2016-05-12

GK- Green
Defense- Dunne, Hill, BAE

Some of our managers have looked dreadful at the time, but seem half-way decent in retrospect once others have come in and failed even more spectacularly. ",2016-04-06
"He's blessed with finally being able to pick squads that don't feature some of the overpriced 'Premier League' level talent left over from last season. He's also got to steer a QPR at long last not relying on Austin's poaching to score goals. He still needs a pre-season to get everyone prepared to a level he's happy with and to shuffle personnel as he wants himself.

In my eyes he dropped the ball tactically twice and we were badly overrun in midfield, including in a disastrous home match against Fulham. Hopefully they were just isolated events though - prior to last night's draw, our ten match stretch under him was actually 6th best in the division.",2016-04-06
"To be honest I think he's not doing too bad, definitely seems to be an improvement over Ramsey. Next season when he has a full window to bring in his own players will probably be the real test and that's when we'll probably have a better idea of whether he can steer us back towards the premier league",2016-04-06
"He will end up being one of our most successful managers. He has had to start from ground zero. Get players motivated and working hard. Be hard to beat. Don't get over excited after a win. Don't be ridiculous after a loss. Don't be a dick in general. After the window he should have his own foundation and a decent group of players. We will challenge for a promotion spot next season and get promoted the one after. Unless of course it rains shit from the sky or some other QPR madness happens, which it probably will. ",2016-04-06

No they don't, but they do it with a football club and that's very weird (meaning unique) because they feel a sense of ownership of a football club and that's a really difficult balance of how you try and engage with fans and make them, incorporated into some of the decisions of the club, {…}

Much like a few other players on the squad, they are paying a guy a lot of money to do nothing.  It's not like this was part of the long term plan but clearly a massive mis-step in the process.

There was a lot of League 1 in the QPR team, with Luongo, Washington and El-Khayati. I dunno, maybe JFH thought that it was worth resting others for Derby tomorrow? You'd hope something like that line of thinking was at play, because otherwise you'd start to worry that JFH has some tactical lessons to learn. Interestingly enough Brentford plucked their manager from another high flying League One team and a lot of them seem to be bemoaning his tactics as well. I think the further down the league pyramid you go, the more sheer grit, workrate and desire come into play to influence outcomes. 

Sounds like the reshuffle in defense was unwelcome news indeed. Nonetheless the highlights seemed to show a few reasonable attempts at goal and if just one of them had gone in maybe the match could have ended differently. Sounds like this was no dominant display though.",2016-03-06

">what is the area like in terms of demographics (race, gender, ethnicity) and how has it changed in the past couple of years?

Here are some stats from three of the local government entities - [Hammersmith & Fulham](http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Images/14_62ds_71424_councillors-induction_10-borough_profile_rev5_tcm21-188745.pdf), [Ealing](http://ealing.cmis.uk.com/Ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=cEIfTAXlsDc5CN%2Fg5kXx1fVb6GGHzc%2BHywVMRbg9J%2BdrwxW1wjX5JA%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) and [Brent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Brent#Demographics). You're looking at about 50% white people (which doesn't always mean White British). To my eyes QPR's support simply hasn't kept up with this trend, and if you want to get a taste of what the area used to be like, maybe watch the film [Quadrophenia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079766/locations), which is set in the area in the '60s. Like most clubs outside the top 4 or 5, QPR has a problem with aging support, and this film is more reflective of the world a lot of the people who sit around me come from.

Some family friends used to look after me a lot as a kid and I remember they always used to frequent a golf club and the Conservative Club (as in the political party). While they might have been genuinely interested in these things, they essentially used them as places to hang out and drink. QPR strikes me as being a bit like this - people don't necessarily turn up as a matter of civic pride in their local community any more. I don't think many supporters live immediately local these days - Shepherd's Bush was a bit of a shithole and as suburbs sprung up, people generally got out. These days it's a typical inner-London mix - a lot of rented accommodation, some government housing (including a huge swathe of social housing right next to QPR) and absolutely obscene gentrification. There isn't really a large pool of your average joe-types to entice into coming down to QPR. As the older generation of fans dies off, I can't see where they'll be replaced to be honest, and I'm not sure their kids will be bothered about spending time and money travelling in - often from pretty far out - to watch.

Mostly working class or middle class nowadays, the fans tend to be dedicated and not glory hunters (because there ain't much glory to hunt here atm). I would say that they are more dedicated than the average fan because there are a lot of London clubs in all divisions of the FL (and PL) so it's not like you are a QPR fan just cause you were born in London (unlike say Hull fans and Hull).

I grew up in North-London but became a QPR fan when I started going to the games when I was younger. Early 30s now was a season-ticket holder for a few years but have moved away and takes about 2-3 hours to get down now so I only go when I am visiting family now.",2016-02-20

The young players we've picked up over the last year have the potential to be great in the future (Grant Hall, Conor Washington, Luongo, Ingram, Robinson (I know we picked him up earlier),  Smithies & Polter).

This window was used as an opportunity to correct expectations, shrink the squad accordingly, reduce the wage bill and allow for younger players to cement there name in the first XI. I think we could have done with getting Green out of there, and signing a RB. But otherwise this is what I expected from the club and i'm happy with how things turned out. ",2016-02-02
"Financially I think they done quite well. They've essentially halved the burden of two premier league salaries over the season with the Fer and Sandro loans.

From a playing perspective they've also cleared up some of the selection headaches, as they have shifted three big names there. I'm a bit disappointed they didn't cash in on Phillips but it sounds like the WBA and Watford financials didn't end up making that deal possible. Also Green...damn.

I would have liked them to find a box-to-box midfielder from somewhere. A more natural rightback would have been welcome too. Chery seems the most logical number 10 now, but the team will suffer in aerial duels with him involved.

Washington looks like we finally have a striker with legs though.",2016-02-02
"Losing Remy to the Chelsea bench of all places really strikes me as one of those ""what could have been"" moments.  If Remy had stayed, he and Charlie would have flourished.  I really will remember it as a decision that had a serious impact in the club's future.",2016-02-02
"Redknapp is absolutely right. He has gone from a legitimate goal scoring threat in the PL, to an after thought. I'm not saying he should have stayed at QPR, but he could have found stability and improvement at a mid table team or even for a europa league team. ",2016-02-02
Hopefully other players wanting to do something similar will see this.,2016-02-02
Remy is a mercenary and I doubt he'll be remembered too much by any of his former clubs. Hopefully the rise of the financial clout of leagues like China will draw these types out of the pool.,2016-02-02
"Not going to lie, kind of happy to see him go.  I can't wait to see anyone else in the CAM role.  Another one who could've used the same determination and tenacity as Polter.  What a threat he would be.  Similar to JET, maybe he can regain some form out on a loan.",2016-02-01

"I agree with your selection.

While Konchesky tries 100%, he's now too easily beaten with pace down that wing; so he's likely going to make a reasonable centreback, somewhere.

Philips keeps underperforming, or perhaps,  that's it; that's really as good as he gets.

I've not been on the anti-Henry bandwagon. Yesterday's game changed my mind. At times, he looks clueless, when he wasn't even under pressure. No excuses for that. He's just not good enough.


Most of all: I don't want to see anymore hoofing of the ball up the pitch. I'm fed up with it. It's Sunday league football; not something I want to pay to watch.

In yesterday's 2nd half, for the first time ever, I considered walking out of the stadium during the game. Getting to the point where I can't take watching anymore of this.


Now they want us to renew our season tickets in March, or we'll be penalised. I may not renew.

I'm not paying £465-500 pa to watch Sunday league football. 
",2016-01-24
"I agree with most of that. At this point I'd be thinking about the financial side of things - maximise on fees wherever possible and shift high earners. The books simply have to be balanced. Unfortunately we aren't living in an ideal world and the only fee I can imagine is for Phillips, and I'd be happy if they got the same price they paid for him at this stage. Beyond him you're looking at the high earners, and I make assumptions on their salary based on when they signed. Sandro, Fer, Green, Traoré, Hoilett and Diakité. I think the latter four will see their contracts run down this year, so I'm doubtful about moving them out.

Edit: And I'll break ranks on the Austin love-in. They should have made more effort to move him in the summer. Charlie Austin primarily looked out for himself. From interviews and journos it seems that he was the one who didn't accept the offers on the table. He was the one who didn't sign a new contract in the middle of last season. QPR lost out on millions that mean a lot more in the Championship. Finally...I think his appearance yesterday puts his last few absences for QPR in a slightly darker light. There's the big transfer failure for 15/16, and it was partially out of the club's hands. In the pantheon of QPR heroes, there are currently three still on the books who are more prominent than Charlie Austin.",2016-01-24
"My biggest complaints are with Karl Henry, Leroy Fer and at times Konch, everyone else they're doing okay, I'm seriously baffled as to how Karl Henry still manages to get game time, he costs us at LEAST a point a game through him either losing the ball, misplacing a pass or not marking someone, it's just nonsensical.",2016-01-24
"Mackie, Samba ... Don't really see the need to offload many players to be honest. Wish Traore and Yun could get more game time.",2016-01-24

"I hope he scores LOADS of goals in the Premier League. 

I want the elite clubs to be shown up as ignorant and elitist when it comes to recruiting from the lower leagues. 

Charlie scored 15 during his season in the PL, despite playing for QPR and being out injured for a part of that season.",2016-01-23
Let's hope he scores lots against Chelsea and Palarse! Happy for the lad,2016-01-23
:(,2016-01-23
"I think thats quite harsh. Chery had to backtrack and shoot around his body. He was unfortunate not to knock the ball 4cm to the right.

They had very little chances. Le Fondre did nothing all game and their only real threat was La Parre, of which is faster and more agile than Konch. Yun would have been perfect.

> Relegation form

What are you on about buddy? Relegation form? You must be new. Relegation form is what we have been in whenever we make it to the prem. We are by no means relegation form.",2016-01-23
"Just back. The more I replay the game in my head the angrier I get, and I wasn't anticipating getting worked up over the result today no matter how it went.

For me it was the shocking central midfield that got me wound up. It was like there was a black hole in the middle of the QPR shape. Fer was really poor today, honestly time and time again he mistimed his jumps and just never looked dangerous on the ball. Luongo - dear oh dear oh dear - I've been anxious for him to come back into the squad but apart from one move in the first half he just looked out of it, and to me it looked like his confidence was undone towards the closing period of the match. I think these two performances made Henry look worse, who was after all just Karl Henry.

Phillips just doesn't look hungry enough for this level to me, and any scouts watching him would surely have been more impressed by van La Parra, who in turn was probably flattered by our achilles heel left flank. Konchesky. For fuck's sake. The other thing that got boring very quickly was the goal kick up to Hoilett.

Harry Arseknapp's ghost lives on in Sandro's contributions. This was the kind of game where we could have really used his skill set, but naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah the multi-million pound man has other things to entertain himself with.

I make that 4 points that Chery has cost us with fluffed shots this year. I won't judge him as harshly though as he can't get consistent game time.

On the plus side - Smithies, Hall, Polter and maybe even Washington. Looks like some good business here under the new regime. The latter must have wanted to strangle Chery. Lovely first touch,  although it's far to early to be proclaiming a new pope. I'd be so tempted to switch to 4-4-2, but I'm not sure they've got the right set of players to put in the middle.",2016-01-23
"Our biggest problem is that all of the 'big' players are generally useless at tracking back. Konchesky got eaten alive and the only player willing to get stuck in to help was Polter. Phillips and Fer should be shifted, but the club will take a huge hit on them. And Jack Robinson cannot get back to fitness any sooner. There was a total lack of desire in the team in the second half, like always, we struggled against a hard working side. Classic Rangers. I do not envy JFH's job in the slightest, he will be fighting an uphill battle for a long time yet. ",2016-01-23

"If I'm honest I've never heard of him but scored 15 goals in League 1 this season and he's young and British (which is the kind of signing we should be targeting).

Edit: And if these rumours of Watford interest in Phillips are true, we'll be one more player short on the wings. Hoilett, Mackie, Petrasso, JET, with possible cameos from Yun?",2016-01-19

This is a story from November.,2016-01-02
"I agree that anyone calling for JFH's head after less than 10 matches is a lunatic, but unfortunately they exist in abundance among QPR support and I fear we'll end up with the doomed club the more rabid sections of P, Q and R blocks are calling for.

I also agree on Luongo. t's really depressing that he can't get in the squad.

I think calling Polter rubbish and Smithies unconvincing based on 336 and 107 match minutes respectively, especially when the former has racked up two goals and an assist over the last two weeks, is harsh. In Polter's case, [this sums up best how I feel about it](http://loftforwords.fansnetwork.co.uk/forum/161714/page:2/#47):

>Polter is an interesting example of how the dynamic of the crowd and the support has changed at Loftus Road. Previously we absolutely reveled in having those unconventional, underdog players in our team. Maybe not technically the best, maybe a bit odd to watch, maybe a bit of a maverick, but 110% effort, totally committed and effective. We used to absolutely love somebody like that and make cult heroes of them. Jamie Mackie, Devon White, Danny Shittu, Stuart Wardley maybe, Rufus Brevett maybe. 

>Now we absolutely pummel Polter, even when he's doing a good job for the team and both scoring and setting up goals regularly, presumably because we think we as a club should be above that, and should be out there spending more money on accomplished strikers and big names - like that's worked at all for us over the past five years. I know some on here get their hackles up at the word ""spoilt"" when it's been used about the supporters this season, but we've certainly changed as a group of fans.

He won a few headers, got physically stuck in regardless of the outcome, and won a few fouls. Playing at the top of the pitch, his mistakes aren't going to be punished as harshly as, say, Fer's, Onuoha's or Green's were. If you really want to start crucifying people for no end product in the final third, redirect your anger towards Hoilett, Fer and Phillips, all of whom almost certainly do it at far greater cost to the club.

As for the signings, Gayle aint coming to a lower half Championship team. Your defender would have to play third fiddle behind Onuoha and Hall. Signing Bentley would be farcical given that the only things that have changed since we last tried to sign him are we signed someone else and we no longer have any hope of promotion.

Bradshaw looks promising, but he's being linked to a lot of other clubs already. He would definitely address a need. Other than the rightback spot - where they seem to be going in on the cheap with Motta - an extra striker is the only position I think they should address, given Austin is gone by June.",2016-01-02
"> get a striker in (Dwight Gayle?)

Ironically, I've bought Gayle on Football Manager after selling Charlie to Watford for £12m in preseason.

We're 16th, just lost to Brentford and I'm about to get the sack. Scarily accurate game.",2016-01-02
"Junior Hoilett has been Junior Hoilett. He can run quite fast, often into a deadend, can't reliably cross the ball, and will work pretty hard to retrieve balls that he loses, often physically to the point he draws a foul. I'm pleased he finally committed himself to Canada, as it will benefit his overall game and give him a few more career goals. Not a bad player but not a world beater. Should do well for Canada against the likes of Nicaragua and El Salvador and hopefully can help them get that third CONCACAF spot. I wish him well in his future endevours, as I don't believe they will be here at QPR.

Edit: [Here are some more opinions...](http://loftforwords.fansnetwork.co.uk/forum/161716/hoillett/#8)",2016-01-01
"He has been nothing short of rubbish for most of his stay at QPR. He was ""the next big thing"" when he joined from Blackburn, but has never properly delivered. He's had his moments, I remember the start of the 13/14 season, he was brilliant in the season opener, assisted Onuohas goal and so unlucky not to score, but got his goal in the next game vs. Huddersfield. And then he got injured. That's pretty much just repeated itself. He's very predictable, opponents who have done their homework (which on this level is most players) can read him like a wide open book.

Tbf he has done quite well as of recently, but I still see no future for him at QPR when his contract expires at the end of the season. Tbh, I would want him to find his way out this transfer window, his wage is just too big",2016-01-01
"I predict very little business in the window. In one of the interviews with JFH or Ferdinand on QPR player a few weeks back they said they're looking to trim the squad size down from something like 28 to 22. If we're lucky Fer might get his move to Sunderland. Can't see Austin ducking out of his summer sign on fee elsewhere. Other players just don't look good enough and are probably not going to get their deals at QPR matched at other clubs.

If Fer goes maybe they'll make a modest signing, one of JFHs old boys perhaps. I don't think there's any real money available otherwise. Sounds like we'll get this Motta guy, giving us an ex-Watford trio. That's fair enough, as the way things are playing out right back is the only selection problem the managers are having.",2015-12-30
The problem with Henry is that if we sold him the only midfielder we have left at the club who is capable of putting himself about a bit is Sandro and his injury problems are well documented.,2015-12-30
I wouldn't sell Austin because in all honesty I'm worried we might get relegated without him which we can't afford to do. Agree with the other sales and buys.,2015-12-30
"Agree with selling Austin, but he also said in the on-pitch post match interview not long ago he was staying till the end of the season. Would still see a striker be signed though, Dwight Gayle as you suggest, but also Tom Bradshaw. Dwight Gayle will be seeking regular football, but Tom Bradshaw might be more suited for second choice, and as he's despite being a League One player already a full senior Wales international, he will want to impress in order to join Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey on the flight to France.",2015-12-30
"Agree on a lot of your points. I would love to see Luongo, Doughty, even Gladwin back in the mix. We have hungry young players, why not play them instead of the older players who we know can't cut it in the Prem?",2015-12-30
"The only way any of these players go during this window is if management decides to stop pursuing promotion, and knowing uncle Tony, I doubt it. ",2015-12-30
[deleted],2015-12-28
"I don't know why JET or Polter didn't start, I really can't think of any good reason.  Angella was rightfully dropped from the side to accommodate Hill, who was playing exceptionally well earlier in the season.  Sandro reappeared in the starting XI and has been playing well as of late. Unfortunately Faurlin did not play, perhaps the compact schedule is affecting him.  Tozser was not the correct replacement.  Henry is not going to win us any games.  Fer underperformed once again.  JFH has to understand this and truly seek out his best XI.  Luongo, Chery, even Doughty have shown glimpses of what they can bring to the club and are not getting the chances they deserve.  Even Yun sits idly by on the bench.

We have the talent to pull it together in my opinion, we haven't been losing matches and I believe that JFH will be able to get us firing.",2015-12-28
"I kind of perceive this as a three pronged issue.

Firstly, the most obvious issue, is the performances themselves. Season after season now we're seeing similar issues - over-reliance on one man getting goals, poor patterns of play with little clever instances of moving the ball forward, a stubborn refusal to cross the ball and an infuriating knack for conceding late goals. On top of all this, the club  constantly seems to fall back into this position of playing their most seasoned, highly paid players even when they don't seem to form an effective, cohesive unit. Yesterday underlined all of these points.. Regardless of the point gained, it was so, so poor...honestly one of the worst performances I can remember. I'm not sure on what dimensional plain it is logical to rotate Karl Henry between right winger and number 10, but it seems I'm living there. I can only really remember two spells where it seemed they were bucking this trend - for a stretch in the first half of last season Vargas and Isla were clicking well, and we moved the ball nicely down the right wing, and in the early part of this season, when Luongo and Chery were involved and we were unlocking opposition defenses and scoring goals, while admittedly shipping them as well. It seems Vargas and Isla were horribly handled though, in common with a long list of other players over the past few years. Mackie, Faurlin, Simpson, McCarthy, Mutch, Vargas, Isla, Yun, Diakité, Doughty, and number of young players...I'm sure you can all add a few names. You can't mess players around to this degree and expect to positively develop the product on the pitch. I'm getting sick of it, and it's becoming tough to get behind the 11 guys on the pitch when season after season the characters who kick off in August aren't those starting a few months later.

The management of the club is another issue. Would Fernandes and his pals have bought QPR if it wasn't a Premier League club? Has he ever had a solid plan for what to do with QPR as a non-PL club? The Tune Group tenure has seen a lot of unexpected twists and turns - if they had had to deal with relegation in 11/12 maybe they would have learned some valuable lessons sooner. If the Redknapp Championship squad didn't fluke promotion, they might have started a solid rebuild earlier (Ephraim mentioned Redknapp was a cert for the exit prior to Wembley). They have had an uncontrollable, unpredictable animal in QPR which they have left others to handle from a distance, and christ knows under Beard and Redknapp and whatever forces were at work in the dressing room things went from bad to worse. I had hoped that Ferdinand and Hoos coming in and making the right noises would have us in a happier place now, but I'm sceptical based on what I see week in week out. There seems to be a lack of backbone, courage and discipline. I don't see a lot of conviction and willingness to stand their ground in the face of dressing room egos and rabid fans. I think they also showed a lot of weakness in dealing with the assets that the club had over the summer. Sometimes you need to drop the asking price as a seller. Sometimes you need to be more proactive to force through the sale. I suspected that Austin and Phillips should have been cashed in. I think my hunch was right. As well as reaping a financial benefit (which we now won't see), the squad selection would be simpler. Throughout the Fernandes era, I suspect the only player we've possibly seen a profit on is Remy. After four years, I've still yet to see evidence that they know how to handle the football market.

Lastly...the supporters themselves. You can't condemn them entirely for baring their fangs after a few years of absolute abuse from many elements of the club, but it seems they've reached this level of baseline discontent where some really poisonous voices are able to make themselves heard much more easily. There's always a witch hunt on. Fer seems to be the latest victim, and he was booed off the pitch yesterday. He's been most anonymous and shit, but to be derided as he ran off? He's not here because he bleeds blue and white, we all know that, but he hasn't pissed on the badge. Karl Henry. Traoré. Mbia. There seems to always need to be one of the starting 11 that people can line up in the crosshairs. Apparently Ferdinand was berated by an older suppporter at Loftus Road yesterday about Leroy Fer, to which Les replied it was a confidence thing. If that is the case, how is throowing him a sea of wanker signs as he hits the bench going to help? And then of course there was the whole furore around Ramsey, which has been well covered. It must be a shit atmosphere to play in, and it's certainly often a shit atmosphere to attend as a supporter. In a lot of ways QPR reminds me of the pub I used to get dragged to by a babysitters family back in the day, just off Hanger Lane, that no longer exists. A collection of familiar faces getting together for a drink and a good time. It's a double edged sword, because for all the charm, character and continuity that brings, it becomes very hard to evolve it in to something more contemporary without maintaining all of that and pissing off the traditional core. Maybe it's just the curse of modern football hitting home. Head over to Twitter and behold the timeline of Steve Gallen's axing - seemingly confirmed by Kevin Gallen - to witness how this plays out in the real world.",2015-12-28
"Part of me thinks the line-ups at the moment are part of the management's strategy to offload the players that we can/would like to sell in January. Ideally JFH will then be able to get his own players in with the funds, which is what Les & Co were hoping to achieve with more success in August.",2015-12-28
"We've been shit ever since the Malaysians came in. The last lot may have been wankers but they improved the ground, actually improved Harrington as much as possible (remember we don't own it), left us with no debt and in the Prem with Neil. Wankers? Yes. Successful on and off the pitch? Certainly.",2015-12-28
"Had Austin left in the summer we would've been screwed this season, shows how much we miss him.",2015-12-28
"It seems like there is still mass confusion between the board, coaching, players and supporters.

Like many here, I do not understand the line-ups over the last 10 games or so.  Regarding JFH, it seems like he is using all the players he has to get a feel for who goes and who stays in the long term.  

To me, the biggest mistake this season was not selling Austin.  Just poor asset management.  Buy low and sell high and the club screwed that up.  Now you sell him for peanuts (maybe make some money off the transfer based on what they paid for him) or worse yet, he leaves for nothing at the end of the season.  

",2015-12-28
No idea why the hell both Warnock and now JFH seem to think Phillips can play as a striker? Baffling tactics yesterday. ,2015-12-28
"I was there and I am fully behind Jimmy.. BUT it was a rubbish team selection that put in a rubbish performance at the end of the day. Watching Warnock's line up again, this time against Huddersfield at home was beyond belief. Two wingers up front and no strikers, in a game we should walk away with, seriously? From the sideline you could see our structure on the pitch was a shambles with everyone out of position. Nothing has changed for 4 or 5 games now, change something Jimmy for crying out loud!!

"> “I feel very strong and happy now, and we’re going to grow with the new coach and his mentality,” he said.

To be very frank, I couldn't give a monkey's about the mindset of our players.

I appreciate players have to respond to press questions, but they often sound like sheltered teenagers (no disrespect to any younger hoops fans).

When it comes to these statements I often ask myself, what would Shaun Derry say? 

Shaun saw it as his personal responsibility to be 100% motivated at all times. He never needed a parental figure to motivate him.

It's the difference between men and boys.",2015-12-23
"> Rangers were fortunate to find Burnley flat footed in the fifty-third minute when Onuoha, correctly, allowed a ball to bounce in behind him expecting his goalkeeper to come and claim only to find Green, not for the first time this season, glued to his line, motionless, apparently thinking about other things. Thankfully he'd returned to us two minutes later and was sharply out to save at Gray's feet on the edge of the box. Still, another concerning performance, peppered with wild kicking for which the strong wind would have been an excuse had Tom Heaton at the other end not been so completely untroubled by the conditions. 

I am really worried that Green keeps his place in goal, regardless of which manager we have. Maybe it's his locker room presence - he seems a model professional, however, his kicking is so poor and he seems to make a hash of something at least once a game. 

Also this was a big take away from the Burnley game, and it will be interesting to see how JFH mixes it up to keep things fresh, I really want to see Luongo in for Fer and for Charlie to be starting too. 

> But for them to be hanging out of their arses to quite this extent, quite so early in a Championship match, was alarming.

I agree with you and stability is incredibly important so I would be content with a mid table finish this year. But obviously I want promotion.

Promotion is the reason you play the game so yes I want it but I'd be fine without it. ,2015-12-04
"I'm torn on this at times.  As someone who lives in Canada, the only way I can see my club is if they are in the Premier League.  However what is best for the club is it not to make the jump just yet.  At least in my view.  We do not have the squad that could survive more than one season.

I would love another season to build in the Championship with these players, make very minimal changes to the line up and build the youth.  As I have said before, the biggest question mark is Austin.  We need to make a decision on him now.  It is awful asset management if he walks for nothing.  If he is going to leave at the end of the season then it is vital you get something for him now.  ",2015-12-04
"Agreed. At the end of last season, many thought the same thing--take a couple years in the lower leagues to consolidate.

Warnock seems to understand this, that is important.

I was excited by our game vs Leeds, we were able to create a lot of chances and the pace of Phillips, Chery, Hoilett and Austin made us dangerous in the attacking third.  In fact, I was impressed with Hoilett's play.  His recent international caps could be having a positive impact on his form.

Our back four is settled in Perch, Onuoha, Hall and Konchesky.  Our defensive midfielders also appear settled now as well, which is hugely important to the stability and shape of the team.

"We'll see what the longer term ideas any potential new manager brings, I guess? If it's Warnock I assume the 4-2-3-1 will be retained. How rigidly they stick to it, I guess depends on the new guy's priorities. I was shocked at how uniform Preston were on Saturday, for instance. Ramsey (pbuh) on the other hand in one of  his early season interviews alluded to the fact that he preferred a more fluid type of game plan where the numbers meant a little less.

One of the things that really stands out for me on Saturday is that only 2 of the 11 starters were new this season. As mentioned elsewhere, 5 of the supposed superstars were on the pitch at kick-off. They failed, at home against a newly promoted team. No wonder they were relegated. Watching it, I couldn't help but think that this was a team essentially welded together with money, not team spirit.

I imagine Perch will be straight back in. At the end of the day I think playing in a position like full back involves a lot of instinct developed through extensive training and match time with the touchline to one side. A getaway driver speeding away from 100 bankraids in London would probably not be as effective on the 101st if it was in Paris, with the flipped steering wheel and road orientation.

I think Chery on the left and Luongo through the middle is a legit option, and I was a bit dismayed to see this dropped on Saturday. I really would have liked to have watched a Gladwin - Luongo - Chery trio playing behind JET, and had they offloaded the Holy Trinity I think we might have been treated to it. I guess Chery would be more suited to a central role, but despite his tendency to disappear from matches I think he's shown occasional glances of brilliance, such as the Bolton strike.

I'm with you on Hoilett. Can't ever imagine him as more than an impact sub. He looked OK on Saturday, but nothing new there, he always flatters to deceive. Still a few months to prove me wrong I guess. If he does need some hand-holding, Warnock might be the man to do it.

Sandro is Redknapp's last laugh. I still think Tozser might come good in rotation with Faurlin. Short of dropping Luongo back, I'm not sure who you partner them with though. I think Fer is a little one dimensional, but maybe he's still working his way back to fitness.

I wouldn't be surprised if Doughty, Yun and Polter try to jump ship in January, and I wouldn't blame them. It's a shame, because I think throwing together supposedly inferior players to capped internationals and players pocketing a million or two a year is more likely to forge a better team. David Bardsley wrote a piece detailing how that was the character of his QPR side back in the day.

In any case, I think focus going into the break is now shifting to events off the pitch. Who knows what will have happened between now and Middlesbrough?",2015-11-09
"I think if Warnock sticks with the 4-2-3-1 we should field a midfield of Doughty and Faurlin in the pivot with Chery-Luongo/Fer-Phillips in front of them and Charlie/JET/Poulter up top.  At the back I think Yun should be prioritized over a 35 year old loanee and a combo of Hill/Hall and Onuoha in the middle with Perch/Henry at RB.  Tozser/Sandro should only be rotation options in the pivot and Hoilett is hot garbage and Mackie when he gets back can be used as an impact sub.

It would be nice to see Gladwin get some minutes, but I think he really got boned by us retaining Phillips/Fer/Charlie.  So for that I think he'll probably get more action out on loan.  ",2015-11-09
"So...we've got this document flying around fueling ownership speculation.

We've got Fernandes dusting off his Twitter password and saying fans should manage their expectations.

Another report says we're duelling with Fulham to sign Hasselbaink.

Crazy Monday.

For what it's worth, the fact that it is an official companies house document and that the figure matches the debt figure so closely gives me some hope. He had mentioned in one of the fan forums a while back that there 'had been discussions about writing off the loans'. If that is what they've done, fair play to them.

"I don't mind the 4-2-3-1 in principle, it's really a case of how it's deployed. Chery is lost on the left because the wingers are clearly under instruction to hug the touchline when we're in possession. Normally that's a tactic where the wingers act as a decoy to spread the defence and create space for runners through the middle. But with Ned and Konchesky as full backs, and a midfield three of Henry, Tozser and Luongo, there's no one running from deep to exploit that space. Better would be if, when in possession, we quickly switch to a 4-3-3 with Philips and Chery and Luongo/Fer flooding the centre. With crisp passing and good movement it should be too much for most Championship defences. That'd be helped by having Yun at left back who can overlap and stretch the opposition defence.",2015-11-05

Tozser, Henry, Faurlin aren't mobile enough for me to linger outside the QPR box helping the defense in one phase, only to quickly bomb it forward to help out at the other end for the next. In fact I prefer Tozser and Ale sitting back in the 4-2-3-1 looking to make that killer pass forward.

Once again, I also am yet to be convinced that we're watching a team that can reliably put in crosses from the wing, which for me makes it all the more important that they try and occasionally ladder the ball up the pitch instead through holding midfielders, attacking midfielders and someone waiting up top to pounce.

I'm also too sure JET is a Zamora type battering ram. He seems to be a bit more of a (Championship) finesse player.",2015-11-05

"Definitely will be sticking with QPR.  I've invested too much time and anguish in these last 5ish years to just move on with it.

Of course, it would have to be someone outside of London, because QPR will always come first.

It's just too hard to not have a game to look forward to watching every weekend.  I've seen 4 of the 11 QPR games this year, all on stuttering, low-quality streams.  I've loved every minute of it, but I also miss getting up early every Saturday morning to pop on a beautiful NBC broadcast (and watch Rangers get crushed). 

So, a combination of both. If QPR swim around in the Championship and League 1 for the next 5-10 years, I'll stay connected and attached, but my enthusiasm may wane without matches to see.

"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who was thinking this - there was a point where Henry spotted some space opening up on the right wing, accelarated into it, received the pass but overhit his cross and it went out for a goal kick. 2nd half + right wing = in front of the R block, and they went mental. Booing, chanting and generally abusing him. It's not like he's in the team for his crossing, and his defensive play up until then had been good. His performance noticably tailed off after that, though his work rate didn't. With every error the crowd grew more unforgiving. 

Henry was one of our least bad performers last season, putting in great efforts against a number of the top sides - especially Liverpool in that game we were unlucky to lose. He's one of those players who seem to do best against better opposition, which makes sense considering he's a limited player with the ball at his feet. He certainly deserves far better than the treatment he was given today, and so, for that matter, does Ramsey.",2015-10-24

"Rightly or wrongly, Henry is seen as CR's man, and as such gets a lot more shit than he should. 

While I get that people may think booing is counter-productive, I can understand the frustration of a lot of the fans, expectations have gone up massively and results haven't matched. Having said that, the manager merry go round will go on sooner or later and who knows what that will bring, I doubt it quietens the fans down for very long. ",2015-10-24

"I agree, to an extent. We shouldn't be playing such bad football with such a deep squad. The rot runs deeper than management, but having heard what CR had to say about Yun really fucked me off. Totally irrational. I think there is a case to be made to keep everything else there, but simply get rid of CR. 

Ideally though, we'd get a more sane/better owner.

"Agree with most of this. What's the point in putting in place this new structure of how we want the club to be run (with Ramsey / Les in command) if we want to get rid of it after 12 games? (and it's hardly like we're winless, rooted to the foot of the table after those 12). Let's say we sacked Les / Ramsey and got another structure to try in? Would we get rid of that after 11 games if they hadn't won most of them too? This is a long term project and its not going to be easy to implement, it might not work but fuck it we need to try sticking with something for a while and hoping it reaps the benefits in the long run. ",2015-10-22
"Absolutely agree. When Fer and Austin decided to stay, everyone suddenly expected us to win 40 games.

We don't want promotion.  We really don't. When we're ready to move back up to the Prem in a couple seasons, Ramsey wont be the man for the job, but he's fine for now.  

Also, we're 11 games into a 46 game season, with a relatively new squad. People need to calm down.",2015-10-22
"This squad is far too good to accept mediocrity. No one can defend Ramsey's starting XI's or substitutions. If we lose while playing our best players at an acceptably high level of effort, I am fine with that. But it is hard to accept that this is the best QPR can offer right now.",2015-10-22
"No wonder the Wednesday fans were pissed. What this doesn't show is that 10 seconds previously, we had possession in a dangerous attacking position.

"> Fer is one of a clutch of big-name players Rangers expected to sell during the summer but ended up keeping, raising the expectations which Ramsey is now being judged by. It’s not the head coach’s fault that the Dutch international decided to piss about with the ball deep in his own half, nor that he later spurned a great chance for an equaliser by shooting wide after turning into an inviting position on the edge of the box. You also can’t blame Ramsey for another of the players we’re jolly excited about still having here, Matt Phillips, wasting one two v two counter attack by dallying on the ball, failing to pass to Chery in space or beat the man in front of him, then later selfishly shooting at home keeper Tomasz Kuszczak from an impossible angle with two team mates awaiting a tap in six yards out in the centre. Some will try all the same – in an increasingly nasty and hostile atmosphere among the support base there seems to be a prevailing feeling that everything that goes right is down to the players and everything that goes wrong is because of Ramsey

I'm just starting to feel bad for Ramsey, and I think this sums up my own view on the whole situation. While he has made some mistakes and continues to do so (i.e. Henry & Green for me), I think expectations have changed, and a lot of our players are massively massively underperforming. Couple that with the club now undermining CR and we are going to be in for a horrible rough patch before the inevitable firing happens and we go full circle and end up nowhere. ",2015-10-19
"I've read a few interviews with Parish. He says he learnt the hard way how to run the club.

In one interview he explained how players used to bang on his door, demanding a rise,  after receiving a 7 out of 10 performance rating in the newspaper.

He said he no longer speaks to players.  ""That's what I pay the manager to do. ""

He also says most footballers are poorly educated and a bit thick. ",2015-10-18
"I think that he still needs time. Especially with news of Warnock coming in to help and the injuries to Austin and Mackie. I would suggest Christmas time. By then either the team will have gelled and people will be back and fit, or we will still be losing and it will be Ramseys fault. 

I'm by no means a huge supporter of Ramsey, but when a couple of players are only just getting back into the team and Austin injured we were always going to have a turbulent time. Given a couple of months the team should stabilise and Warnock will hopefully help Ramsey with selections etc. 

",2015-10-17
"Assuming we're not in serious danger of going down I'd give him the season. We need stability, plus Ramsey's a young manager who's still learning his trade.

"The question is more ""who would replace him?"". There's little point kicking him to the curb if there isn't anyone better available.

For me, the biggest problem I've seen (from the few TV performances I've watched) is that the team appear to be mirroring CR's body language & laid back attitude. He doesn't strike me as the most intense, passionate guy and I think that's translating onto the pitch as a lack of energy, grit & determination.

I think that's further compounded by having what appears to be a weak captain in Onuaha.",2015-10-17
"Personally no longer. The fact he kept henry on and took Jet off when we needed a goal shows he's quite inept imo. Also, he won't drop green, onouha or henry despite being out of form and us having better replacements for them all. Not playing ballon d'or shortlisted luongo who has been one of our best this season, to me, shows he doesn't know what his best team is. 
It's a bit of a cliché but he's a coach, not a manager, his decision making is very poor ",2015-10-17
"In his shoes I'd resign myself to being given the elbow at this point. Thankfully he'll get his money, and in this case I won't begrudge him it. He can't win, the fans will be on his back now and every loss will result in tantrums and meltdowns. It's as if he pulled some Bran Stark shit and took over Onuoha's physical form to concede that penalty today. This addiction to instant results - seemingly not limited to QPR - is insane, and destined to almost always end in tears.

I eagerly await to see what the next man brings to the table. I think people will be in for a rude awakening if they think the squad will perform any better under an alternative, though maybe I'm wrong. It'd be nice see how a team without Henry worked out, I suppose. Neil Warnock's squad won promotion with a very specific recipe, he won't be able to replicate that.

Should've gone for Warburton when we had the chance though, and cashed in on the saleable assets. Tuesday night should be a barrel of laughs.",2015-10-17
"No longer! I hope this warnock appointment is an indication that he's looking to take over again. The LF comments are encouraging, and would appear to suggest we might not give this manager more time than he deserves, which would be a first. Warnock is far from my first choice, but I would take anybody over Ramsey right now.

I think everybody in this sub knows how I feel about the situation. I'll say it again. If we do not get promotion this season we are fucked. And honestly, I can see TF leaving within the next 2 years if that is the case.",2015-10-17
"I will give Ramsey one more game to settle this lineup of should-be All Stars before I'd give him the boot.  He obviously has a knack for goal scoring but that means nothing given the state of our defense.

To say that we should be trying for a play-off spot is an understatement.  We should be looking for the top two spots and nothing less given the unbelievable amount of talent in our lineup.

Unfortunately, by not offloading some of our top players, we've saddled ourselves into a situation where immediate promotion is much more important that it should be.  We stay in the Championship another season and we lose half those players, probably for much less than they are worth.

This is our golden opportunity and if we can't bounce right back into the Premiership I'm afraid we face many years outside the top flight.

Our top priority needs to be sealing the defensive leaks, although at this point you have to ask yourself if anything is holding back the tide at all.  If Ramsey can't do it, get someone else in, the sooner the better.",2015-10-17

"Begs the question, could we make an all-star XI of misdemeaning players? Off the top of my head from recent years, DJ Campbell, Joey Barton, Loic Remy, Danny Simpson and Bradley Orr have all got records. If we're going back a bit we could rope in Vinnie Jones. ",2015-10-13
"Great piece, 100% agree with all of this. Just crossing my fingers he doesn't do himself out of a job first with more poor selection decisions. He has the mandate and we all buy into the vision (of youth development), so let's see it on the pitch and not in the loan market please Chris. ",2015-10-11
"Ramsey is the Messiah, and one of these Saturdays he's gonna re-open Ocean Billy's and feed the 5000 with a single portion of cod and chips wrapped in Friday's Evening Standard.

We'll see. I'm still happy with him. I still don't buy that the squad is 100% some divisional powerhouse yet. It might become one over the course of the season. Rhodes has scored as many goals as Austin; are Blackburn fans crying that they aren't doing better? Now that Fer and Sandro are back, maybe now people will have more justification for moaning if the squad doesn't perform. They are all attacking players though, and we're already the highest scoring team in the division, what more do people want from the top end of the team? It's still early in the season and the squad is only 3 notches from the top, and overall there's still only 11 points between 3rd and 24th.

Overall I think this team should be good enough to survive and stabilise. Flush out Ramsey now and who knows what will happen? I eagerly await to see the results of the crowd turning on him though. Funnily enough that never happened with Redknapp, in spite of the moaning I heard about him.",2015-10-11
"Bolasie rolled Furlong in a rizla and smoked him like a fiend. He needs an extended run in a first team to develop the more devious side of his game to compliment his pace.

He apparently done well on loan at ~~Northampton Town~~ Notts County and played in a cup game for them against Liverpool, as well as scoring in league appearances for them. I suppose on the plus side left-wing is a position where we lack depth, but our Head Coach is currently sitting under a sword of Damocles and the Twitterati would stage a digital insurrection if he rolled the dice on Petrasso.",2015-10-07

You should be able to go to the  QPR website and create an account. After Season ticket holders and other fas with a high number of points have been able to buy, people with basic accounts then get a chance to buy.

Tickets are priced by the quality of the view.

In terms of atmosphere, the best seats are in the Upper Loft, R, S, T & X blocks. X block is closest to the visiting fans, which can be fun. Don't sit right down the front of X block as it has visitors who stare in stunned disbelief when people sing.",2015-10-04

I have a season ticket in A Block (silver) and think that they are decent enough value for the view. Loftus Road isn't a huge ground, the only minor problem would be sitting behind a pillar if you're not careful, there are warnings on ticket page if you have a restricted view. 

I'm not sure about tickets on the day, I think usually you have to get them beforehand (maybe /u/stax_n_stax or /u/doeboy73 know more?). I don't think we've sold out once, so you should be able to get tickets easily enough. If you're really interested you can become a club member (for £30) and get access to pre-sales and a small (£2) discount on home tickets.

">It’s a tough, tough job Chris has got at QPR, I don’t think some people realise that. That squad isn’t as strong as some people make out.

I think he's got a very good point here. Austin and Phillips both play at the extremities, and Fer doesn't appear to be the most versatile player from what I've seen. The rest of the squad wouldn't exactly be walk-ins into a Premier League side.

>Incidentally I remember the team I was part of which got beat 6-0 at Fulham a few years ago and I clashed with Adel Taarabt at half-time when we both got taken off.

In case anyone missed it, [fatboy has already got into trouble at Benfica.](http://www.footmercato.net/liga-sagres/adel-taarabt-fait-deja-des-siennes-a-benfica_162891)",2015-09-29
">they did what they’ve done with every single kick off they’ve had this season – overloaded the right side, laid it back to one of the deep lying midfielders, and then pumped it high into the air. 

Another thing that strikes me is that the team is having no luck in aerial duels.

>Rob Green, who has been in dreadful form throughout 2015 whatever his happy band of fan club members say or believe

He never looks the cheeriest of fellas, but christ his body language has looked off this season. Maybe he really was banking on that West Ham move after all.

>the Australian, as he had done against Blackburn, bottled out at the crucial moment and finished weakly into the side netting.

Has this been a long-standing issue with Luongo? For Australia an dSwindon?

>Twice the Argentinean [sic] got involved in dangerous wrestling games with him. Twice referee Kevin Friend could have awarded penalties.

One risk you can understand, twice is a bit reckless. Added to that dreadful pass intercepted by Pringle, and this was a terrible game for Ale.

>Mackie was withdrawn injured at half time after just ten minutes of action

Canvassing opinions from elsewhere, one good point I saw made was that Mackie's never stop running style might be severely crippled by the fact that he isn't a youngster any more and his body probably won't take to kindly to the same levels of punishment.",2015-09-27
"Another fun write up. And a good point raised about the turnstile manager approach. 

What I find interesting, is that most of the people who used to tweet loads last year have stayed quiet. I have yet to see TF get involved in a Twitter war. So that's a positive I guess... ",2015-09-27
">So I certainly don't think the time has come to replace Ramsey - but at the same time, if we get something like that utter bullshit again in the near future, I can't see him lasting.

I pretty much echo this sentiment.

>Our defending, both as a team and the back four, is now at crisis point.

I think this starts at the base of midfield. I'm not sure what the deal is with Henry right now. Why did he take so long to sign the extension? Why is he not putting in the pretty reliable, clockwork performances we saw for a good chunk of the start of last year? Either way from where I stand he is a weak link, and either Doughty or Sandro should be considered to replace him, who presumably have more talent/more desire respectively. Given Fer's return, who on paper should reprise the no. 10 spot, Luongo might be worthy of consideration to help sit at the back, as he seems tenacious and looks to have a touch of the box-to-box about him. In any case I think time should be called on the Faurlin-Henry partnership.

I still suspect, as I've seen others mention, that Hall should have been given a bit more time. It seems we're doomed to lack a Bartonesque captain, so it would at least be nice to have youthful hunger and urgency.

>Phillips...slowly, seemingly, heading back to his pre-Ramsey days. He did try last night, but nothing came off.

One of many catch-22 situations here. Demote him to not being an automatic first XI player (as if we have superior alternatives) in order to try to motivate him? Doesn't strike me as a bad attitude at all, just a confidence thing. It's so frustrating to watch. it will be interesting to see how he plays with an alternative to Austin...Polter appears to be a hold-up ox, which might be useful for Phillips to pivot around?

>Either the chips are down, everyone rallies behind the coach, he takes a long hard look at his methods and tactics and team selections...Or the same poor form continues (Hull apart) and Ramsey will start to hear his name being chanted

Gonna be a bigger match than it should be on Saturday against Bolton. I expect that a large chunk of P, Q and R will come with their anti-Ramsey chants locked and loaded. Something emphatic is needed. ",2015-09-27
"(Knee jerk comment) 

But Ramsey can go fuck himself, Chery at least gives a shit, unlike most of the players who 'played' tonight. 

EDIT: Also lol

“It was important at that stage to get ourselves to half-time with the score as catchable as possible.”",2015-09-25
"That was so strange. He seemed to get roundly booed as he was subbed off from some angrier fans, and when he came around and started applauding as he walked by the stand I was thinking maybe he was trying to make sure he didn't lose us? Then everyone started applauding him and singing his name, and then he disappeared down the tunnel.

Then when I retook my seat after the half, I see than his replacement Mackie had been pulled anyway due to injury. X-files.",2015-09-25

"> *His is a remarkable knack for getting on the end of chances and when we meet he talks about trying to break his personal record from the 2012-13 season when he notched his 20th Championship goal for Burnley on his 17th game on 6 November.*

Sounds good to me.",2015-09-03
"QPR seems to keep benefiting from this strange cycle of fortune and misfortune. Get promoted, suffer from an almost completely frozen transfer window as the club is being sold. Get bought by immensely wealthy owners who'll throw around insane amounts, but get lumbered with mercenaries and maniacs. Get relegated, but bounce straight back up. Get relegated again, but still retain an 18 goal Premier League striker on the books.

I doubt there are many players in his situation who wouldn't have pushed for a move and an inevitable pay rise, even considering an inevitable lucrative signing-on fee elsewhere when his contract is up. Pretty staggering good fortune to have ended up with one.

In light of how the window played out, he should be ravenous for goals. It also must be an instant boost to the morale of all the other members of the squad that he's still here. That bit of star quality will inevitably throw some light onto the rest of the guys. The opportunities to rack up some highlight reel assists should be more plentiful. Every clever ball played up from the back will be that little bit more interesting with the prospect of a poacher of Austin's quality up the top.

I suppose the only possible negative is the question mark over his suitability as a lone striker. However given the apparent focus on moving the ball up the pitch on the ground, and the pace that's available behind him, hopefully he'll be fine. There's also the prospect of occasional Zamora-style partnerships with Polter too.",2015-09-03
"I'd do it in a heartbeat. Should also mean Matty will stay. And when we get other contracts off the books it won't look so bad. I see this as a win win for both parties really. However, I wonder if it is true, GWL aren't the most reliable when it comes to our stories. ",2015-09-03
"Well you would, wouldn't you, if you were his agent? He's on half as much as the club's top earners. 

The smart move would be to offer him a lower basic wage with hefty goal, appearance and promotion bonuses. It's fairly likely that with the amount we'll play him (and the lack of adequate cover up front) he'll get injured, as he did last time we were in the championship.",2015-09-03
Would it be profitable to meet his demands with a 15m buy-out? Sounds better than letting him go for free in 12 months.,2015-09-03
"Isn't he on less then 30k a week, and was offered a 60k a week contract in January.",2015-09-03
Honestly can't see any reason why they wouldn't. We have paid more for substantially worse players. That's still reasonable wages for someone of his quality plus then we either get to keep him when we go up or at least make something off him when he goes. Seems like a win win to me.,2015-09-03
Only way you do this is if promotion is well in sights. Middle of the table come January and you sell. You can't let an asset like Austin go for nothing. ,2015-09-03

"But for JET'S miss against Cardiff, I think he might have got it. I think it's gonna be Hughton's month though, and hopefully Ramsey will take it next time.",2015-09-03
"From the sounds of things we are not carrying any lunatics, trouble makers or media egos. I suppose one of the biggest cautionary flags to be waved is that QPR is probably still very much a stepping stone club for a lot of these guys. Obviously Austin and Phillips, but also Chery and Luongo. As part of instilling some solidity I'd hope they can set in motion a pattern and plan that can survive the comings and goings of the football world. When one piece drops out, we should have replacements ready and the financial situation to accommodate them.

In common with most home crowds these days, Loftus Road can be pretty quiet, but it just takes a few on-pitch sparks to breathe some life into them. A goal, an injustice, some mayhem. I think (hope) the ingredients are there for a lot of these moments to be served up over the coming months, and I can't really ask for more than that, and my measure of success is walking away from most matches feeling ever so slightly electrified. I'm in no rush to bounce back to the Premier League, but I must admit the prospect of another bout of playoff excitement in May would be fun.",2015-09-02
"I have to disagree. While what you've said sounds lovely in theory, we need to wake up and smell the coffee. We can't afford to dither in the championship and try and engender good team spirit and strengthen the foundation because if we are still in the championship next season all our best players will leave. There is no way we will be able to get through another summer and still hang onto Austin,  Phillips etc. Austin in particular is pivotal to any chances we have of promotion, and we must also put our efforts into getting back up in time to profit from the new EPL TV deal. 

Now, more than ever, we need to get back up. If we don't I think we consign ourselves to another 4 or 5 years in the lower leagues with all the players who will potentially leave in the summer. 

And let's not kid ourselves; if we do get back up it won't come down to whether Onuoha has stepped up or whether our midfielders are working well together, it's going to come down to whether we can keep Austin fit and firing all season long. It cannot be understated how important he will be, and losing him is largely why I think we'd be stuck in the championship for a few seasons. 

Also, credit where it's due: Harry played a big part in this solid core of players we have now. If we get up, it'll be through Harry's players, Luongo and Chery.",2015-09-02

"It would be useful if they actually established longer term relationships with clubs (preferably local) to farm players out to more regularly. Sutherland, Petrasso, RGC/Blackwood, Kpekawa, Manning, Comley and Furlong should all be sent elsewhere to have a better shot at first team football.",2015-09-02
My main expectation now is for the Ramsey out brigade to look foolish.,2015-09-01
I certainly think we can challenge for promotion whether playoffs or automatically with the team we've got. It won't be easy as our defence is still a bit shaky and will take some time to gel with recent additions but offensively we are looking like a team with a solid opportunity. ,2015-09-01
"There's still pressure on our wage bill, which could see some players go out on loan. Other than that, we have a team that could be looking at promotion this year. But let's not forget, it's still the beginning of the season.",2015-09-01
"It's insane how we've managed to keep all these players. Who've we even sold? Austin, Sandro, Fer and Phillips are all still here, and we were unlucky to lose Caulker as well. My expectations for the season have rocketed. We have got to be aiming for the playoffs if Austin stays fit. ",2015-09-01

We're probably slightly hemmed in by the three year losses FFP rules.

"Yeah I commented on the same thing back in the match thread. On the first goal was particularly notable - although it was actually Perch who celebrated with Austin having watched it back on the player. Personally I thought Austin's body language was strange throughout a lot of the match - not bad or negative, but a man who means business. As much as we can write off Sullivan's comments, there might be some truth there among what the potential buyers are feeling towards that £15m price tag. That has to be really infuriating for the guy.

Chery actually seems to have a pretty poor command of English (for a Dutch person), having watched his latest interview. Maybe he is still settling in, having arrived pretty late on in the summer? He seemed to enjoy the second one more. I was pleased the the crowd gave him a decent applause when he was subbed off and he seemed to appreciate it. When Fer is back to fitness that should be another positive relationship on the pitch.

Still very early days for a lot of these squad relationships, so hopefully things will improve. Was good to see Faurlin run in to rectify the situation though. We still have a celebration with Mackie on the pitch to look forward to!",2015-08-24

"

Couple of random things from mobile. Think I'd think about starting Doughty over Henry. Seems a touch more versatile. However Henry is still a senior figure so I think he'll be automatic for a few games yet. Maybe better option when holding onto a lead at the end. When Sandro comes back though - if his Internacional training has kept him match fit - methinks he takes that spot. Ephraim was waxing lyrical about Faurlin yesterday. I'd start him against Carlisle and see if he's still safe for a longer stretch. Really like Polter - battering ram. Onuoha scampering off onto the attack and weighting the ball to Phillips was a highlight. Overall pleased with him but I can see a few mistakes in him over the stretch. Gladwin looks more promising than Hoilett but early days. Luongo is a battler - really good to have him as well. Chery gets the ball down to his feat beautifully. On the whole I was pretty entertained, with that final scene with JETS miss and the equaliser playing out particularly humorously in my area.

One thing I noticed was that the lower school end was pretty empty, as were swathes of X block. Maybe the new regime isn't practicing the same seat-stuffing tactics. The attendance was just below 15k. ",2015-08-16

"I feel this is a good attempt at discussing Ramsey in some depth, however, I think the author doesn't really say much that hasn't been mentioned a lot over the course of the last couple of months. 

As much as Ramsey is the focus of the article, I feel like the constraints that we're working under are more important to our current situation than simply the manager and a change of 'culture'. Les Ferdinand in his role as DoF has been key to arranging transfers, which has limited what Ramsey can and cannot do, who he can sign etc. It's a nice change of pace from bringing in Redknapp and Hughes style signings (i.e. throw money at players and hope they get the job done), but you can tell that we're inexperienced in this style of working as Fer, Austin and Phillips are still on our books, the latter two with only a year left on their deals, so we're at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with other clubs. To top it all off, we're also in a poor situation vis a vis GKs. I like Green, he's been a model pro, but he's not a long term option and losing McCarthy was a kick in the teeth. 

I'm also assuming Hoos, new CEO, has some input over the transfers and running of the club, and was brought in to help shore up our finances. I have no idea what he's been doing behind the scenes, but that is an additional contraint that I assume Ramsey has to work under. Maybe he had to do something with us bringing in a GK coach last week. The same here could also be said about our new co-chairman, the money man, and TF's moving back from the hands on running of the club, though maybe he works more long term, again I can't really say.

Finally, we have the hangover of last season and another shitty preseaon. I think the lapses at Charlton are exactly the same kinds of issues that dogged us last season, fatigue, lack of concentration and (again) a shitty preseason. Quite a few local journos and even the author of the piece write about consolidation, but what does that mean? Beyond that, surely, the club should have arranged a better preseason? I think it means that we're about a month behind in terms of preparations, than where we should be, and it shows. Clive mentioned  in the GBBO podcast from last week that he doesn't see us getting many (or any) points from our first three games, and that is in danger of coming true. So how long until our fans turn on him? 

Anyway, this is just a conglomeration of thoughts put together from other sources etc, and I just wanted to put them down somewhere.

Not good signs, we are definitely taking a chance on a former international who seems past his usefulness at least in the PL.  Maybe he has another season of Championship football in him but this signing seems much like the Dunne signing two years ago.",2015-08-04
"Not the greatest signing,, but will give some needed experience given the influx of younger players. Also provides us with a bit of depth, and i would expect him to start against Charlton unless CR gives Kpekawa a go.",2015-08-04
"As a stopgap measure, this signing could be completely pointless, or it could be season-saving. It's one base covered, but I don't think it was the most important base to cover. ",2015-08-04

Southend fan here. Your bid is derisory. We rejected an offer from Hull for £1m last week. Does your board really believe that we'd accept less? I think it would cost at least £2m to make our chairman sniff.,2015-08-04

"Maybe Tony thinks that, if (read: when) Charlie goes, RGC or Manning will be able to become viable options to compliment Polter up front? I mean, I hope not, as it'd be nice to replace Chaz with another proven goal scorer, but you have to imagine they have a plan to replace him for when it happens. ",2015-08-03

"I agree it's later than is ideal to make additions, but if they really want a forward it shouldn't be too hard to loan one in - there are plenty of very early 20s kids who can run about but won't get a game at their own club. Shit, even Mitroglou and Goochanejhad are still seemingly in limbo. If they've got Austin cash to burn they could handle those pay packets. Defenders on the other hand are a trickier prospect - if I was going to pointlessly lambast the co-chairman on a lack of movement in the window, it would be on finding someone to parner up with Onuoha.",2015-08-03

Sounds fair.,2015-08-02
"The defense is a worry but we all know that already. However I took the plunge and took out the Player subscription today and watched, and I saw a lot of other positives:

Diakité - the box-to-box man we've lacked for so long? You get that dude running away at pace with the big man up top and the likes of Chery, Phillips or even Hoilett speeding alongside him as options - magic could happen.

Blackwood - looks like you've got a professional workhorse there, with a sprinkling of talent. If he cranks out those kinds of performances in training, I'd imagine Ramsey will give him time from the bench or even a cup runout.

Chery - the gift that Paladini/Sterling bestowed upon us, there's some beautiful technique and deadball competence as mentioned above.

Gladwin - first time I've seen him, looked good, and he seemed to be pretty in tune with the rest of the squad. Maybe slightly overshadowed by coming in with the Asian Cup player of the tournament but looked just as handy as Luongo.

JET - We looked more dangerous with him on the pitch.

Moving the ball up the field - certainly more entertaining than Zamora-ball.

I think we'll be OK losing Fer, and that our midfield will be one of the strongest in the league. I also think all the people screaming for Ramsey's head over his tactics and selections at the end of last season can safely reassess their opinions.",2015-08-02
"Chery looks like he has quite a free-kick on him after striking the post before the first half whistle. 

By the way, Polter has been receiving a tonne of stick within his last couple performances. From what i hear, it seems that he gets himself in the right position but lacks composure.",2015-08-02
"Probably worth pointing out that Austin and Fer won't take part in the friendly, and neither will the trialist form the previous friendly, defender Christopher Schorch.",2015-08-02

"He is a real asset to the team as well as the game and I think he's a great example for players in the same situation. I think it's amazing how he remembers where he came from and hasn't let his success go to his head and become too big for his boots- see: clyne and sterling, although they weren't non league they still rose in the game very quickly. 
I was having a discussion with some friends a few days ago and it was about if rickie lambert had stayed at Southampton he'd be one of the best strikers in the league last season, and I'm glad Austin isn't making that same mistake of being number 2 at a top club.  
Also,  I find it incredibly admirable that he doesn't mind sacrificing his international career for us, however I believe that if we stayed up instead of Leicester he would have got the cap instead of vardy. 
The fact that he will stay until told otherwise suggests to me that we can scrap that asking price and reject all bids for him. The only thing I fear is that we lose him next season when his contract is up,  so les better start acting fast. 
I know the term ""legend"" has been used very loosely lately, but the fact that he sticks with us despite clearly deserving more,  shows signs of this,  I'm willing to say now that he is at least an club icon.

We need to build a team for the future, £15 million would be huge towards that rather than the likely promotion that Austin's goals would get us again which would mean we'd have to build a Premier League squad at short notice, unless he chose to stick with us if we got promoted immediately back.",2015-07-11

In the last four seasons the headcount has exploded from 104 to 169, including a 43 increase in the number of players, managers and coaches from 69 to 112.*

> *Despite relegation the wage bill was only trimmed by £2.6 million (3%) from £78 million to £75.4 million, increasing the wages to turnover ratio from 129% to an almost unimaginable 195%. In other words, QPR spent twice as much on wages as their income – and then had to fund all their other expenditure.*

That is beyond reckless, it's utter chaos.



> *Incredibly, the figure would have been even higher at £250 million if the shareholders had not written-off £60 million and converted £5 million into equity (the maximum permitted by FFP rules) in 2014. Just pause for a moment and consider that: a quarter of a billion debt.*

We could probably scrape another 15 from selling sandro fer and caulker ,  which is effectively half our fine.  as for transfers,  les ferdinand says he has a list of lower league players which he is after, so hopefully some good can come from there. 
Ramsey certainly wasn't my first choice as manager,  I'd have much preferred mark Warburton,  but he's here now and we'll have to make do with it. When he first took over the players looked really motivated and wanted to play. The only things I worry about are his tactics and whether the players respect him a lot - see caulker,  vargas etc. What I think we need is to get rid of bond and get a tactical,  fearsome assistant,  eg roy Keane,  possibly hill if he retires.

Unless, OOC speeds up, in which case I can see TF sit back for a while, as that will generate a fair few quid. In this scenario we may have more time to 'build' the right way.

I can picture decent effort on the pitch from honest pros signed with good intentions, regularly losing matches on individual moments of communications breakdown, or pure cohesion of opposition play.

If QPR's professional reputation in the industry is going to be rebuilt then they will have to sail away from the scum who lumbered us with so many players that made us appreciate the likes of Hill, Faurlin and Mackie even more. They need to recruit from different talent pools entirely, and there is of course a question mark over how much experience they have in this area.

I can't find any indication of what kind of tactical record Ramsey has outside of QPR. His Charleston battery squad won a championship in 2003, but there doesn't seem to be a lot documented.

Pessimistically, more Spurs finger prints all over the squad for the fourth year running.

For any of you guys from abroad somehow tempted to make the trip to see QPR next season, I recommend targeting the Brentford match.",2015-05-25
"For me,  both of them seemed to have immense work rates and I thought they were good signings. They were better at the start of the season,  but it's possible that Ramsey didn't like them because he said a while back that he will only pick those who train hard, so it's likely they were quite lazy in training. As for vargas refusing to come on - I could probably see why; losing 3-1 to palace when he could be back playing in the europa league,  but it was unacceptable and I'm glad that Ramsey gave him the boot. ",2015-05-25
"The Vargas thing is true as the club confirmed the two weeks wages fine. On the surface it looks like the string of stories that week were a co-ordinated, self-defensive leak to a journalist close to Ramsey. ""We're going down, but look at the shit I'm working with"" kinda thing.",2015-05-25
i dont blame Vargas at all! getting benched for the likes of someone like SWP then being asked to come on for him when we were 3-0 down. as for isla he follows his buddy.,2015-05-25
"Perhaps one of Fernandes' biggest failures this season was not having the balls to knife Redknapp in the back early enough. Trouble is it was such a house of cards with Redknapp's players in the squad that it might have been too risky a move. I wonder how much of a feel Fernandes had for what the mood was around the place - how well informed can he have been when he was so far away so often?

I pity him to some extent though. It reached the point a while ago where the chaos was all knotted together to the point that any decision could have had a negative outcome somewhere else. New era now though, new CEO, Ferdinand era and Ramsey from scratch. Maybe this time?",2015-05-25

Another typical Fernandes move. When we're not getting bailed by world class goals out of nothing next season as we were this year he will realise what a mistake this was.

"Excellent summary.

Assuming any potential fine will not be counted against the club in its presentation of yearly accounts for FFP compliance checking, based on last years accounts ([page 15, £38mn revenue with parachute](http://www.scribd.com/doc/258474746/QPR-Holdings-limited-2014)) we should be looking at a combined transfer and wage spend of around £40-50 million, while the parachute payments are in place. That's actually not that bad considering the parachute payments are largely in place to cover expenses clubs are lumbered with following relegation - we're in this weird situation where a lot of the high earners are on their way out. The only headaches I can imagine are Onuoha, Hoilett, Caulker, Taarabt, Traoré and Sandro. Depressingly, given the timing of their signings, their pedigree (deserved or not) and their previous clubs, I can envisage this lot collectively costing upwards of 200k a week. That's a quarter of the hypothetical budget up in smoke right there.

I don't think we can be hit with an embargo on top of a fine, thankfully. If even such a thing were to happen, they'd have to bend the rules to allow us to actually build a team.

>Acquiring players for salaries >£15k per week.

First things first - they need to act quick to settle their new manager/head coach into the position. That man then needs to sit down with Ferdinand, and come up with a plan A and a plan B and then hit the market and buy accordingly. I wouldn't be going for a premium striker purchase like Fulham made with McCormack, I'd be looking to bring in a second striker from a Championship club and pitch him a deal as the number one choice up top. I'd probably set aside a larger chunk of the transfer kitty for this. I'd look to buy/sign the rest in from anywhere from League One to the Scottish Championship.

The next larger transfer fee I'd set aside is for a captain. Probably a central defender or holding midfielder. None of the retained players will be up to the job - we've seen that they just aren't talkers. Someone needs to be barking out orders to the defense or midfield.

For the rest I'm imagining a lot of cheap-ish unattached players signing.

>Competing in the Championship against clubs that are executing well-developed long-term plans.

This is why I don't think we'll be competing for any honours next year. This year's Championship was intense stuff, with the top 8 teams playing for something down to the wire. On top of that, Burnley are going down with loads of money. Even Wolves are still due a final parachute payment. Then you're bumping up against the simple fact that most of the teams are bigger than us.

I'm actually more excited by the QPR narrative than I have been in a while now.",2015-05-11
"I think you're spot on, though the fine may be a tad larger. 

If we do face a transfer embargo, can we still sign players on a free? 

I do think in the utter worst case scenario, we end up like Blackpool, cobbling a team together last minute and getting spanked out the league - but with boat loads more debt.

Plus side, I think some youth players will be given a chance, i.e. Petrasso, Manning, Grego-Cox, Donaldson, Furlong and Mulraney, so we get to see if they'll pan out! 

But I do think we'll be lucky to be mid table next season. ",2015-05-11
"Though it's mostly bad news, somehow reading this makes me feel happier about the future of the club. Most of what we'll lose over the coming months needs to be lost. Many of those high-salary players who are staying either have resale value or could be good performers in the Championship. I don't reckon we'll get £30mill from player sales this summer though. 

Personally I'd like to see Ramsey stay at the club, but if a top manager is available we should attempt to sign him. I would include Warnock in that bracket. As has been pointed out here, it will now get much harder to attract players with our damaged reputation and low salary offers; having a proven manager would help immeasurably. We will soon need to replace a lot of players, and the kind of signings we need are in the Warnock mould (Clint Hill for next to nothing, Jamie Mackie for £500k, etc). Come to think of it, Mackie isn't up to much these days - sign him up!",2015-05-11

A) American (yikes) and
B) Only been following the Premier League for two years,

They finished last season in the Championship disappointingly, as with the quality of team they had comparative to the rest of the league there's no reason in my opinion that they should have not been crowned champs. But they weren't. They didn't even gain auto promotion, and frankly, if Zamora doesn't net that 90' header to seal the deal, I think Derby would've won in extra time. But anyway, Harry Redknapp tried to employ a Tottenham style of football at QPR, and while it clearly benefited Charlie Austin, his back four was left hanging, due to so many men committed forward. And as a result the goals came in a flurry, and so did the losses.
Going forward, where is the state of QPR? Well, if the board stays with Ramsey and forks over the fair-play fine, in great shape. Due to being way out of market I only saw the R's twice all year, against the Champions at Loftus Road and MC at the Etihad, both defeats. But the difference in those games is when they came in the year. For 86 or so minutes, QPR had Mo and Chelsea nervous. They were flying up the pitch, making Courtois work for every euro he makes, and it was only because of the Fabregas goal that all their momentum was killed. But that QPR team wasn't the one that played yesterday against City. No, the team that hit the pitch yesterday almost appeared like they wanted to get relegated. There was no energy going forward, the back four was a revolving door, constantly spinning around to chase Aguero as he torched them.
Again, I'm not trying to bash Rangers, I'm just a tad disappointed. This was a Rangers team I thought was going to finish at best mid-table, realistically about 14 or 15. Instead with 2 games to go they'll probably finish at the foot. Ramsey will produce young talent going forward, he did wonders for Tottenham's youth academy, (my example I'm thinking of is Harry Kane) and I believe they'll be top flight soon. In the meantime, if you want to loan and/or transfer Charlie Austin, as a fan of Crystal Palace we'll gladly take him.",2015-05-11

If Redknapp was backed in January I believe we would have stayed up. The way the owners kept tight fisted with their funds can only suggest the possibility of going down did not frighten them. It was risky. If we are going to get this fine then why not let Harry give it his all to keep us up?

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.

Best case scenario, and mathematically very unlikely, we stay up, keep players, put in some solid training in the break, end up with a proper playing strategy and a team that gels together, keeps the ball, defends well, attacks efficiently, and is generally as good as we can be.

Few expect us to get points from City or Liverpool, so lets look at our relegation rivals fixtures;

Sunderland - Southampton and Everton, think they'll lose both.

Leicester - Chelsea and Newcastle, with a game in hand I see them beating Newcastle but not Chelsea.

Hull - Liverpool and Arsenal, home fixtures but I think they should lose both, they've also got a few in shorter time frame.

Burnley - Hull and West Ham, I see them winning both.

Palladini was the person who bought Ale Faurlin on a dodgey deal that almost got us deducted points in our promotion year under Warnock.

The big warning around him is financial deals, buying players. Things went on that were likely not above board.

"Sheer capacity limitation means that there were less than 2000 Chelsea fans in attendance yesterday, so I'd wager that a lot of what you've read is from very superficial ideas of what QPR fans were like yesterday. They probably omitted to mention the nice rally of to-and-fro chanting in the first half, which began with ""Terry, you're a cunt"", progressed to ""John Terry, he's won more than you"", which was then met with a double strike of ""You're mum is a thief"" and ""John, Terry, We know what you are"" (i.e. a racist) from QPR, which elicited a final, classy response of ""We know what you are, Anton Ferdinand, we know what you are"" (i.e. what Terry called him at the time) from them. Throwing stuff at the players isn't cool, but the verbals dished out to the team and their fans were all fair game in my opinion, and any Chelsea fan who thinks their travelling supporters were any better is very mistaken.

As for becoming a big club, a little bit bigger wouldn't hurt. Fulham showed that there is scope to grow quite nicely over the course of a decade or so. I still think QPR is well placed to serve a respectable slice of West London's population. I saw a Labour Party activist report back from a local meeting at Ealing Council (an administrative division of London) that two alternative sites for a new stadium have been proposed in Park Royal and Greenford. This would probably allow for more modest, realistic growth nested within suburban areas of the city from which to attract fresh supporters. I doubt at this stage that QPR will ever reach the aspirations of Fernandes and co., which is probably a good thing. I think the club should primarily be a communal expression of West London, with the added benefit of being just big enough to have loyal support from all over the place on the side. They probably need to do something to recreate the magic that attracted so many Scandinavian supporters in the '80s, for example. Chelsea, Arsenal, Man U, even Liverpool...to be honest you could have these teams play an entire season's home games abroad and [they'd probably sell out comfortably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4l4kOhdWFc).

Stadium size also matters. Around two years ago I went to see Dortmund in their cavernous 80k ground. My overriding feeling was that it's too big. They can create a massive tifo that looks impressive, but I'm not sure it compares to a sold out allocation at Millwall pumping out ""no-one likes you, cause you're shit"". I'll also confess I came away from the home playoff leg against Wigan feeling more exhilarated than Wembley. Wembley served up an incredible wall of sound after the Zamora goal, but it didn't match the intimacy and accoustics of Loftus Road. If they do manage to build something new, I hope they maintain the shoebox style.",2015-04-13
"I think that ""big"" is too much of a generalization.

I want to see us grow but in a way more similar to Swansea or Southampton.  In fact I think we should aspire to the likes of Southampton, who have improved as a club in a drastic and inspiring sense.  I do not want us to grow off the back of a billionaire owner who purchases talent instead of cultivating it.

In the past 3-4 years we have operated similarly to a misfiring engine.  I feel as though Fernandes has truly appreciated the nature of his mistakes and is now building a proper framework for a fiscally responsible, well-performing football club.

As far as getting in the right people, which is the first step as Fernandes has previously stated, we are on the right track.  It was not long ago that we were presented with a writeup on the absolute farce that our training staff had devolved into after the appointment of our new owners (prior to Fernandes).  Next up is a proper training facility, one that empowers youth talent to step up and succeed.  If you refer to a recent interview with three of our prospective youth talents, they each possess a fantastic work ethic and understand the value of, ""work hard and you will be rewarded.""

The togetherness of the squad, compared to two years ago at this time, is not even comparable.  These players are fighting for their lives in the Premier League, whereas the squad of two years ago were simply collecting wages.  As much as Redknapp contributed to our fiscally precarious situation he also united the team as a brilliant man manager.  Ramsey, thankfully, has inherited a spirited squad and barring a few questionable team decisions has had a massively positive impact on our form and consistency.  The overall fitness of the team has improved under Ramsey and that is a direct result of his modern training methods.

I see improvement on the pitch, in the back office, and at the youth levels.  Through improvement will come growth but it will be the type of growth that we should embrace.   If this growth one day results in QPR being a big club, then I will embrace it as such.",2015-04-13
"I remember back in 2007 we barely half filled Ellerslie road each game.  It was possible to buy a ticket on the day of a game, wait for the match to begin and sit where you liked. That's how I decided I liked X block.

So we're already a lot bigger than we were a few years ago. 

I never want QPR to be a proper big club. We should stick to being who we are and look forward to the occasional fleeting moments of glory.",2015-04-13

"We're a small club with a tiny old-school ground, Mourinhio loves British football culture. QPR offer no threat to Chelsea's on-going champions status. 


I've never had an issue with Mourinho. Anyone that's able to deal with the spoiled prima donnas at the top-level is worthy of some respect.

**Most importantly:** Mourinho being nice to us is a good way of diffusing any rivalry, which is the only thing that has given us an advantage over them in the past.",2015-04-13
"Basically confirmed, Mourinho to take over at the end of the season. ",2015-04-13
"He does. It was obvious that he has a soft spot for us when we played them earlier in the season. He likes our fans and the atmosphere we bring. No wonder given the lack of atmosphere at their home games.

"Keep the faith, anything can happen and we are in great form, it isn't over until we are actually down",2015-04-12
"Aside from the idiots lobbing lighters and programmes at the celebrating Chelsea players, I thought the supporters were superb today and lived up to what was expected of them. It kinda makes me wonder why they can't recreate that on a more regular basis. I think pumping in with that level of noise and passion against some of the other teams we played at Loftus Road, we might have swayed things a bit for a point or two more.

Rob Green has pulled off some amazing shot stops over the course of the season, but as I mentioned on the other thread his distribution is just so sketchy. I thought the midfield were ok today in challenging in the air, but there have been other times when I wished Green could put it out with a little bit more finesse. Not sure if there is any truth in [the stat that I've just seen, but here it is...](https://twitter.com/Squawka/status/587380484675518465)

Edit: But I don't want to be overly harsh on Green. In the catalogue of mistakes this season, there have been costlier ones: Austin's missed penalty against Hull, Vargas' conceding the penalty at Stamford Bridge, Traoré and Yun switching off when Sterling took his free kick against Liverpool, Barton red card at Hull...

I'm a tad concerned over what McCarthy will do in the summer. Another year sat on his arse might not be what he was expecting here. 

I don't think we were helped in our very limited options from the bench. When you have to have three kids who haven't even been out on loan dressed and ready, you know you've got problems.

Warming to Ramsey again after the last few performances after the bizarre decision to roll SWP out for a game. We have a nice storyline coming up with him I guess, because I'm pretty sure there's a job waiting for him at Villa if he wants it.

I'm still pessimistic about our chances though. It's just a bit gutting that we'll finish so low when we've really only posted a handful of truly dreadful performances throughout the season. ",2015-04-12
"I'll say they deserved a draw, not a win.  But that says something about the team and the Manager.  They might have won if one of those attempts on target had been to a spot where the keeper wasn't, but Courtois had a ""pretty good game"".

I'll admit that I was quick to blame Rob Green for a poor kick, but the reality is that he did get the ball up and away from the box, not straight to an opposing player who tapped it in.  Not his best moment, but he goal could have been prevented.  I think we have to admit it was a great setup and finish for the goal.  

If only our strikers could have converted a few opportunities...
",2015-04-12
"Unfortunately at this stage we probably need points against Liverpool and City, which I can't see us getting, unlike the other teams around us that are capable of earning points from unlikely sources. We're gone now I think. ",2015-04-12
"No new news since the accounts for the 13/14 season in the Championship were released, showing some shifty financial reporting that tried to disguise the fact that the club lost around £70 million. I don't think this particular episode will play out until the summer. I think with the parachute payment and the Austin sale we'll hopefully cover most of any fine, if they choose not to fight it. If they do decide to go to battle over it, watch this space for hilarity/tragedy, depending on how you feel about us.",2015-04-12
"The key to this game will be the atmosphere, especially getting Remy off his game, which I think we can accomplish.

As far as our lineup goes if Yun is not available Clint Hill will likely feature at left back.  Hill puts in a shift and covers well at LB but against top opposition like Chelsea I'm afraid he could struggle.  We really need to get Yun back.  The next question is whether Dunne makes an immediate return to the starting XI.  I don't think Caulker has done enough wrong to lose his starting spot and I also believe that Chelsea would find a way to exploit two 34+ defenders.  On the right side Isla is an obvious lock.  Isla is competent at right back but against top opposition, as we saw with Lukaku, he will get exploited.  Everytime I talk about the right back position all I can think about is why did we sell Danny Simpson...

In the midfield, Sandro, Barton and Phillips are obvious.  Our only concern is left midfielder.  I say we start Traoré.  He has proven defensive qualities as well as pace and proved a nuisance against Villa.  Both Kranjcar and Hoilett have started the position but neither have made it their own.  It is quite late in the season to be giving out opportunities at any position but if Traoré can go on a run of good form and transform our left wing the same way Phillips has the right, then by all means give him the opportunity.

Interestingly, I feel like Ramsey has been purposely vague about which players are fit and which are not, in an attempt to throw off Mourinho and his strategy going into the game.

"Good news but the Chelsea game is not the right occasion to reintroduce a rusty and unfit player. We need to hit Chelsea with, as Clint says, 'a cauldron of fire and hate'. That's not really Fer's style. ",2015-04-08
"I'd say the 4 points in two games is massive for us. Burnley play Arsenal next and the others also have difficult fixtures which means we shouldn't be too threatened - A win against Chelsea will take us into like 15th, and I'm sure we can win against West Ham (Especially with Fer and Dunne back). Newcastle and Leicester are definitely winnable fixtures. Both Liverpool and Man City have been in weak form, and hopefully our new away form will continue there. We can take 9 points from our remaining games at least.",2015-04-07
"Leicester are as good as gone. Their game in hand is against Chelsea and can't see them climbing off bottom. 

Burnley have some tough fixtures coming up and hull have a very formidable run-in. 

You could argue that we have the pick of the more winnable games. Let's just hope the results reflect it.  

Unfortunately still not holding my breath for safety at this point though. ",2015-04-07
"I'd try that 3-5-2 from the get go against Chelsea, with instructions to play conservatively. I'd test the waters first to see what kind of Chelsea we're up against, and if they are looking a bit too threatening hang back and play for the point, whilst hoping that we come out at the other end only 3 points away from Villa or Hull.

West Ham, on the other hand, is, once again, a real must win. Lamentably I'll be away, missing my first QPR competitive home fixture since August 2013. It might be a small mercy though...if we lose that on top of the Chelsea match, that could be the end.

I'm still not confident on the whole. There are so many things that can go wrong even against the 'weaker' teams lined up, in terms of mistakes from players with extensive records of screw-ups, getting burned for pace at the back, not providing enough opportunities for Austin, Zamora having an anonymous day, etc. etc. However last night's Phillips to Austin goal was definitely a spark of optimism...if they can close out the season with a productive partnership, who knows what could happen?",2015-04-07

Keep it tight, keep a clean sheet, and if we still haven't scored after an hour we've got options to come off the bench and throw everything at them.

"Traore on the left of midfield. He and Matt Philips pump crosses for Charlie and Bobby all evening, allowing Joey and Sandro to sit a little deeper in midfield and be solid through the middle. It also sets a solid platform allowing us to bring on Hoilett if we need to change the game in the 2nd half.

Plus if Villa try to use Weimann and Agbonlahor's pace against Clint on our left, we'll need Traore there to counter it.",2015-04-06
"Usually he's quite poor and makes a number of mistakes, but against West Brom he was our strongest defender (Made as many clearances as the rest of the back four put together). One of our main defensive weaknesses is the failure to win headers in the box, Onouha tends to just watch the ball until it's too late, but I think this is something Caulker's strong at. If he performs as he did against West Brom, then he'll deserve praise but defending will be difficult especially with Clint Hill around. My optimism for the Villa game is damaged, but I'm still hopefull and if the players share my enthusiam we should at least put up a fight. Considering the outstanding goals our side our capable of scoring, I'd love to see a large number of shots from our side.

"I think he is the one of the first names on the team sheet behind Austin and Greeno (obviously) and that must mean something. He makes a fair few mistakes, but i am certain that if it weren't for him, we would be conceding a tonne more goals.

He has a lot to learn, but it is comforting when i see his name on the starting squad.",2015-04-06

It legitimised some decisions which would later turn out to be naive. Sure, I'm all for youth, but Furlong was a huge mistake in the Palace game. I think he believed in doing what Harry did not - take SWP for example. Why *start* him against Palace when he can't even make the bench for Everton? I'm not SWP advocate at all - far, far from it - but to me bringing him in from the cold one week then dropping him entirely shows he doesn't know what he's doing.

Sunday was our moment, given the other results that weekend. And we fluffed it; our line-up and tactics were taken to pieces.

The fact is we were a better team with some players out of their usual position. Vargas over SWP definitely.

What I'd like to do now is try to enjoy the time we have left but that's hard enough. 

I've always been a big fan of Tony Fernandes, but it's starting to dawn on me that he is the problem with QPR. I love the guy, I really do, but his naivety and financial mishaps have been damaging. He either backs his manager blindly or gives into rash decisions. IMHO, the only way we're going to move forward, as much as it pains me to say, is when he leaves, which I have a strange feeling will be sooner rather than later.

The only way we could have stayed up was if Tony backed Harry in the transfer window. You might argue that Harry's signed a few duds but he's also made some great signings for us as well. The Zarate thing has really summed up our season - it's a mess.

Traoré was one of his guests.

I can't believe that this far into the Fernandes era, we still haven't got someone with a spine going on the warpath to straighten some of these scumbags out. It's insane. Utterly insane.

If the confidence of the remaining players is indeed that low, then that might be what kills us of completely (as if we're not already dead and buried). On BT Sport last night Barton was on the panel of pundits prior to the Marseille-Lyon game and he looked pretty gloomy.",2015-03-16

There's also the impending financial mystery and the complete squad overhaul necessary. I'm not sure what their plans are - will Ferdinand assemble the essentials of a squad himself? Will they allow whoever comes in a few additions of their own? I'd say they're more likely to bring in someone with off-the-shelf relationships that they can call upon to quickly flesh out the squad. I hated that about Harry, but this time it looks like it might be a necessary evil.

"[Here's an overview of most of the contract situatiuon](http://www.indyrs.co.uk/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=16006). One of the biggest headaches I see actually comes from two players who have flown under the radar in the wake of more outrageous player contract/performance ratios - Onuoha and Hoilett. They both signed at a time when contracts were very generous indeed, and they'll both be collecting on these for another year. In this impending future of severe cutbacks, these two will probably be collecting the equivalent salaries of 2-3 players each.

There are a couple of stupid deals which will be even more eye-watering in the brave new world - Taarabt, Caulker, Sandro and Fer. I can imagine the latter three might be saleable but the day might arrive when we let Taarabt go on a free (fuck you Levy and your 40% sell on clause) or, lamentably, loan him back to Italy while subsidising his very steep salary.

At this point I think Yun has done enough wrong as well as right to throw off any suitors. We might be facing a logjam with Robinson coming back though. I have no idea what Robinson's playing style is. Given that we'll almost certainly be lumbered with Onuoha, they I'd go out and pick up a fresh leader at the back. They need someone vocal and authoritative to compliment the other three. At this stage I don't think Dunne can stay functional for long enough. At this stage Ehmer should be making up the numbers.

Hopefully Phillips stays. I'd spend the entirety of the Summer training sessions converting Traoré into a left-winger. I'd keep Henry for the middle, but I have my doubts about him being the charismatic leader to bark at people from the midfield. Not sure what you'd do about Barton. No-one will offer him wages close to anything like he's getting right now. He's just had a house built in Richmond, has a lot of media activities and is doing his degree. He'd probably be down for hanging around locally, so there might be a deal to be had. It largely depends on who the manager will be though - with Barton you'll always be on the lookout for a personality clash. Doughty and maybe Manning can make up the numbers. It would be nice to have Faurlin back for another season but I don't think the club is in a position to be rolling out pity contracts any more, so it would have to be for a Faurlin who can contribute.

Third season on the trot that we'll be in urgent need of extra firepower!

"Just doing some research on strikers because i have the time. Michiel Kramer seems a very good target man/poacher with good positioning.

Some serious defensive errors that need to be worked on, especially on set-pieces where we can't seem to beat the opponents to the header. That third goal should not have got through and Yun was quite poor in general. I don't see us winning more away fixtures, Sunderland's performance today shows why we were successful against them.

Also a possible inclusion in the Euro 2016 squad. Maybe I should be sad he might not be the first player in ages to wear both the England shirt and the Hoops in the same season.

I think we have to be realistic on Ramsey. There appears to be an understanding in place that he isn't a shoe-in for the permanent gig, and this is for the best. I don't want to be harsh with him, but at the same time I don't want to give him a free pass simply because his predecessor jumped ship in the early hours after having all of his deadline day deals fall through.

Yun does look good. I'd be happier if he could get a few more left-footed crosses in though, but then again it's not as if he's had a long run of games to formulate some kind of understanding with a regular left winger ahead of him.",2015-03-09

"Squint. Each colour of the pie represents a player, with the size of the slice indicating how many of the team's league goals they've bagged.

Ridiculous proportion of the goals attributed to one player for QPR.

Note that QPR are the only Premier League team for 14/15 to score all their goals in one competition, as a result of the impotence against Burton Albion and Sheffield Utd.

This data is a little more grim when you consider Fer's injury.

They need to source potential goal scorers this summer - up front, from the middle and probably at least one on the wing. It should be a busy window, and hopefully the days of deadline day stupidity are behind us.",2015-03-06
"Based on this I predict a 4-4-2 with a midfield composed of a crust of Phillips and Kranjcar and a creamy centre of Henry and Sandro.

"tl;dr ""we need 37-40 points"". Well, file that under ""things we already knew.""

What's more interesting is how we're going to get them. On the 1st of Jan we drew 1-1 with Swansea at home, bringing us to 19 points. If we take 40 points to be the threshold for safety, that means we were still missing 21 points, which is equal to 7 wins. So, during the 2nd half of the season, we need to win 7 times (or 6, and 3 draws; or 5, and 6 draws, and so on until we run out of available fixtures), in order to reach 40 points.

Since that game against Swansea we've managed to pick up only 3 points with the win against Sunderland. This means we now need 6 wins from our remaining 13 games. Let's have a look at which those remaining fixtures are:

* Sat 21 Feb - Hull (A)

* Wed 4 Mar - Arsenal (H)

* Sat 7 Mar - Tottenham (H)

* Sat 14 Mar - Crystal Palace (A)

* Sat 21 Mar - Everton (H)

* Sat 4 Apr - West Brom (A)	

* Sat 11 Apr - Chelshit (H)

* Sat 18 Apr - Aston Villa (A)

* Sat 25 Apr - West Ham (H)

* Sat 2 May - Liverpool (A)

* Sat 9 May - Man City (A)	

* Sat 16 May - Newcastle United (H)	

* Sun 24 May - Leicester (A)

There are five fixtures in there that stand out as being especially tough -- Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelski, Liverpool and City. If we assume that we lose those, that gives us 8 games out of which to get 6 wins. 

Since it's difficult to imagine that happening, the only alternative is that we have to cause some upsets against the big teams. Three of those five tough games are at home, though, and we'll have a go against anyone at Loftus Road. Anyway, summa summarum, we need to cause upsets against the big teams to reach that 40-point mark to have a realistic chance at surviving.",2015-02-17

"I wouldn't rule out another twist in the tale this season. The odds are now stacked against us surviving, but it's not as bad as people are making out. Our squad is decent. Our ground is tough for top teams to play at (sometimes), and while our away form is now infamous the only reason for it is Redknapp's tactical incapability. Playing away from home when you are one of the league's worst teams is all about having a plan, sticking to it, and giving maximum effort. Those are three attributes that Redknapp was never capable of providing. We now have a run of home fixtures against top teams where we will be fighting for our lives - don't be surprised to see an upset or two. At the same time we will be on the road to some of the lesser teams, without the manager who has cocked up every away game of the entire season. 

It's not likely, but it's not impossible. And if it does happen, prepare yourselves for all the commentors and journos who are writing us off now acting like they predicted it all along - 'no I'm not surprised to see QPR climb up nearer mid-table, with that squad it's what you would expect' etc etc,",2015-02-08
"For all the frustrations, this season has been fascinating and exciting. I can't take my eyes off this team for one moment. Regardless of the outcome, the club has been tremendously entertaining! COYRs!",2015-02-08
Would rather see Hill at CB than Ferdinand to be honest.,2015-02-08
"Looking back on yesterday, I think we were good for a point. Infuriating result aside, some of Taarabt's work was worth the price of admission alone. Get him properly match fit (if possible) and the others in tune with him and who knows? As it stands a few of his passes went nowhere because the others weren't positioned to receive them. As soon as the ball is heading towards him, that's the time to anticipate what is going to happen, where you need to be and start running there.

Phillips had his best game in a while I thought. There's a decent cross in there, it's just beating his man that looks to be a problem.

I worry that Redknapp has broken Traoré. Different tasks, different positions, inconsistent selection. It saddens me because at the very least, this guy wants to be in London. His level of English is pretty indicative of how settled he is here and if only he could slot into a team unit as opposed to getting rinsed on lack of talent/confidence/match speed, we might have a nice, loyal player there. I hope the new guys don't bomb him out completely again. At least he should be here next year, and under the FFP circumstances I can see him getting a long run in the team no matter what.

Zarate looked pretty encouraging, although maybe he was just playing with a point to prove. Let's not be pessimistic though, perhaps there's a decent player in there who can ball a few goals. He certainly seemed to have the legs for it.

You just can't be lining up with Hill at leftback from the get-go. On top of being unreliable for supporting  attacking phases, he's a card risk as he is very hands-on in his defending, clawing at his man. Let's see how Yun does.

Personal opinion, but Onuoha needs a run at centreback, as he needs as much matchtime practicing being a pinball flipper as possible. Again yesterday, I thought his footwork on the ball isn't all that. Apparently he might be injured too though, so we might have superman Ferdinand to look forward to. Frankly that's a thought that terrifies me.

Based on yesterday's performance and system, I think Barton's retention over Henry is the right call. Give Fer some more time playing central, and maybe we'll have our best looking midfield for this final stretch.

In a way I think the next two matches are reasonably benign - there are scarier away matches I can think of than Sunderland and Hull. If we are going to survive, I think it has to be at the expense of Hull. Pray to your gods that Villa somehow defeat them (with an own goal?). They have a cluster of matches from Chelsea to Arsenal that might well sink their battleship. It would also be nice if Burnley stuck to the script and lost to Man U and Southampton. Leicester's next four games might see them well and truly cut adrift.

That final day of the season - Leicester vs. QPR and Villa vs. Burnley might be a heart stopper.

If we do go down, is Sherwood really the right man? Does he want a Championship gig? Given the player exodus (awesome planning from those in charge), impending fines, etc. I on no way expect to come close to bouncing back. They'd be looking at building a squad on the cheap (free signings) and within the reasonably tight confines of QPR's ordinary means. I hope it's something they are seriously thinking about - now is the time to start thinking about out of contract players who won't be wanting big money and can play within a set system. Maybe one or two promising players from Leagues One and Two. We'll be begging a loan player or two from the Premier League. The era of throwing money around for short-term fixes should be well and truly over. Then we'll see the true extent of the owners' patience.",2015-02-08
Probably for the best that we get an idea of what the squad can do without him at this point. I'm glad to get a breather - he's gone off the boil recently and hasn't scored from open play in a long while. Time to see what the other men up front can do.,2015-02-08

"Unless something goes wrong I guess it's Sherwood. Given Ferdinand and Ramsey's presence there probably isn't too much point getting worked up over it. I just hope we don't end up with personality clashes - Barton, Taarabt, Rio Ferdinand, all big characters. Fingers crossed they all play nice.

I can't believe any Championship manager with a hope of hitting the top 6 would consider switching to steering Redknapp's squad through a relegation scrap. I can't imagine the board having a broad spectrum of targets in mind.",2015-02-04

I reckon Howe and McClaren would turn us down, probably looking to get a bigger Premiership team off the back of promotion.

I think we'd have a chance with Gary Rowett, he hasn't been at Birmingham long I know but he's never getting them promoted, maybe Karanka would come as well. We're not that unattractive a prospect really but if we get Sherwood I'm certain we'll go down.",2015-02-04

"I'd avoid the Lower School End, as it seems to have become the touristy stand.

When you look at the seat map for choosing where you want to sit, you should be able to distinguish a pattern in the the South Africa Road and Ellerslie Road stands - there are diagonal lines of available seats. The reason they are available and not taken by ST holders is that they have views restricted by the support columns for the roof. Best avoided.

Otherwise staptiudupe has given you agood summary. That P, Q, R and S corner should be noisy. Upper Loft good views. Front of any block in the SAR stand good.

I can't imagine the Platinum seats being anything special to be honest.",2015-02-02
"It doesn't really matter a huge amount, tbh, so I wouldn't advise paying too much. Go for a silver or gold ticket and save some beer money. I prefer the South Africa Road stand to the Ellerslie Road stand, you're generally closer to the pitch and have a great view if you're around the T block. I sit in the N upper block, behind the QPR goal. I say 'QPR goal' - QPR always attack the Loft end in the second half as it's the 'home' end.",2015-02-02
"For me i'd recommend the Paddocks and choose as close to the dugouts as possible. As long as you're close to them and towards the back of the Paddock the dugout 'obstructs' the view (it really doesn't) and the stewards let you stand. Away team in the West Paddock, QPR East.  

If it works out you'll be close to the players, squad, and physios. It can be pretty fun watching their reactions and having a joke with them if you're close enough. Photos are fine but within moderation.

"There's no point at this stage. It's the end of the January window, so the new man would have no time to change the team. Anyone we would have considered as a replacement wouldn't be interested/has been snapped up. 

I feel we're stuck with Harry till the end. What happens if we go down is that he leaves 100% and we can start building a club. We stay up, I reckon he gets another year. ",2015-01-31
"Agreed.  He is sentimental and old-fashioned, and its incredibly frustrating to watch.  Since day 1, there has been no clear sense of tactics.  With a side thats mid-table on paper and in all reports hard-working and dedicated, it is completely the managers fault if they are unorganized, sloppy, and playing without unity and purpose.

We don't even look like we're playing in the same league as other teams.  I watched a replay of Burnley and Man City, that great game a few weeks back and I was amazed with how Burnley played.  They played exactly like a relegation team should play: pace, purpose, crunching tackles, and general chemistry.  We dont have that. Or anything close to that, and its 100% Redknapps fault.

On a side, I think we're garbage in the center of the park.  Henry is good for nothing more than hard work, and Barton makes far too many mistakes and giveaways to be considered a true playmaker.  Week after week those two get overrun, and it'll be a blessing when the glass man Sandro returns.",2015-01-31

"Just a quick point since this is a new post. Manning didn't play for the under 21's this week. Maybe he could make his way into the bench. Very hopeful, but somewhat possible.

We don't need any more striker or midfielders in my opinion. A right winger would do us good, but it isn't a necessity. A LB is what we need for cover. 

Big game against Stoke, just like every other fixture this season if we want to survive.",2015-01-27
"I agree with all this. I would add that our reliance on Zamora has led to us resting him for away games - when we rely on him most. If we could get a striker who can hold the ball up as well as Bobby then we can play the same tactics away from home as we do at Loftus Road. If we'd played like we did against Utd last week in our away games - same tactics, same application - we'd be way up the table. 

Realistically what we can expect is Redknapp waiting until the 11th hour then bringing in the best player he can find for the best price, regardless of where he plays. ",2015-01-27
"I honestly wouldn't do anything. We've gotten our one additional striker in Zarate and any other pieces we try to bring in will take time to gel. I know that there are numerous occasions where a January signing have saved a season for teams but i just don't see it being anyone but the players who are here, who can do it. 
In the past 3 years, this team played best when they were a ""band of brothers"", and maybe my faith is blind, but i do have faith in our players to keep us safe from relegation. 
People have been questioning whether Yun is good enough and saying his form slipped before injury, but his injury was nagging and he was probably playing in pain for a few games. ",2015-01-27
"While he would bring goals and definite experience to the team, I would be very worried about his wage as well as his general attitude. He's fallen out with Pochettino and Villas Boas before that, and before that at Man City and Arsenal.

I would imagine he'd have a similar situation to Remy if he came, but I don't think we would get a resell value. Especially if we get relegated.",2015-01-23
"I just can't see why Arry thinks we need more strikers. we've scored more goals than half the league but conceded more than everyone. That would tell me that it's the defence that needs work. 

Anyway, I've seen links to Osvaldo (who has attitude/anger problems), Pato (who's more injury prone than Faurlin) and Essien (who must be about 50 now, no matter what his birth certificate says) today. I honestly cannot see where any of these players is going to add any value. I'm extremely pessimistic right now. ",2015-01-23
"Where else did we think we would be, other than at the bottom in a relegation fight with 7 or 8 other clubs?  Our home form is better than expected and our away form worse.

Talks about massively inflated contracts and doesn't even give one example.  A less than quick Google search also reveals no official information with respect to the talked about players' actual wages.  In fact, we shipped out all the players we could on exorbitant wages but those past mistakes still weigh heavy on us.

We spent more than Burnley and Leicester, of course we did, we had to.  Unlike those two clubs, we had no cohesive core of top-flight calibre players.  Caulker, Isla and Fer have been great for us.  When Sandro was fit he contributed as well.

The only point he makes that I agree with is that Redknapp cannot count our strikers.",2015-01-21

> [Harry has]...consistently under achieved with this squad of players...

Unlike most managers Harry cannot complain about the support the board has given him. 

We've out spent all the club's around us and we were by far the top spending club in the Championship. ",2015-01-14
"In 2012/2013 Redknapp did whatever he could to try to save the team from relegation.  A team that didn't want to be together for god sakes, I think the words ""toxic dressing room"" were thrown about.  He got in Remy, who turned out to be fantastic, and definitely worth the money he was getting.  Samba, not so much, but we did recoup our money on him.  The end of the season comes along and with it relegation.  The squad churn for the next season looks like this:

In: Dunne, Simpson, Austin, O'Neil, Kranjcar, Assou-Ekotto, Henry, Carroll, Phillips, Benayoun, Doyle.

Out: M'Bia, Granero, Park, Bosingwa, Mackie, Fabio, Diakite.  Not including the retirement of Derry and Nelsen.

For a grand total of 18 players who came into and left the squad.  That has a terrible effect on cohesion and chemistry and the fact we were still able to achieve promotion is a master class on the part of Redknapp in my opinion.  Not only that but the atmosphere in the change room improved dramatically, something which, as I said, plagued us in 2012/2013.  So the end of the season comes and we absolutely barely achieve promotion, with a side that did not have enough quality to compete in the top flight.

So we come back back for the 2014/2015 season and with the exception of Mutch and thus far, Ferdinand, Redknapp injects quality into the side in the form of Fer, Isla, Vargas, Caulker and Sandro.  We lose an ungodly amount of away games, albeit to top sides, and maintain a fairly decent home record.  Then we lose to Burnley away, arguably the one team we should've been able to get points from, due to an uncharacteristically bad performance, and we all go off the chain and call for Redknapp's head.

Regardless of what anyone says, the club has made progress since two years ago.  I remember watching the games in 2012/2013 and being disgusted with our lack of work ethic and overall perception that no one cared.  I have not had those same feelings this year, regardless of our garbage performance at Burnley.",2015-01-14
"My gut reaction is that this is bollocks. Man United? Really? It's one of those home games we'd be lucky to get a point out of.

"I consider myself optimistic, yet realistic when it comes down to QPR. The issue is that I feel that there is a huge game of 'tug of war' being played with the fans, the team and Harry redknapp. We have a brilliant home record, undoubtably good for a team that is fighting for survival, but we cannot take anything from an away game? We spend and spend and change and change, but still cannot find a solution. We get excited at prospects in Vargas, Sandro and Taarabt. Then we get thrown some media bullshit b/w HR and Taarabt, before him being selected for a HUGE game against Burnley, a game that can restore form and optimism about our future. HR is never questioned about the tactics behind our play and always provides general comments that have been stated a million times already. We bring in Rio and Vargas, for them to be replaced by Zamora and Dunne. We get rid of Simpson, whilst being short for cover.

All I have to say is that I can understand fans frustration, as I have had a bad feeling in my stomach since the Burnley game which will probably last until we are out of the relegation zone. I appreciate what HR has done. Yes we have an expensive team, yes on paper we should be winning games left, right and centre, but he has sorted this team out. HR is not very inspiring, which is what QPR lack right now in management as TF, a man I look to for positivity, is in a world of his own. Maybe HR should be looking at retirement by the end of the year or sooner, not because he isn't necessarily good as a manager, but he seems out of sorts in terms of passion and inspiration.

We just need take a breather, and really look at getting 3 points with the players we have, not taking relying on loans to get us over the line.

"Apparently some of the folks coming back on the train yesterday bust out a ""we're going down with the Harry"" chant. We're handcuffed to him and sinking is the sensation I get. Take a look at the fixture list to the right there - the schedule is brutal now. While I don't trust any alleged QPR ITK accounts that much (take a gander at [@hillmania](https://twitter.com/hillmania)'s tweets yesterday for some food for thought) , there are enough stories flying around that even if you connect the dots for a handful, it seems we are indeed out of serious transfer funds to make any drastic additions. With relegation on the cards, there'd be no point in signing someone up to a lengthy contract anyway.

When you look at how Swansea and Southampton have built themselves up into established Premier League teams, it seriously makes you wonder just what the maniacs running the asylum are playing at. when you consider the obscene, obscene, obscene resources that have been pumped into QPR. £200mn worth of debt later, there's absolutely nothing to show for it. Haphazard team selections, the oldest manager going with no apparent tactical convictions, and owner hopelessly devoted to him, woefully unbalanced squads of players, not a brick laid for a new training ground, so much talk, so little action. How much will it suck watching Austin in another club's shirt next season?

We'll right in the middle of a traffic jam of clubs, and have a bigger squad than any of them, so as the season wears on we have an advantage there. We have a goalscorer - essential if you're going to dig your way out of the bottom of the table. Our home form is still good. Those points indicate that although we're not going to achieve the mid-table security that we should, we will pick up enough points to stay in touch with the league and, with a bit of luck, survive. Beyond that, who knows, but it'll be a lot easier to restructure if we're still in the league.",2015-01-11

All I can say about them is that they'll never appreciate how great Bobby's goal in May and the first promotion in 2011 were. Goosebumps.

"Had a good laugh at the Christmas video mention. Didn't have a chance to catch the game, and I'm not too disappointed I didn't. Hoilett needs to go.

Some players that started today need a wake up call pronto.",2015-01-04
"I liked what I saw from Mutch, probably our only bright spark today. I'm sick of Hoillett getting a free ride and playing every game because of our lack of wide options. If we didn't have so many other needs to cover, I'd put buying a winger top of our list. The difference between him and Vargas is mental.

Ferdinand was a poor buy as well, we keep shafting ourselves when we bring in famous defenders, first Samba now Rio. We look Championship level without Caulker.

I still think we'll stay up, hopefully Harry can actually bring in what we need rather than one of his old Spurs mates and we can push on. Runaway Train is a great tune btw.",2015-01-04

"I remember a few years ago after Redknapp won the FA Cup with Portsmouth but got them relegated too, and there was a radio phone-in asking Portsmouth fans whether they'd rather have stayed up and not won the FA Cup instead of winning it and getting relegated, and opinion was very divided. Obviously looking at the position of their club now they would have perhaps not ended up in League Two had they still remained in the Premier League benefiting from all the TV money, but some say that winning the FA Cup is a day that you'll never forget and for fans of smaller clubs will quite possibly never be seen again in your lifetime. If you ask Mandaric or whoever the chairman was it'd be a no-brainer but for the fans it's a more difficult decision. As a fan I'd love to see us win the FA Cup even if we did go down, and to be honest I think it'd be quite interesting to see what would happen if we did get relegated to the Conference or whatever is currently being touted, it'd be a great story and it'd be great to be the biggest team in a small pond(s). And I don't really buy the argument that it's a drain on the team, it's only five extra games at the end of the day and it's not like the League Cup where it's midweek and players could suffer from a lack of rest - weekends are devoted to the FA Cup and that wouldn't have a noticeable effect on player fatigue for me, obviously there's the occupational hazards of injuries but that comes with the package. Considering we've only won two games in fourteen years in the FA Cup according to a post I read today I think we're due a decent run sometime soon.",2015-01-03

Chelsea Came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at the Nou Camp after going down to 10, we beat Derby with 10 men, Swansea only scored after they went down to 10. Going down to 10 can instill spirit in a team and make the other side get overconfident.

Since then...I don't see how he fits any tactical scheme we've wheeled out. Frustrating, and expensive. Browsing Cardiff forums it seems a common knock against him was becoming anonymous in midfield (Jermaine Jenas like). Might be accurate.

"C. 

I agree with your player assessments but would add Zamora to those performing with distinction, he deserves a fair chunk of the credit that Charlie is getting. That 2nd goal against West Brom is the perfect example - the header from Dunne came back to Bobby off the bar, about a yard from goal, but instead of instinctively heading it back towards goal he knew where Charlie was and squared it to him. Everyone (rightly) praised Charlie for being in the right place, and for his striker's instinct, but equally important there is Zamora suppressing his own striker's instinct for the benefit of the team.

One aspect of the season that is pleasing is that we appear to be learning from past mistakes - something we've always been terrible at in the past. We ditched the 3-5-2 early on; we appear to have more modest ambitions and are capable of scrapping. In our relegation season, lest we forget, we were modelled as a boutique club playing flowing attacking football - it was all about style, and we got trounced by savvy, superior sides. We still need to figure out how to shut games down, particularly away from home and in the final 20 mins, when we've conceded a lot of goals. We do not set up well defensively and have conceded way too many goals. If we can bring that 'goals against' column down, we should be fine. ",2014-12-29
"There's 7 or 8 teams that will be scrapping it. Harry is right in saying it, there's no way we can tell what's going to happen, we will find out on the last day of the season. 

Agree with your ratings, though I'm not sure if I'd give Onuoha an honourable mention just yet; he hasn't convinced me. I have a feeling when Sandro is back in our midfield him and Barton will be a force! There is plenty of reason for encouragement, at least when you take into consideration how miserable our EPL experiences usually are. 

That Burnley game is going to be absolutely massive. I've got to be honest I would probably take a point. If we could somehow get a win from there it would be a huge result.",2014-12-29
"I think we've just equalled the record for consecutive away losses for the equivalent period in any of the previous two decades' Premier League campaigns? Considering we've spent a fair bit of money, I'd mark the season as a C, weighted upwards based on respectable home form.

However taken as a group, I would have expected at least a win and a draw somewhere.",2014-12-29
"I think it's safe to say that we'll be in the mix to avoid relegation this season. If we pick up a few points away, we could get a bit clear of the relegation zone. Any drop in home form and we'll be right back down there. I'd give us a C+ for the first half of the season, since we are barely passing but not doing as well as hoped. 

My worry is the january transfer window. Obviously reinforcements would be a huge help in several areas, but if we bring in mercenaries or slackers, it has the potential to ruin the team spirit. Let's hope we don't do anything too desperate. The summer transfers were good , so I'm optimistic. It's a good sign that we didn't rush into buying an inferior last minute replacement for Remy.",2014-12-29

I think West Ham have only sent him to us on the basis that we pay his whole wage (around £40k from what I've read), as Sam wants to bring in more players. 

Otherwise, I'm happy with this deal. I think Zarate is a type of forward who is different from who we currently have (I.e. Austin & Zamora combo). I also think this works in our favour as it means Zarate won't be playing for any relegation rivals (he was linked with Sunderland and West Brom I think). ",2014-12-29

"Really bad performance. We're seeing the effects of the overreliance on Charlie Austin. As soon as he got the ball there was a sharp intake of breath from everyone around me, even if he was only by the cornerflag. 

He's a bloody great player, but he's a poacher, not a magician. He'll get us goals but not in the way that Taarabt did. He won't randomly turn on the magic and score a goal on his own from a seemingly impossible situation, but if you leave him lurking in the box and you feed him he'll get you something. 

The entire team needs to work if Charlie is to work. People need to be pumping in balls into the box, delivering something to his feet or head. But no one did. There were no real chances ""created"" as such by us the entire game. 

Barton was poor. Fer was worse. But worst of all was Zamora, who won precisely nothing all game long. We need to start transitioning away from the ""hoof it to Bobby"" strategy, I think. It's not exactly a recipe for long term success. 

And therein the problem with Harry. He just doesn't have the tactical mind to make that kind of a change. We played his beloved 4-4-2 with two strikers and two wingers who can run at their defenders, and the rest of them can just fackin' run around a bit. The problem is that Hoilett and Philips just aren't good enough. And we have no plan b.

Most alarming of all is that we have now had all the ""easy"" home games, and now come the ""easy"" away games. Which means we have to win away or beat mid and top table teams at home. It'll be a tough second half of the season, especially remembering that we'll need a big points cushion for the difficult run-in. Hope Harry has his eyes on some good transfer targets this January.

Traore. Ugh. It was also extremely frustrating to see Hoilett get himself into good positions only to make horrible crosses.,2014-12-26
"First away game I've been to since Chelsea. Nice to see the away faithful are already on board with the gallows humour. Traoré was the villain of choice today. I hate knocking the guy but he should have been pencilled in as a permanent winger years ago. This leftback malarkey isn't his forté. I couldn't join in with the disdain for him but even I burst out laughing when he miscued a pass at the start of the second. As he is such a confidence player this could have been catastrophic for him - maybe he'll be Palace bound after all. Strikes me as a real headache now as occasional superhero cameos aside, I don't think Hill can be first choice at leftback. The left wing was awful until Hoilett came on - at least he put in a few crosses, terrible though the weighting might have been.

Not really convinced by the Niko-Mutch-Henry trio, and I'm once again at a loss as to what Mutch is, and why we paid so...*Mutch* for him.

Pinball football until we concede, with a little extra oomph towards the end. They've put a lot of presure on themselves for the Burnley match now, and that lot might not have the xmas generosity to drop to 10 men.

It was nice to be in with a chance until the final whistle at least, and thank god Isla was back. Caulker and Vargas are quality players.

Edit: I should add that it's infuriating to see players standing around waiting for the ball...you need more clever attacking runs as options for a pass. Hoilett, I'm looking at you. You beat your man respectably a few times today, but you could've got away more cleanly if you zipped forward more often.",2014-12-26

"Charlie Austin: first he lays his bricks, then he fucks your bitch.",2014-12-20
"This is the kind of game where, if Charlie were suspended here instead of against Everton, or his shoulder had gone, we'd have lost 2-0 and we'd all be saying ""oh god it's just like last time."" Instead we're 15th place, more goals scored than Liverpool, and we've finally reached the 1:1 games:points ratio. 

The referee may have fucked us today but we had our fair share of good fortune. On the balance of the chances, they were arguably slightly better, I thought. Our defending was so bad that those two goals could just as well have been own goals. But when we kicked off at 2-0 down I saw the players hyping each other up and fistpumping in a 'come on' fashion. Even 2-0 down we have the spirit at home to keep fighting. Old QPR would've just given up. 

The Vargas substitution for Hoilett irritated me. Vargas was ineffective in the first half but as the game opened up in the second he started finding space and running at his defender. Then Harry subbed him off, at the worst possible time. Meanwhile Fer wad having a pretty poor game but was allowed to continue for the full 90 minutes. It really should've been Fer for Hoilett imo. That way we would've had the pace threat on both flanks.

Aside from that I'd like to whinge at a few more things, such as the sloppy passes in midfield, and the complete absence of the right winger and defender in the first half. I think it goes to show how essential starting Isla and Vargas together is, since that flank is usually one of our biggest threats, but today both Vargas and Onuoha looked rather clueless. 

Of course I'm delighted with the points but we weren't as good as the scoreline shows. We have Charlie and the Loftus Road x-factor to thank for a lot. If that can get us points against Swansea and Palace, and we can mend some gaps in the squad in January -- someone to share Charlie's goal scoring duties and another right back -- I really, really think we're going to stay up. 
",2014-12-20
"What a win! Can't help but look back to that time we came back to beat Liverpool 3-2 and turn our season around. I don't enjoy going behind so often and giving teams this many chances, but we play with such an intensity and togetherness that it makes games at LR an absolute joy to watch. Some of the most exciting games of the season have been played there, 3-2 feels like an average result! So proud of our attitude to come back and win. Great team spirit!

Agree with your point about Hill OP. In different respects, him and Kranjcar are superb at slowing the game down. Kranjcar provides the cool head we need to close the game down (his importance is really understated) while Hill makes himself known with his aggression in battling. It was nice to see him back in the team.

Henry wasn't at his best, but I'll let that slide. I've been really impressed by the way he's worked his way into the team. Not his best performance but certainly not a bad one. Barton was fantastic, he's slowly getting back to his best since his injury. Vargas was unimpressive for me again. He needs to remind us what he's capable of. 

At the back it felt like roles were reversed to day. Onuoha was solid, but Dunne and Caulker were all over the place at times. Berahino almost punished us at the end there. I was shocked to see us go down 2-0 at home. There will come a time when teams will hang onto their leads after going ahead here, we've managed to get the 3 points against Leicester and WBA but maybe next time we won't be so lucky. Not their best days.

Charlie Austin ... what is there that needs saying? Give that man a contract.",2014-12-20
"I love Charlie, but I think our team is starting to have a dangerous reliance on him. We need a team of good players, not just a single amazing player. While we've got him, though, he's gonna pretty much keep us up.",2014-12-20
"My disjointed thoughts: 

I don't know if I'd agree with the Fer assessment in this game. I thought he was poor when we were chasing the game, but great for holding the ball up when we were up, this could also have to do with the fact that he was moved into a central role which suits him a lot more than the left wing role. 

These are the kinds of games that we do need to win to stay up, 3 points in the return fixture would also be great.

I also think that Zamora was fantastic in the game, in terms of being a nuisance. We were also missing Isla at times, his link up with Vargas is a lot better than Neddie's. 

The ref also had a really strange game, he was calling everything at the start and in the first half, than had 20 minutes in the second where he let the game flow. It was weird. 

Finally, a personal highlight was getting sung at by the West Brom fans. Never a dull moment. ",2014-12-20
Yun was in so much discomfort he didn't even celebrate when the penalty went in.,2014-12-20
I don't think that we will have an issue with holding on to him for the next couple years. He is playing Premier League football for a club that adores him. You can listen to all the QPR podcasts and all the old QPR players that come on always say that their best time playing football was with QPR. Where would Charlie go next but to a mid-table team currently? I've always loved you Charlie.,2014-12-20
"Someone on a forum elsewhere mentioned that a few weeks ago Hoddle was on a Bein sports show as a guest and gave a straight-talking assessment of Austin, saying that he is quite a limited player. He is a poacher, and that's good in that the instinct for goals and work ethic are things that are hard to coach, but the other technical aspects of his game are limited. That being the case, you'd hope that most of the top teams would be hard pressed to fit him into their schemes.",2014-12-20
"Heres two reasons:

1. He likes QPR.
2. We can pay wages on parr with the top clubs (we have more money that most clubs in our position). The only reason Remy left was because we had to sell him if a club was willing to pay £10m (it was part of his contract). If we give him a big contract no one below the top clubs will be able to poach him from us, we only have to sell him if we want too and I can't see Charlie pulling a Taarabt (i.e refusing to play).",2014-12-20

Our only out-and out-striker scores a hat-trick, winning the game for us and taking us well clear of relegation for the first time in months. Instead of celebrating we say it's inevitable he'll leave the club and his shoulder is about to go anyway.
You've made me feel better about myself.

PS: The secret to keeping hold of Austin is to ensure he signs his new contract and not to sell him.",2014-12-20

"Something my dad figured out: 

""A lot has been made of QPR’s inability to get points on the road – it’s actually not surprising at all because the R’s have an extremely fluky schedule where all of their away fixtures in the first half of the season are against sides in the top half of the table – literally all of them!  Here are the current table positions of the teams we’ve played on the road so far, in chronological order:  7,3,5,4,1,8,9,10 – and we’re rounding out the first-half away schedule at #6 Arsenal. 
 
The average table position of teams QPR played at home in the first half is 13.9 and the average position of away opponents is 5.9.  That’s really weird and fluky.""",2014-12-17

"1) Joey's one of our better players. He's got great vision, but sometimes his passes are overambitious. As for the foul resulting in the goal, well, that's just football. Fouls happen, sometimes they lead to goals. 

2) Not much doubt about that being Charlie Austin, I don't think? Dunne has been outstanding as well for us. Vargas has really settled. We're a different team with Barton on the pitch, I feel. But I still think Charlie stands out.

3) Yun's been great. He's really solved the left-back woes we've had for so long. Can get forwards when needed but he's not one of those fullbacks who are basically more adapted to LM than LB. He does his defensive duties well.

4) We're a completely different team away from home, as you probably already know. Having Charlie suspended was a huge blow for us as well. With both him and Zamora out, our attack was basically brand new, which I think explains the cluelessness. 

5) Loft For Words. Clive Whittingham is great. Also on the podcast, which you should definitely listen to.

"/u/Godhatesfats has given you decent answers already, but I'll chime in too.

1. Barton is a character. I quite like the guy. I've repeated myself a lot in saying that I think he is probably on twice the salary his talent level deserves, but he will put his body on the line for the squad. That counts for a lot. I'd rather he hung back in matches though, as I don't think he represents any great attacking threat.

2. Austin would probably command the highest transfer fee and is crucial to winning games. Beyond him, I'd always look to include Vargas, Fer and Caulker in the squad.

3. I've been hoping he'd come good since he signed almost two years ago now. It took for-fucking-ever to get his chance, but I'm glad that he became pretty much the undisputed first choice LB as soon as he put in decent displays at this level. His last game was a bit dodgy, but if he was flawless he probably wouldn't be at QPR.

4. You'll find serious differences in opinion on Redknapp. I won't lie, I dislike the guy. He has a long rap sheet of transgressions in my book, both within and without QPR. It is what it is though, and he is the man at the wheel.

5. I'll second [Loft For Words](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/), which I think is hands down the best fan produced content. The previews, match reports, opposition profiles etc are fantastic, and the forum is one of the most active as well. [Independent R's](http://www.indyrs.co.uk/) and [QPR Report](http://qprreport.blogspot.co.uk/) both put out quiet a lot of stuff. I begrudge QPR Report for holding the @QPR Twitter handle hostage though.

In terms of media, with QPR it's always best to stick to the hyper local outlets - [West London Sport](http://www.westlondonsport.com/category/qpr) and [Get West London](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-rangers-fc).

Apologies to any of you others who read this that I omitted.

I also second the Open All R's podcast.",2014-12-16
"Everton away was always going to be difficult. The bad fortune with the deflections didn't help either. We played well. Not well enough to win, but well enough to be optimistic -- just as with the Chelsea defeat, and the Swansea defeat, and the Newcastle defeat. We aren't just capitulating anymore. There's improvement. When the more 'winnable' away games roll around, I expect us to turn the trend. We just have to take this one on the chin and keep making the Loftus Road magic happen for now. If we can keep this splendid home form going and pick up just a few wins away, even if it's just against the other bottom teams, we'll survive.",2014-12-16
"I certainly approved of the formation. It was a bit more dynamic having real wingers as opposed the the table football 4-4-2 style with Fer, Kranjcar or Barton on the midfield edges.

> the third reminding us that no matter how good a shot-stopper Green is, he's still prone to those mistakes.

That was the fatal blow for me - game over after that.

Listening to the 5 live podcast of the post-match reactions, the pundits and an Everton fan were actually quite complimentary of how we played. It was certainly a better showing than the Swansea match, where I thought we were battered senseless despite the 2-0 scoreline.

We're only two weeks from the window opening now. I hope everyone at the club is on the same page with regards to requirements and targets.",2014-12-16
"What do you mean by this? I feel that the players are playing to win, everyone seems to put an effort in and seem dedicated.",2014-12-16
"Too many sloppy balls for this league. We'll sink ourselves making those mistakes. I'd say Phillips needs to be playing elsewhere in January, be it on loan or otherwise, but that would leave us short due to the tardy realisation that it's perhaps a bit wiser not to overpay on a weekly basis and monitor transfer spend. I'll be eternally suspicious of Hoilett's vision and hamstring, but he showed today why I am a bit mystified that Fer has been consistently played on the left instead of him. Joey Barton should probably be getting a weekly salary on a level with Henry. I'm not sure what Mutch does yet. A younger, slightly faster version of Gary O'Neil?

On the positive side, Vargas has some beautiful footwork. I also think Fer has some great technique, but I worry that people will turn on him like they did to Mbia. They also didn't drop their heads at 3-0 - it could have been worse if they had packed it in, and with every shitty away result like this, I think goal difference might well come into play during those last few games. I thought we were OK for periods, like OP says. Maybe it would've been a different game had we scored when we were looking menacing early in the match. The problem is as much as we can play Steve Black's game and point to small bundles of positivity, at some point you have to step back and accept that 0 points from all our away games, with that loss to Burton fucking Albion as the garnish, is beyond pathetic. There's a thread on /r/soccer now over how abysmal our Premier League away record is. That doesn't even count the circus that developed in the second half of last season. Maybe QPR players just get too comfortable in the tight confines of Loftus Road, and can't settle into games away?

I recall a lot of people screaming down negativity last season by appealing to our league position in the top 6. The shoe is on the other foot now. Nonetheless I have every bit of confidence that we can beat West Brom and Palace at home, and QPR probably represent excellent value for your ticket money at Loftus Road.

Anyway, on an unrelated note...[here's Adel reaffirming his wish to return to Italy in January this evening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj7_OYNpR0w). Ciao ragazzo!

Edit: Some corrections to a post composed in the wee hours with a lack fo sleep.",2014-12-15
"Good review. This was definitely an improvement on some previous away performances this season and I suspect that Harry has his eye on the next two home games, which are absolutely crucial. I doubt he'd have started Zamora on the bench otherwise - having Vargas on his own up front to hold up the ball for supporting wingers doesn't make much sense. Now isn't the best time to make an evaluation of our current form - we're at the beginning of a crucial run of fixtures. Let's take another look at the early/mid January - if we're sacrificing away points but not picking them up in the crucial home games, we've got a big problem; but if we beat West Brom and Palace at home, we can then go into the Swansea home fixture with confidence. Then it's Burnley away...

It's certainly a worry that we don't seem able to set up defensively, and I  don't expect anything from the game against Arsenal. We'll probably line up with an experimental, attacking formation, and lose 3-0. But Redknapp will be gambling on getting points from all the games around it, so let's judge ourselves on that basis.

One footnote - inevitably gossip will now turn to the transfer window. Amongst all the nonsense, what's clear is that we could do with a forward who can play alone up top. Bobby has become so important for us that we have to rest him in non-crucial fixtures (never part of the plan) and Charlie isn't at his best when he's playing the supporting striker.",2014-12-15

Z1 - prep yourself to cheer Barton when he takes corners to counterbalance the abuse from the away fans. If you're lucky you'll get a superb view of a goal there. Hopefully it will be for QPR.,2014-12-10

"Another option would be to acquire a good right-winger to allow Vargas to play up front, when needed. That is Vargas' natural position. 


I would put serious money on Vargas scoring more goals than Keane. Vargas is well settled into the club and has scored when played up front for QPR and scores plenty of goals for his national side in that position.

Another option would be to acquire a decent right-back, allowing Isla to play in his natural right-wing position, then allowing Vargas to play up-front.... that way you have two quality young players, who have a natural pairing playing in their naturally strongest positions - As this is a logical and natural thing to do I bet Harry will do all in his power to prevent it from happening, until he has no choice.

"Great write up.

I hope we'll get a point against Everton, if only because we've done well there in the recent past (1). Based on our current form, we should beat West Brom (3).

I don't expect us to get anything at Arsenal (0). Crystal Palace may be a tough game for us, but we must win it and that should push us to a win (3).

I'm reasonably confident we can take all 6 points against Palace and WBA - I think we'll lose our first game in a while at HQ against goddamn Swansea, who will be a bogey team for a least a little while longer. However sitting on 20 points when 2015 chimes in should put us in the prime spot to be control our own destiny and not have to pray that other results fall in our favour to stay out of the bottom three. If you're doing that, then realistically your top flight credentials are somewhat called into question, I feel.

Having Leicester cut adrift - which I agree is fully possible - will be a nice little stocking filler. I'm a bit surprised their fans are calling for Pearson's head though - with the Premier League cash boost I think they could do very well indeed in the Championship next season under him.

You need an excellent defensive midfielder to sit behind him., to clear up his errors. Some games he'll single-handedly loose the game for you, others he'll be the difference.

This is not an option in the Premier League.

In Milan Taarabt had a few celebrities around him, which appealed to his ego. So he played a few good games.

Taarabt has the emotional maturity of a young teenage boy. Warnock may be able to get a few games out of him, the cost is the effect he may have on your dressing room. Your call.

Again, you got a good game for this - the biggest teams to visit us this season, Liverpool and Man City, have brought the dullest fans. Leicester have been knocking around the second tier for long enough that they are used to sparring with a different class of supporter.

>Sorry for delay in responding - Would have posted earlier but couldn't get mobile access from the UK so had to wait until I got home.
It was fantastic - everything worked out perfectly: flight landed early, got to hotel and then out to Loftus Road with plenty of time to get a pint at the Springbok. Got into our seats in time to see warmups and make a few pregame obscene gestures to the Leicester fans sitting 30 or 40 feet away.

>And we really enjoyed the game - thought it was a bit sloppy all around, but exciting nonetheless. The rhythm of the scoring - Leicester going up, then QPR matching, and on - made for a great up-and-down ride and lots of good chanting back and forth.

",2014-12-03
"For 2 reasons, I hope we are about to see a gradual improvement in our position in the table:

* Our form has actually improved greatly in the past 7 games.

* So far all our away games have been against top-half teams, meaning we will soon start playing bottom-half teams, giving us a more realistic opportunity of getting results.

I expect/hope to see us slowly eke our way out of relegation.",2014-12-03
"I think we'l lose our next few away games, then some good business might give us a boost in the January window. If they don't sort out the lack of attacking options I'm gonna go get a voodoo doll of Harry. They should also buy Simpson back - he would be perfect for these turtle shell away performances.

Take 7 points from our next three home games and I'll be a very happy bunny indeed.

I'd rather look at the relegation dogfight by surveying the rivals for the drop though. I think Leicester and Burnley are most likely to drop, but then you have to take your pick from Palace, West Brom, Hull and Sunderland. That being the case, I think the results from the coming games against Palace and West Brom are vital. Thank god they both lost (at home) last night.

I think these are the away games they really need to approach with an expectation of points:

Burnley v QPR (A)|Sat 10 Jan

Stoke v QPR (A)|Sat 31 Jan

Sunderland v QPR (A)|Tue 10 Feb

West Brom v QPR (A)|Sat 4 Apr

Leicester v QPR (A)|Sun 24 May

Take seven from these and keep the home form going...maybe we'll be ok. However keep in mind that win over Leicester wasn't exactly a masterclass in steamrolling the opposition.",2014-12-03
"I think we are gonna need more than 6 away points to avoid sinking. Since we want to excuse the 7 away losses on being against the top 10, look at it from this angle. We are 0-1-1 at home against teams in the top 10 thus far. 3-2-2 overall. We have been beat by teams in the bottom 10 at home and we are yet to prove we can beat a top 10 team at the home.

"I don't anticipate calm nerves any time soon. Saturday was really stressful to be honest. I'm glad they took the three points though, as it will lessen the burden of getting a result tomorrow (although if we get thumped like Swansea have done to us before a few times in recent years...that's a different matter).

That said, we have to break this tradition of losing away at some point, and we can't leave it too late in the day. We need to be far more willing to enter into a firefight rather than invite pressure against the likes of Swansea. For the most part I think the squad largely lack the finesse to operate entirely effectively on the counter - it's a real ballache because you'd imagine that Traoré, Phillips and Hoilett are perfect for that, but I think each of them is technically unreliable for either holding it up at the end of a run,waiting for the others to scramble into play, or for finding that one touch shot to find the back of the net. That being the case we will need to scheme our way up the field or failing that use blunt force - Henry, Barton and Fer (centrally, for god's sake) swapping in Mutch should be capable of this.

As much as I think all of the home games between now and new year are winnable, it wouldn't surprise me to see us drop them. The only team we have beaten 'comfortably' is Aston Villa, Austin has scored as many goals as their entire team so far. I'm not sure we will experience many instances of us battering a team into second place this year. I think Caulker is a rock, but I have pretty grounded expectations of the rest of the cast at the back (including Dunne, regardless of his supreme efforts so far).

It's a very nice twist of fate that we're being served up so many six pointers in such a short space of time though. By the time we're heading to the Emirates on boxing day the club could be pulling away quite nicely from the bottom three. Once the confidence levels are up, and they loan in Defoe and whoever else to boost the squad, who knows what could happen?",2014-12-01
"I no longer feel nervous about how we will perform. It's 55/45 in favour of us staying up this season. If we go down, it's not a disaster; we have good practice of relegation and the club is in better shape than in 2012/13, and in fact in the best shape for the past 20 years.

As the team continues to settle, I expect to see an on-going improvement in performances. If that prediction turns out to be true, we'll stay up, with a solid base to slowly build on.

So long as I can go to Loftus road and enjoy watching our football, win or lose, I'll be happy.

---------------------------

In terms of the next game: With Dunne back in the squad we should expect to see an improved defensive performance. Our last game showed we have options for attack. The players should go into the game feeling cautiously confident that if they put in the effort they can get a result.",2014-12-01
"I think we fielded our best squad all season against Leicester.  We look miles ahead of the team that conceded eight against Tottenham and Manchester United.  Compare those games to our run against Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City and we looked much more up for the fight.  I think we could win both of our upcoming games against Swansea and Burnley.

The hinge for us is the coming together of the many players we signed in the summer.  They are coming together now and I think our future looks bright.",2014-12-01
"While I am happy we won, I'm not going to be delusional. We got one score from an own goal and the other two during goal mouth scrambles and confusion. 
  ",2014-12-01
"Hope Dunne plays as well against Bony today as he did against Costa. I think the physicality of the matchup will suit him much better than the Aguero show a few weeks ago. It seems as though the team is beginning to realize that scraping wins at home is not going to be enough and I feel the team mentality changing.

 The away mindset has got to be that this is the premier league and on any given weekend we can take points from anybody. 

I think Zamora will help us to have a little possession in the final third but I expect us to be defending for most of the night. 

Good result would be 1-1 but I can easily see 3-1 Swansea

In regards to Burnley, West Brom, and Crystal Palace. Lets fuckin win all three and ride into January a little less tense",2014-12-01
I am revising my commentary. It was an exciting game and the effort was there. Glad when going down 0-1 so early the team didn't pack it in. However it did seem like the passing was unnecessarily sloppy at times and our defense looked jank on the Leicester counter. Still very happy we nabbed 3 points.,2014-11-29
I love Charlie Austin. That is all.,2014-11-29
"What a fucking game!

Couldn't trust Onuoha all game. To be fair to him he's just come back and needs a few games to really slot in at the back but I thought we'd be fine without Dunne today. This game showed just how much we missed him. Breakdowns in communication at the back were responsible for a lot of Leicesters chances. To be fair to them they played really well and were always a danger.

Green had a decent game, it's strange feeling so confident with him in goal and seeing him so confident at the back. Caulker was the better of the two CBs but again, a more clinical team would have punished us for those mistakes. Isla was great again for me.

Really impressed with Krancjar and Fer. We played the game with so much intensity that we were always taking a risk with the result but it feels so good to have chalked up another 3 points. Let's hope the boys go to Swansea with some confidence! We can take something from there!",2014-11-29
[deleted],2014-11-29
"Massive, massive win. Hopefully we can kick on from here and string some results together.

The positives: We won. Great to see us score goals and cause problems without BZ. Fer played well - he looks much more comfortable playing centrally rather than wide. Good to see Onuoha get a start at CB. 

The negatives: We look to hit Charlie/Leroy far too much with long balls. Our midfield seem largely to be there to fight for second balls. Defence still looks fragile but fragile and quick rather than fragile and slow. The injury to Yun.",2014-11-29
"Good solid game.  Excellent 3 points, so closed to the 4-2 line I predicted.

Nice to see Fer get a goal, should really help boost his confidence.  Also nice to see Mutch get back on the pitch.

Most importantly, nice to be tied on points for 17th :D

Best form we've been in all season to boot. 2 wins, 2 losses and a draw.",2014-11-29
"Weird atmosphere for the first 20 minutes or so, but ended up very entertaining. Nervous as hell clinging on to the lead at the end.

Too much bickering between players early on in the match for my liking.

I had four Leicester fans sitting next to me. One was dopey enough to momentarily jump up and cheer when they equalised for 2-2. Silly boy. Some of the old guard marched on him, spat on him and the Leicester quartet were slung out for their troubles, missing the goal that robbed them of all three points.

Not cool at all about Yun though, that looked painful. Traoré doesn't convince me as cover.",2014-11-29
"With Dunne suspended, our defence was always likely to be shaky. There's now a consistency to our players, they need a few games to settle in. Barton is an example of this, with some poor passing and regular off-target shots into row Z. Fortunately we were able to score more than we let in.

For me, it wasn't a pleasant game to watch. QPR fans were very quiet, I think we expected to beat Leicester. There was a feeling that after recent performances, we were due 3 points, so it wasn't until late in the game that the crowd got going. When we looked in danger of not winning our players came back concentrated and ruthless, quickly scoring. When that happens I ask myself why we don't do that all the way through the game.

With all due respect to Leicester, they looked like a good quality Championship side, with little individual skill, relying on the counter-attack and our very poor defence; but they are a team we have to beat to stand a chance of staying in this league.

Excellent energy levels from QPR players and great to see a very attacking team, not something we've been used to for many years - 37 shots yesterday (6 on target) - and that was without BZ.

Traoré: Not someone we see play very often. He's another player that needs games. Sitting in X block I had a close view of his performance. His ability to put in a cross is quite amazing. He puts in crosses crosses from seemingly nothing, as he's squeezed into the sideline with no space. I think his crossing ability should be used more often.

-------------------

Next up is Swansea. They've won just 2 of their last 10 games, the same as QPR, yet they sit 7th in the table.",2014-11-29

"You could go on the stadium tour before hand - just check it is on for that match day and book tickets (club website) - it's not expensive and goes for an hour or so. They start a few hours before kickoff, so you have time to get lunch and go to the club shop before everyone else arrives. They take you everywhere; changing rooms, bench, directors box and the guides are old time Rangers locals. Great experience and amazing photo opportunities. I would recommend it for all R's fans in fact or anyone visiting Loftus Road for the day. ",2014-11-20
"There's a pub pretty much right next to the stadium called the springbok. Go there, have a pint or two, chat with the fellow fans and afterwards go to the chip shop which is like 10 steps away.

"Regarding historic pubs, it's not really that sort of place (if you fancy taking in a real Dickension boozer on your trip I recommend The Old Cheshire Cheese on the Strand). The most interesting bit of living history in Shepherds Bush is QPR itself - the area itself is being rapidly gentrified, but go and get a burger or fish and chips and a pint outside the Springbok, which is in the shadow of the ground where QPR first started playing during the First World War, be there as the streets fill up and the atmosphere builds. Remember that QPR isn't really a popular destination - you'll be one of the few tourists (and you're very welcome) - so most of the people around either live there or are returning to their manor. You'll be surrounded by childhood friends reunited, generations of the same families, a real community.

"I'd be interested to see what the stat was for last season. Definitely feels like the squad knows how to set up a chance since the West Ham game. I think the chemistry between Isla and Vargas facilitates this significantly, as well as BZ and Austin of course.

Once we've built up enough footage to bait other managers into prepping their game around those particular threats, maybe we can see the rest of the squad get in on the goal action. We're still too light on scoring from midfield.",2014-11-11
"Last season's detox feels almost complete. Honestly every match so far at Loftus Road has been great for the atmosphere. The difference from last season is pretty extreme I feel - we took a bit of a verbal pummeling from some visiting supporters, but I think we'll deliver back this year and I can't wait for Leicester and Burnley to come back to W12. I think the players are feeling it too - if the volume is going to suddenly spike due to a skillful/courageous piece of play, that must spur them on.

I think the lineups are helping things too - you've got the solid professionals like Dunne, Henry and a reinvented Barton. You've got exciting players who bring a fantastic work-rate like Yun and the two Chileans. I think the fact that Caulker started every game in the PL last year counts for quite a lot in terms of matchday experience. The cherry on top is Austin - I think we could at least double our money on him now. 

There were too many faces that didn't sit too well with me last year - BAE, Morrison, Benayoun, Maiga...maybe even Doyle and LTC. I don't get the feeling this year. I don't want Rio back in the squad, and I think his salary could be much better spent elsewhere, and of course there's SWP. However other than those two I'm pretty content with the team.

I think Faurlin's injury is an extra bitter pill to swallow in light of how well Isla and Vargas are doing. I suspect he could have worked so well with those two and helped them settle in even more.",2014-11-10

"Did anyone else watch the MOTD where they said ""Yeah, it was a hand-ball and a bit offside but you've got to admire such a manoeuvre"". Then later they went on to basically point out that there was not way that the ref could have seen that Hart fucked up (with a double-tap of the ball) when taking his goal-kick, so confirming that he intimated the refree into deciding in his favour.

I am dubious on Defoe (I think it might not end up happening) because he's got insane wages and price-tag. Unless TFC want shot of him I don't think we'll be up for paying £6m and 90k wages for someone over 30.",2014-11-09
Can I say both? I'd like both. ,2014-11-09
"I don't think we will bring in Defoe.  Also don't think we will sign Vargas on a permanent deal come the January window.  The Chilean has been good, but I don't think he has proved anything really at this point.  I think the board will look to see what he can bring to the team long-term, before making any long-term decision on his being here.  Defoe, just don't think he is what we need.  Aging, smaller, doesn't really fit in with what is working up front right now.  I think Harry is going to do whatever he can to retain our playing style right now because it is working for us.  It took 7 or 8 matches to start producing consistent performances and any change in play style is going to set us back.  If we pick up a striker in the transfer window, he will have to complement our playing style, not force it to change.  We don't have time to change if we want to stay up, we only have time to improve on what is already working for us.",2014-11-09
Someone really needs to teach the QPR media guys where the | button is...,2014-11-09
"If you watched BBC's Match of the Day last night, you'd have no idea that 

- Charlie Austin won MOTM.

- Hodgson was in the crowd, presumably to see Austin.

Instead, their focus was on how amazing Aguero is. With only a minor passing comment that his 2nd goal was both off-side and a handball.

They also spent a bit of time talking about how really great Joe Hart is; with no mention of him continually kicking the ball out of play from goal kicks and other clangers.",2014-11-09

"We have, coming up, a relatively generous string of fixtures. From these games we not only *can* take points, but absolutely *must*. These games are, I think, where our season is decided. If we get enough points there, and restore ourselves to the 1:1 games:points ratio that marks the bare minimum of what you need to stay in the PL, then I think we'll go on to stay up. If not, I think we'll get relegated.

The reason I think these games are so important is not necessarily purely the points (we actually have some kind fixtures in the beginning of 2015), but rather because of momentum. There seems to be a kind of magnifying effect hovering over this club. Whatever happens, it happens for us 10x more intensely. 

When it goes bad for us, it goes *bad*. Memories of past failures, the woeful state of our club in 2012, Bosingwa-gate, desperate failed signings -- it all comes flooding back. Calls for the manager to resign. Accusations that the chairman is incompetent. Claims that the players don't care and are only in it for the paycheque. If we go into January with the club in that state, we won't recover.

However, we are currently in the opposite condition. We've played well three games now and the feeling around the team and the supporters is resurgent and positive. All of a sudden everyone believes. But if we lose to City and lose to Newcastle away -- which is, let's face it, the likely outcome -- we'll be at 12 games played with 7 points to show for it. If we don't restore ourselves to the 1:1 benchmark immediately afterwards, I fear the downwards spiral will start again. And it'll be deja vu for the rest of the season. That familiar sinking feeling all the way down to the Championship.",2014-11-03
"I think we can, but I am anticipating it going quite deep into the season before safety is assured.

We need to address the rightback issue in January and free up Isla to play on the right side of midfield, and I'll say again - we should look to replicate what is working for us by finding a 90 minute Bobby Zamora from somewhere. I'd prioritise this over Defoe or Crouch.

After the international break we have a nice, long run of games where we shouldn't be hanging back looking to bounce away attacks like pinball flippers against the likes of Chelsea and Man City. We need to look at cushioning that god awful goal difference.

I think Burnley are almost certainly going straight back down to feat on their riches in the Championship. Only having to leapfrog two teams might be a rare luxury. However I'm guessing these two are coming from the current Sunderland - Stoke group. I can't imagine us comfortably pulling away from any of them, but we'll see.

As long as they put in the same effort we've seen over the last few matches, I won't complain. Relegation will bring in its own fresh soap opera delights, with fines and court cases and half the team disappearing.",2014-11-03
"Sure we can stay up. Seems now that we have our bearings in terms of formation and chemistry. There is not one player playing for us (Apart from Adele) who hasn't been giving their all for the club. Good signs and if we can survive this season (which we will) we should being the foundations for a successful football team in the Prem. The fans have also be brilliant. If this level of support is maintained, then we should be fine. We will beat Villa, Leicester, Burnley, Brom, Stoke, Palace etc.",2014-11-03
"I don't think i'm overconfident when I say we can take points from anyone any given week. This weekend against City will be huge and I'm hoping for something special. 

As of the past 3 games we have shown the necessary character and willingness to defend that I think only teams that stay up possess. 

However, we must stay healthy and by ""we"" I mean Charlie Austin. Additionally, no ones really talking about it that much but Zamora has been huge. Nothing fancy except for hard work and amazing hold up play. He's one of the main reasons we have been able to possess in the final third in games and since he's been restored to the team Charlie has been scoring at will",2014-11-03
"If our last three performances indicate anything, it is that we can stay up.  Redknapp's managerial strategy is a season long affair and is heavily reliant on the ""coming together"" of a group of transfers from the summer.  We were all disappointed with the way we started the season but who could've expected a group of players who didn't really know each other to gel right off the bat.  Now that the chemistry is coming together and we have two good midfielders coming off of injuries, our future looks bright.  This would be the part of Redknapp's strategy where QPR starts winning matches or at least stealing a point off of stronger clubs.",2014-11-03

"The last time my voice was this ruined was after the Derby game. £57 be damned, I had an absolute ball and we really stuck it to the Chelsea fans. Who didn't sing the entire game, btw, and [even their manager is giving them shit for it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29867892). When they scored the 2-1 goal they didn't even have the decency to mock us back. Arrogant, uninvolved 'fans'. 

Well, file this one under ""games we deserved more from"", right alongside Hull and Liverpool. If it had been *any* other team in the league, we'd have got a point or better from that game. There's been a lot of talk about whether it was a penalty or not, but I'm going to say that I think it was, if only because I'd like to continue to believe that David Luis's foul on Heidar in *that* game was a penalty as well. 

Dunne absolutely ate Costa alive the entire game, and Caulker looks far more confident at his side. Yun looked good, as always, but Isla gave the ball away cheaply a few times too many. Nevertheless that's the back-four we should persist with. In central midfield we were, unsurprisingly, second best, with Henry looking particularly out of his depth. We really could've benefited from having Barton that game. He's not afraid of a strong tackle and we could've used his ability to find open area on the pitch. 

Starting Hoilett was a mistake that I think Redknapp has to take responsibility for. Hoilett is good against teams that are the same quality or worse. But his one-dimensional run-at-the-defender game was never going to work against Ivanovic. Also he didn't track back nearly enough and against top opposition that's an unforgivable sin. Again, Zamora came on and we scored 2 minutes later. Coincidence? 

But, onwards. If we play like this we will surely give City problems. The fans were immense and will carry over that energy to the next game. We may not have got any points, but if nothing else, we've taken confidence and a sense of our own ability from that game.",2014-11-01

We almost held them to a draw. If we keep performing like that and keep the players fit we'll be fine this season. 


Chelsea's 2 goals were down to chances provided by mistakes by 2 of our younger newer players (Yun and Vargas), admittedly likely due to Chelsea pressure. We will continue to improve.

Also: despite the assurances of comnentators,  none of my Arsenal or Liverpool mates thought the needless Vargas challenge was a penalty. ",2014-11-01

"Last time Taarabt was up front on his own. It was inspired, he held the ball up and drew fouls all night. It'll have to be Bobby performing that role, and since Charlie is undroppable their partnership will have to work really well. In order for that to happen, we need to be playing a high line, because if our defence is clearing the ball from deep and Bobby is fighting for the ball on the half-way line only to lay it off to Charlie around the centre circle, it's not much use. Really we want Bobby fighting for it on the edge of the box, where he can tee Charlie up to finish. But that's tricky if they've got Costa up front looking to get round the back of Richard Dunne. It'll be far easier if they've got Drogba up front. Then we can play the high line and pack the space in front of the defence with Henry, Fer and Sandro, and just chase chase chase like our lives depend on it. When we win it back, straight to Bobby, to Charlie, to goal. Then, when we're defending a 1-0 lead and they throw on Costa, we remove Bobby/Charlie and put hoilett on, then drop deeper. At that stage the hold up man will be playing in the centre circle, but that's fine if he has Vargas and Hoilett running off him.

On Saturday we'll need a brilliant performance from our central midfield - Sandro and Henry will need to step their game up from last weekend. ",2014-10-29
"After the last two performances, I can't wait. We'll be tucked away in [the corner in the left](http://www.footballgroundguide.com/chelsea/shed-end-stamford-bridge.jpg).

Apparently Zamora and John Terry are fishing buddies. Being mates, that might give Bobby the nonchalance to really get stuck into physical battles, leaving the noble Englishmen Austin and Cahill to duel it out themselves.

The midfield worries me a little bit here. They can throw so much at us, and we will need absolutely robotic performances from whoever starts from Henry, Barton and Sandro to neutralise them. Not sure where this leaves our distribution to be honest, other than Barton's long balls.

I wouldn't mind seeing a solid bus parking strategy here. A 5 man back line? Variation of the 3-5-2, with the wingbacks playing very conservatively?

Harry must have a proper selection headache on this one. Some of our best performers from the last two games are going to have to settle for bench roles. Maybe play it defensively for the first 70, and if we're hanging on, play a wildcard pace player who might nick something?

Vargas, Hoilett and Yun being on the pitch might draw them into fouls. Those dead ball situations might bag us a sneaky goal.

So if I was dicking around on Football Manager, I'd go with a backline of Dunne in between Caulker and Onuoha, with Yun and Isla as fullbacks. A four man midfield, Sandro and Barton in the middle with Vargas and Hoilett on the wings. Austin as the lone striker - with instructions to not drop too deep and wait on breaks from the wings. I love that he is willing to drop back to put in a defensive shift, but maybe for this one he should gamble with focusing on trying to nick a goal.

We've sold out the away section, and it will probably be more useful if the energy is directed towards positive feedback for the players rather than bollocks at the Chelsea crowd, Terry and Remy. Unless it all goes 4-0 again. In which case you make your own entertainment, eh?

If it does slip into a lost cause, maybe it'd be a good time to throw Taarabt into the mix.",2014-10-29

"Good result but important not to get ahead of ourselves. For most of the game we were second best. It's easy to view the game with rose-tinted glasses because of the last 20 minutes but in the first half we had pretty much one good chance, which we thankfully scored. Once we got the 2-0 we went on cruise control, but more because AV seemed to give up than anything else.

Fer, Sandro and Henry were class against Liverpool. Really bossed the midfield. At least in the first half. In the second, we subbed off Onuoha due to injury and changed to 4-4-2. That was when Liverpool started taking over. For some reason this team doesn't seem to be very good at 4-4-2. I think we saw that today as well. Fer, Sandro and Henry could hardly complete a 10 yard pass in the first half. And Fer does *not* belong on the left. Kept drifting inwards towards the centre of midfield and left acres of space behind him which AV exploited again and again. Another reason we were lucky today because a better team would've made us pay for that. However, once we brought Hoilett on and went 4-5-1, and let Fer play through the middle, suddenly we were bossing. In other words, we need to persist with the 3-5-2 experiment as soon as Onuoha comes back.

MOTM for me was Yun Suk Young. How long has he been in our squad without starting again? Today he was full of energy, had great workrate, great positioning, great intelligence. If he keeps this up he'll begin to rival Onuoha for my favourite QPR player.

I also want to point out that this game was like the inverse of how QPR games so far this season have tended to play out. Usually our midfield is pretty good but our defence leaks a goal or two; our strikers are inefficient, waste a few chances and we end up losing 1-0 or 2-1 or something. But today, in spite of misplaced passes in midfield, our attack was clinical and our defence was watertight. That's good enough against Villa but if we're going to get anything against Chelsea and City we'll need everything working.",2014-10-27
"The Liverpool game had lots of positives for QPR, the Villa game had even more.

We're seeing a very attacking team developing. With an increasingly settled back four we could have a satisfactory season.

Highlights:

* **Vargas:** A classy player. As he settles into the team he'll keep improving.

* **Isla:** Big improvement from his early games. Great sliding tackles and excellent commitment.

* **Zamora:** For 2 games now, he's dominated the opposition box and looked supremely confident.

* **Austin:** Just as some pundits were writing him off. Excellent finishes.

* **Dunne:** He keeps it simple and was very reliable today, providing an excellent clearance service.

* **Green:** Great double save. Good communication with the back line.

* **Suk-Young:** I love seeing him do well. Non-stop commitment, excellent attitude and a great investment for the future of QPR.

"Credit where it's due, the Vargas right midfield idea seemed a bit weird before kick-off. After Vargas' two goals last week the thought must have crossed Redknapp's mind to drop Charlie and play Vargas up front with Bobby - a classic Harry little-n-large. But he got it spot on, as evidenced by Vargas setting up Charlie's 2nd.

He also got the Hoilett substitution exactly right. At a time when we couldn't keep control of the ball and Henry and Sandro weren't having enough influence in the middle, I didn't know if putting on a winger who often wastes the ball was a wise move. But as soon as he came on he provided a great outlet, made us much wider, and nearly scored himself.

Hats off Harry!",2014-10-27
"Not to take away anything from a great win, but i thought we looked a little weak offensively in the midfield.  Fer, Sandro, and Henry are great athletes and defenders, but we lacked some creativity there.  Because the plan was to lump the ball forward to Zamora (which I loved) we didnt need them to do much offensively, but I did think we struggled to go through the midfield when we tried to.  Maybe Barton will help that?

"Exhausted.

Yun - pleased he seems to be the real deal.

Austin - goalscorer, definitely benefits from  having a partner in Zamora, who I still maintain we need to replace with a younger model good for 90 minutes as soon a viable one is identified.

Vargas - pace and effort. Looks to be the type of threat we've been starved of for ages.

Isla - finally looking settled and combines well with Vargas.

Sandro and Henry - happy with these two. Karl Henry continues to be an honest pro.

Fer - for me, better in the middle.

Dunne - outshining Ferdinand already. So reliable in the air.

Hoilett - still provides one of the most exciting outlets late in games, when a player finds those long diagonal cross-pitch passes that he runs onto.

I don't understand this. Everyone knows that this is not the time to be adding fitness. I wish I had more faith in Harry because he deserves our faith.

">“I have no intention of walking away, not a chance. I’ve not even considered it.""

Well that's not a surprise, Harold. You're on a pretty penny at QPR and being an active Premier League manager breathes life into other facets of your life in the public eye.

>I’ve seen it all before. But my commitment to the job hasn’t changed and I believe when everyone is fit results will start to turn.

Even if you are committed to the job - and I'll point to your comments about retirement and golf - what do you understand the job to be, especially beyond throwing out 11 men every weekend and ringing around your old agent mates each transfer window? I'll reference the point made on the last podcast - Pulis at the end of last season stalking the club's facilities, pointing out which minutiae he wanted changed. If Redknapp is doing the same, I'm Modibo Maiga's pizza delivery guy.

>“If it’s not [Newcastle manager] Alan Pardew with one game to save his job, it’s me. Perhaps people don’t have anything better to write about.

Well...Pardew has a long contract that will be expensive to buy out. And QPR supporters are generally pretty invested in terms of time and money in supporting the club. I'm sure they could write about better things on the forums and Twitter (""What's your favourite KFC Krushem?"") but the online reaction isn't exactly whimsical tip-tapping on the keyboard on a Sunday afternoon.

>When we went to Ireland on a pre-season tour we only had 12 outfield players.

12 players? Hmmmmm.

> I get fed up some days having to drive from home at 5am in the morning and getting criticised but I enjoy football too much to think about walking away.

His enjoyment of 'football' would probably be better served as a full-time pundit.

>“I had no interest in signing one either. I said to Tony Fernandes that if we stay in the Premier League then let’s sit down and have a discussion....I wouldn’t have any interest managing in the Championship""

Again with his conditions. Some might interpret this as him only staying if he swerves failure. Others...that he will only bother waking up at 5am to drive up if it's to a Premier League club.

"Redknapp survives, then.

Fernandes should be the most furious of all. It's his funding, and the funding of people he's responsible to on some level. His little rant fails to address the insanity of selling Simpson and spending money on a beefy midfield and Isla to set up a system we ditched almost immediately.

Adel also looked pretty handy when he came on, albeit for a Zamora-style time limited appearance due to physical limitations. If I'm the man with the money, I'd be asking why one of our obviously sharpest assets isn't being used, and why more isn't being done to ready it for deployment.

I look forward to plan Q being rolled out against Liverpool. Maybe Richard Dunne can make a reappearance? Sub Hoilett out at 25 mins for SWP? Matty Phillips as a rightback?

I might as well insert an extra irritation at the general management of he club - why have half of the youngsters who already have 1st team experience of a lower level not been sent out on loan yet? Harriman, Sutherland, Andrade etc etc. ",2014-10-06

Its the same old response. ""Players unfit, Poor Pre-Season, Remy leaving last minute"". We have the players, we have the money, we don't have the determination or a solid starting 11. The more we mention Pulis, the more i like him. We have a better squad on paper than Palace, and if Pulis has the ability to blend and gel with the team, then we have a really good opportunity to survive. 

Harry won't leave. Rio won't be out of the squad. We will not have a final starting 11 with a final formation. That is just how the season is going to pan out because realistically i don't see Harry leaving.",2014-10-05
"+harryout.

We've got a tough run of fixtures coming up so have to accept that it's likely we'll be bottom at Xmas whoever is in charge. If Redknapp is still in at the helm he'll get Defoe in January, plus one or two others - if there's one thing he's good at it's bringing in players. So if we don't replace him now we're realistically talking about either sacking him in about March time and hoping for a miracle, or sticking with him as we did last time and hoping he can get us back up again.

Clearly the preferable option is to act immediately, at the beginning of this 2 week break, and install Pulis. No team should be relying on January transfers, in my opinion, and our squad, despite obvious weaknesses, is strong enough to survive.",2014-10-05

"To be honest for me it isn't early days. Fair enough there has been a lot of coming and going since the last relegation but the last time I felt positive about Harry was in the wake of the Onyewu signing (who we ended up never using). I thought he was building an interesting squad within a budget set by our owners.

Then from that first loss at Burnley onwards it just looked like it wasn't coming together. We could defend well enough, but the squad looked clueless going on the attack. Our post-xmas form was mediocre, and if it wasn't for the points from that 10 game undefeated streak I don't think we would've even made top 6. Every game he wheeled out a different squad. The ponderous passing around the box never ended. BAE kept his spot long after he should've been benched. Endless injuries raised questions about fitness.

The playoffs are a lottery and our number came up.

A summer later and boom - new cast, same shit. Higher level means we won't get away with it like last season. No instinct, no intensity, shoddy and inconsistent tactics. We've ground out two acceptable performances so far (Hull and Sunderland). Lucky against Stoke. Why the fuck did he sell Simpson? Why was he willing to let go of Traoré, leaving us with Hill as the only LB (as he clearly doesn't like the crunch on Yun's biscuits)? Why did he spend millions building for a 3-5-2, only to drop it a few games into the season? The players don't like it? You're their fucking boss. Make them like it.

In the three windows with us he's found a few of his old boys to bring in, and if still here in January expect more. I don't deny that a lot of players seem to enjoy life under his regime. However I suspect this might be because he simply doesn't hassle them. Everyone loves a boss who isn't always hassling you. Trouble is - sometimes employees need a fire lit under their backside.",2014-10-05
"I said give it 10 games into the season before the start, but with Chelsea, Man City and Liverpool coming up it's highly unlikely that we will be out of the bottom 3 after that period.

To me it seems a combination of poor starts, disinterested players and manager. I know if you come up, you can't expect to be top half after this time, but it's the way we are losing that seems so familiar to 2 years ago.

If I were cynical, I would get Harry out and try and get Pulis, but I can't see that happening with Fernandes' backing. Harry needs to have a fully formed plan going into games rather than the 11 players who seemed to do alright last week and the players need to start showing they want to be there.

I think we're missing players like Barton and carrying players like Ferdinand. I just hope our good record against top clubs from the year we stayed up gives us a boost. Until then, I think we need to give a good account of ourselves in these 3 big games otherwise I can see history repeating itself.

It looks like we might have another long season on our hands.",2014-10-05

I wasn't expecting us to be amazing, but I was expecting us to win most of these first few games. 

The main problem now is TF won't get rid of Harry until it's too late, he made the mistake with Warnock when in hindsight he probably should have held fire. If he gets rid of 'arry now he'll go full circle.

"> He scrapped the 3-5-2 which now sees wing-backs Armand Traore and Mauricio Isla struggle against a direct winger, yet reverting back would see no place for Junior Hoilett who came on to great effect Saturday.

I think our fullbacks and wingers situation is a bit comical really. Pulling out of the plan to use wingbacks has left us playing polo on a pogo stick. I thought we had finally settled the matter of Traoré's identity last season. Here we are six game in wheeling him out as a fullback again. Selling Simpson just looks idiotic - I can only imagine there was some kind of financial logic behind the move. Probably to free up funds for one of Redknapp's schemes to bring in another old boy (Diarra? Defoe? Crouch?). On the positive side, at least Traoré and Isla try, in spite of any technical weaknesses.

If we were still playing with the three in the middle I could live with Ferdinand, but all his wily experience and knowledge just isn't compensating his physical limitations in my eyes and this partnership with Caulker just doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. To be honest I'm not sure Onuoha would suddenly transform us into a concrete wall at the back, but at least he's been here a while, would presumably stick around given playing time and is liked by the people who cheer him on on matchday.

It looked like instinct kicked in, and our boys looked like a solid team--possessing the ball well, creating chances, etc.  I think the reason we can't start like that, or play nice football all the time has to be redknapps fault. When you have such an obviously talented squad like we do, it kind of has to be the managers fault if we don't gel and play attractively and consistently",2014-09-28

* Think that amazing goal from Charlie will give him a boost such a shame about the Pelle goal 2 minuets later
* Are we to become the man utd retiring home? Where players like Park and Ferdinand they come here to play shit, get talked about how amazing a player they are and just pick up a few final pay packets
* Kranjcar was great again very, positive from him and he looked like if we scored he would be involved in some way
* Green had a very strong 1st half and also rushed out when he realised Ferdinand had fucked up again

I think there are a lot of positives, obviously missing somebody like Barton on the pitch to control the team a bit more and get them going, if we could 
Play like we did in the 2nd half all games it will be a lot more enjoyable to watch and not going they have scored more goals than us we better sit back and defend this one and not attack

"I agree with all of that. One thing that worried me yesterday was that we don't how a lot of outstanding individual quality that will win us games. They desparately need to function as a team unit, with instinct and confidence in where their teammates are and what their options are at any given point of play.  There is also a chronic lack of crossing the ball. It's becoming absolutely infuriating.

Karl Henry was a positive for me. His wife's family is QPR so maybe that motivates him a little more.

I was also grateful they bagged their first goal from open play, and what a goal it was.

Kranjcar, Austin and Traoré are at least regular characters that we can be cheering now. Still undecided on Fer. Isla needs to improve.",2014-09-28

Unlikely though - 0-0 results won't get them very far. If I had the patience for a long bet, I'd feel pretty secure in putting money on them going down.

2 decent blokes. I've a lot of time for both of them.,2014-09-20
"Just home from the game. 

Defensive concerns. We have to introduce some competition in defence because something looks off between Rio and Caulker. A lot of goals have come from Rio's bad marking -- why not give Onuoha the chance to shake things up a bit? Isla, too, looked a concern today, with both goals coming from his side. 

Ref. Didn't get a proper view nor the benefit of a replay but it definitely looked like Crouch climbed on Rio for their first goal. Ref also let them get away with an unbelievable amount of dirty play in the box. Not to mention the amount of timewasting that he didn't seem to mind in the slightest. Which brings me to the next point.

Stoke. What a bunch of pricks. Dirtiest team I've seen at Loftus Road. Two substitutions used just on injuries. Don't even need to mention the corner defences or the shirt pulling either. Something is seriously wrong with the rules when Shawcross, from behind, can clatter straight into Kranjcar on the turn, and get the same penalty as Fer did when he tried telling Shawcross what's what. 

Goalscoring. Would've loved a goal from open play today: all three goals off set pieces is not a good sign. I gotta say it, Austin sort of looks out of his depth. His first touch is heavy and he loses the ball or doesn't distribute it properly too often. He deserves time to adjust to the Prem but it's not been an auspicious start I don't think. Pleased with Vargas's off-the-ball movement though.

",2014-09-20
"I thought Phillips was shocking for the most part. He seemed to settle down a bit at the end, but his first touch when receiving a ball coming with any kind of power is woeful. I would've thought Hoilett would've been a wiser choice to compliment the Vargas and Austin partnership. The man can't cross, but when you're playing next to a poacher and a pace merchant his scrappy balls would've sufficed.

The midfield was like a gang of strangers for chunks of the first half. Misplaced passes and seemingly little instinct and confidence in moving the ball into dangerous positions.

I'll forgive Traoré most things as I like his attitude and his workrate is great. He is flawed though, and he gets mugged down his flank. I anticipate a lot of facepalm moments with him over the coming months.

""Let them play"" seems to be the plan. I can't discern any solid tactical strategy any more. It seems to me that the one thing we have in abundance is pace, and we could use more long balls. Too many spells of passing the ball around the box and never finding a decent moment to bank a nice shot. A bit of deja vu from last season, to be honest.

I think St. Charles Austin is a square peg in a round hole. He isn't a battering ram, he isn't a hold-up man, and he isn't a footwork wizard. To me he is a grafter...and I'm not sure he is suitable as the tip of the spear at this level. I'm still not sure what to make of Vargas, but I think I think he is still suffering from lack of matchtime with the rest of the squad.

Two questionably fit players had to be subbed off. I really wish they would take a look at why we keep getting so many soft tissue injuries.

I think Onuoha and Yun are getting screwed over by Redknapp.

Kranjcar hands down man of the match. Superb stuff from him - he just needs to keep it consistent. One of his passes came flying towards my corner of the ground and time almost slowed down as I gazed upon the beautiful spin that characterised the perfect weighting. Still would have been nice to have Taarabt on the bench to cover for him in an emergency though. Hope he recovers soon.

Also have to mention my appreciation of Karl Henry. Non nonsense player, gets on with the job, a clockwork defensive midfielder.

If I was Stoke I would be cursing the string of fouls at the end that gifted us that beautiful goal. With a bit of restraint they could've taken all three points. They had some nasty looking characters among their support. I haven't heard such focus and passion aimed at Sombrero Man before. Then the same characters surprised me by generously applauding the tiger cubs at halftime.

I also didn't see a lot of vitriol aimed at Hughes. There was one bout of ""Stand up, if you hate Mark Hughes"" and two rounds of booing when he got up from his area, but other than that...very little from my end of SAR.",2014-09-20

"Kranjkar,  Barton and Fer put in shifts today. I hope Barton doesn't have a serious injury.

In the second half there were periods when QPR players looked clueless.  Our passing is often poor and many of of players have problems receiving the ball. 

Traore had a poor game. I still prefer him at left back over Hill though. 

Onuoha needs to be on the pitch. Ferdinand and Caulker aren't good enough.  Our defence had little movement and we're easily beaten. Ferdinand has done nothing to convince me it was a good idea to sign him. 

Also: I spoke to [Dr Alice Roberts](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/67593000/jpg/_67593787_dralicerobertsbbc.jpg) on the train.  She's beautiful.",2014-09-20
"I agree, poor form by Isla.  Does Onuoha play RB?  If so, I would comfortably slot him in ahead of Isla.  I would much rather that than replacing Ferdinand for Onuoha.  I think, ideally, our best formation is Traore, Ferdinand, Caulker and Onuoha at the back.  It will be interesting to see how Traore handles a top class right wing player.  His attacking qualities and pace are enough for him to remain in the starting XI however I think his style of play was more suited to the 3-5-2.  What do we do on the left wing?  Does Traore come all the way up, or do we play a left midfielder who slots into that attacking left wing role?

In the midfield, I think we stick with five.  Hoilett, Kranjcar, Barton, Fer and Phillips.  Kranjcar is dangerous, we saw that against Stoke and I think we will continue to see that, his fitness alone speaks to his resolve this season.  I don't think we need to justify why Barton deserves a spot, so onto Fer.  This could've really been Mutch or Sandro but I went with Fer because he's been in the starting XI and has looked good.  Phillips makes an appearance on the right wing and I think his pace, size, strength and crossing ability warrant it.  Ultimately he brings width to the team and we need that.  On the left, I put in Hoilett and that is the only area in midfield I wasn't sure about.  Who do we have who provides good width on the left wing, and can deliver a quality cross?  I think Hoilett is the guy, he is nimble and sneaky as well.  The problem is that Traore also overlaps in this role, being someone who likes to come forward and attack.  If Traore is more suited to being our guy on the left wing than maybe we switch out Hoilett for Mutch or someone who is better suited at covering left back when Traore goes forward.

Up front I think we stick with one.  Austin to start and Vargas to sub, but we have to be careful with our strikers as they are in short supply.  I was a tad worried to see both Vargas and Austin on the pitch against Stoke today because if one goes down, we severely hurt our chances going forward.  It is no surprise we are light at striker and for that reason I think we can only afford to stick one up front.",2014-09-20

what's the league?,2014-09-17
"Hahahah I love these reports, even though they are s often filled to the rim with doom and gloom.

>Despite conceding 70% of the possession, and spending the entire afternoon defending, Rangers didn’t pick up a single yellow card.

That's actually quite an infuriating stat.

>The QPR manager bemoaned the fitness of his players afterwards, and continues to lament a poor pre-season spent playing second-rate teams in Germany and Ireland, as if somebody else at the club is in charge of arranging things like pre-season and fitness training. If the pre-season is poor and the players aren’t fit, whose fault is that exactly if not Harry Redknapp’s? Does Mr Bun the Baker book our pre-season friendlies? 

Mr Bun the Baker is probably too busy rustling up goodies for Adel.

>The point of shelling out money - £45 a ticket for this one – to watch Harry Redknapp’s QPR side play away games decreases with each trip. Rangers have played 15 away games since Boxing Day and of those they’ve lost nine and failed to score a goal in 11.

Our inability to score away is surely linked to our general inability to score anyway. Still, if your travelling hardcore are so regularly let down, it's no wonder such a large contingent of anti-Redknapp supporters has developed.",2014-09-16

"As well as Chris Mendes being the son of the Cargiant MD, podcast host David Fraser works for (founded?) Frank PR, which handles Cargiant's PR activities.

[Cargiant's revenues a few years back were ~£320m, with a profit of ~£2.5m.](http://www.cityam.com/article/car-giant-drives-red-sees-more-models-leave-showrooms) Contrast that to QPR's accounts, and then factor in the 700 locals that Cargiant employs. 

This is interesting news for the club, and I'll be interested to see how they respond. Using QPR to fight this battle appears a little pointless to me - they'd need a serious deployment of resources from ArcelorMittal the and the wider Malaysian investment group. Even then, a compulsory purchase order on a company the size of Cargiant is unrealistic, and you're lining up a 'foreign money trumping locals' narrative that I'm not sure the GLA will want any part of.

I think the redevelopment will end up happening at a pace that our owners cannot dream of pulling off and will look like the outlet mall, hotel and Brent council building at Wembley. Colourful and plastic. Fernandes might want to try and sweet talk them into allocating QPR a spot somewhere.",2014-09-16
"Fundamentally I think we were outspent here. The positives for me were Traoré going forward (still always dodgy on defensive duties though) and Vargas I thought looked ok.

Having slept on it, the midfield choices seem odd to me, with us never having started Niko, Sandro and Fer before. As happy as I am to see Niko back, I don't think he should just drop into the starting 11. What was wrong with Mutch? I think he would've been a better choice for defensive work.

Also starting Hill is a bit of a piss-take. If this was honestly part of their gameplan as a plan b to the wingbacks, ie putting out a fullback with some bite, they should have put focus on bringing in someone new.

Other than that, meh. The next few games will be far more important for our survival, methinks. This game was actually pretty boring from a QPR perspective. I'm glad I didn't go.",2014-09-15
"Phillips was a big letdown for me, he missed 1 clear cut chance and was just not strong on the ball in general. Hill is a lad but too slow and old. Ferdinand didn't really go near the ball and was partially responsible for giving their strikers too much space. Kranjar looks a bit shaky, was out of position a few times Mutch or Barton would have been better.

Just got to pick ourselves up from a game we arn't expected to win and go ion to beat the other lower table teams.",2014-09-15
"Have to say I disagree with you about Greeno. The only goal I felt he should've done better with was the third, he shouldn't be beaten at his near post by that. If it wasn't for the lucky first goal reasonably early on it may have been very different, I thought it let them settle and if we'd been able to keep them out until half time they might've got frustrated and panicked. Maybe putting 10 men behind the ball was the wrong approach on the day, but I can't see what taking a more attacking approach would have achieved other than making us more vulnerable at the back. Hopefully Sandro's injury isn't too serious, he will be a very important player for us. ",2014-09-15

"I think we'll win it. We've had the whole duration of the international break to get our players more familiar with each other. That helps a ton when bringing in new faces and I also think that will hurt United since many of their players are internationals and won't have a lot of time to gel before kickoff. They made quite a number of signings and it may take a couple of games for them to settle in.

With that being said, I'm not confident in my win prediction. As you all know, we are prone to terrible games on the road like at Tottenham. If United persevere with their 3 man back line, I think we can get a 1-0 win with Phillips as the scorer.",2014-09-10
"Pretty impossible to tell, I think, until we see how this Man U squad comes together. We can all cross our fingers and hope that cash spend != squad harmony, but equally they might produce enough individual brilliance to overcome us.

For me the main concern would be the left back position being exploited by Di Maria. However I think we should have enough pace to throw at Shaw and Rafael on the break. They surely have to come at us, they need to go for a win. Two punishing goals off of counters, then we could sit back and try to hold on.

I dunno. I'll say 2-2. No expectation of coming away with anything in any case.

The plan is Traore and Isla getting forward from full back, stretching their midfield 3. We then hit them hard and fast through the middle, exploiting the space created with 4 from Hoillett/Mutch/Fer/Phillips/Vargas/Austin.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

He doesn't want to stay with us now that he's had a taste of Milan. Until that attitude changes and he's ready to give 100% to the team in training and during games, I don't think he should play.

The one thing I don't understand is how no one has been able to convince him that if he wants his move to Milan, all he has to do is work hard here and show that whatever risk Milan take will be worth it. Even if he has the ulterior motive of trying to convince Milan to buy him, if he tries I'll welcome him back with open arms.

Negatives are, some of his shots (that I saw) last season were so far off target they almost hit the corner flag. He also gave the ball away cheaply once or twice and you can't do that in the PL.",2014-09-02

Overall I like the look of the squad, with the two obvious shortfalls of a back up striker for Austin and Vargas and a true rightback.

I'm still a little baffled as to why we sold Simpson, and why Redknapp said last night that they accepted an offer for Traoré.

While I'm a little pissed off that they didn't source a striker, I am glad they told Borini and whoever else where to stick it. Unless Tony & Co spend the January window swigging from bottles of Jack Daniels, I can't see our spending plunging us embarrassingly into the red this season.",2014-09-02

Not sure about this one to be honest. IIRC he got 3 goals and 3 assists from 31 appearances last season which is in all honesty a poor return from an attacking midfielder. We would have been better off doing everything we could to get Borini or A.N. Other in my opinion. ,2014-09-01

Surprised at the suggestions he'll be bumped behind Yun in the pecking order. All that I've seen so far has indicated Yun is last on Redknapp's list.

"> in the last 2 years, there isn't much Harry did to impress me.

That sums up some of the perspective that QPR fans take, and in reality all fans. Harry has been brilliant in my books. Any manager that can take a team straight back up, especially given our circumstances come the end of last year is a fantastic manager. Sure now that we are here in the Prem our standards have risen, but to finish 17th as we all should want requires some losses. I know that our last game wasn't inspirational by any means, but it is a hurdle that we will need to get over and build from. From that game we shouldn't be expecting Dunne to play over Onuoha, shouldn't necessarily see new faces until they are comfortable and we shouldn't concede with such ease. All of which should have been learnt in the past game, although i would have rather it been sought out before the season. The fans will always be negative and bipolar, thats just the way fans are, and they are subject to peer pressure. I would keep away from forums, especially those with ""fans"".",2014-08-27

"I'm not Harry's biggest fan, by any stretch of the imagination. However, our worst enemy in the past will be our biggest danger in the future (no, not Chelsea) - instability. His tactics are bloody useless but the players are good and we only need minor adjustments to become a mid-table team. If we tear up our plans, as we routinely did once or twice a season throughout the noughties, we'll only end up going backwards.",2014-08-26

"I expect that if we lose the next 2 games, Harry will be out.

Fernandez will be thinking he left it too long with Hughes last time.

Harry has opted for a 3-5-2 system,at least partly due to criticism of toothless football last season. Problem is the change has come at a time of an influx of new players and a season back in the top league. In retrospect that is too much too soon.

In my opinion our signings have been very good. So we have a decent squad that needs sparking into life.",2014-08-26
"Late to this party as I was abroad and haven't even seen highlights of the Spurs game yet. However I'll still put on my optimist's hat and point to some good impressions I got from the first half of the Hull match. Plus I don't think we can realistically have expected to ride through the season without taking a drubbing or two of this magnitude. I'm no Harry fan but jettisoning him now would just be a tad trigger happy I think.

Last night Jason Roberts referenced us talking about the 3-5-2 on the radio in the aftermath of the Man U defeat - he said that we looked a bit clueless in the first half and the players didn't look like they knew the system well enough? Any truth? What annoys me about this is that - fair enough we've got a new bunch of guys in - we were playing with wingbacks as far back as Charlton away back in February. It's not as if this is some mystery intergalactic doctrine dropped onto QPR by a spaceship landing at Harlington. Hopefully Hoddle is still just getting started.

One thing I will say - apparently he waved to the Spurs fans when prompted by their chanting, even when we were significantly down? I hope the same people that threw hissy fits as if Mbia's Marseille tweet was a notarised statement of intent, or Cesar had taken up moonlighting as the Chelsea reserve GK in that scum shirt and fuzzy wig, were just as vocal at that. To my mind that represents a far greater show of disrespect.",2014-08-26

The Crown and Sceptre is a traditional sort of pub and my favourite on matchday (demographic is over 30s), if you're after something a bit more lively stay nearer to Shepherd's Bush. There's the Wetherspoons, the Central Bar, or if you like craft beers the BrewDog pub might be preferable. ",2014-08-25
I'd hit up the Springbok before the game - it's right next door to the ground and the most immersive introduction you could get.,2014-08-25
"Rightly so.  Firstly, Onuoha should be starting over Dunne.  Secondly, starting two new signings (Isla, Fer) against a top seven side like Tottenham, was probably not the best way to introduce them to the squad.",2014-08-25
"Just heading back now. Basically welcome to the premier league ! I think you can pretty much expect to lose when you are playing against spurs at home (their first home game) under a manager. I thought we were average but they were great. We are bringing in two new players to the side and Remy is clearly not match fit. A lot of people getting on his back ... He had absolutely no service and Austin was injured last thing. On these sorts of games you need luck because Tottenham is a £150m squad. They will be pushing for champions league this season. We are just the first to go under the knife. If any team in the bottom half of the league had come up against spurs they would have got smashed. If anybody is expecting points of the top 6 clubs you might as well give up supporting QPR right now and save yourself some heartache. We need luck and mistakes to make an impact against teams like spurs and that isn't going to happen on the first home game with a new manager. 

It don't feel it is like it was 2/3 years ago, I think we are going to do our struggling now to sort it out for the second half of the season. Look at palace and Sunderland last season the whole league had written them of just 2 months in. They were comfortably safe by the end of the season. I'm not going to say ""in Harry we trust"" but had he ever been relegated when he's had a whole season to form a squad ?",2014-08-24
"I'm surprised we have this inability to notice what is going wrong. 

Last week we conceded through a set-piece. Same thing happens this week, it's like we're not doing anything on the training ground. We gave the Spurs this game, woeful defending. And by the time we make adjustments (i.e. moving away from the 3-5-2 we're already 3-0 down and the match is basically over). 

Hopefully this lights a fire under the team or we will be in for one hell of a long season. ",2014-08-24
"A few thoughts.
1.  obviously Dunne can't play. It has to be onuaha, and redknapp is a fool if he thinks otherwise
2.  the 3-5-2 might have to go. The back 3 needs help from the wing backs, especially when Rio and dunne are in. Therefore Our midfield is overmatched because its 3 versus four or 5 opposition players. 5 in the back leaves us incapable of going forward effectively but also defending in the middle of the field
3.  fer needs time to get adjusted. Very unfair to toss him in today and expect even a decent performance.
4.  there is no life in the attack. No one wants to run at defenders or make anything happen. I think hoilett needs to play, even at the expense of Mitch, who has been sub-par. 
5.  finally however, we need to remember you can never take anything from one game. We were bad, Tottenham was good. No need for massive upheaval or panic. Nothing to do but adjust and improve. And hopefully stay up",2014-08-24

"Wasnt pretty and was very depressing, but its still early.",2014-08-24
"Worst thing about the game was our lack of pressure on the ball. We closed in on their players in ones and twos rather than as a team. I'd like to see us collectively more hungry/aggressive - as a newly promoted team should be.

Given the new faces and formation I think it's time to reserve judgement and trust Arry. If, in eight games time, we've not seen much better than today then we should be getting worked up.",2014-08-24

Mutch will play well, Fer won't be anything special, and yet again, Barton's temperament will get the better of him. However, the worst performer of the year, I predict, will be Vargas.",2014-08-22

"Travelling this weekend so will miss his debut. Bah.

Should bring some crucial balance to the wingback formation. I know we should keep expectations modest this year, but I'd really like the team to come away from WHL with 3 points, for the first notable-ish scalp this season.",2014-08-21
"There was a picture doing the rounds on Twitter last night of Vargas in Top Shop in Westfield, so barring a failed medical I think he's ours.

My biggest concern over another Redknapp transfer window was a deluge of his old players...something like Parker, Bridge and Ben Haim signings. Thank all the gods it hasn't happened like that. Age, resale value and relevance to the squad and tactics all look sensible to me, and I was still pretty encouraged by what I saw last weekend. When Isla and Fer get thrown into the mix it should only get better.

Seeing some scary odds on Remy joining Chelski this morning though. I think we have suffered in the striker market due to harsh conditions beyond our control.",2014-08-21
There's one you've missed - Glenn Hoddle. 3-5-2 is a really difficult formation to pull off and tactics are not Harry's strong point. I don't think we'd have a hope of pulling it off without a tactician like Hoddle in the backroom staff.,2014-08-21
"I agree with what you've said, however I don't think we have two quality keepers or LWBs, so I think we could look at loaning some in to plug those gaps. ",2014-08-21

"I wouldn't mind it, but can't really see a spot for him. Barton, Fer, Mutch, Phillips all better IMHO",2014-08-21
"I think he would've been useless in that game on Saturday. Mutch was the man to surge in from midfield, and I thought he done well. I can't imagine Niko could've done the same. He would have to play in the hole, so I suppose if we lose Remy and revert to playing a man behind Austin or Vargas on occasion, Niko might be a decent shout.",2014-08-21
Not convinced. 2 goals and 3 assists in 31 games last season is a very poor return for an attacking midfielder and I think he is a bit of a luxury player that we might not be able to afford to carry defensively. ,2014-08-21
"Classy player, great attitude but not the most mobile. I'd say he's a luxury sub we could probably do without.",2014-08-21
"This guy was heavily overweight for us last season, and plagued by injury.  He needs to drop the weight and become fit again if he is to be a useful member of our squad.  The fact he couldn't do that last year just indicates to me that his fire has burned out.",2014-08-21
Great news! Great player ! Has experience playing 3-5-2 from the world cup ! What a signing HARRY !!!,2014-08-20
Hopefully he'll be able to play this Saturday. Now if we add Vargas and keep Remy I think we're done. ,2014-08-20

"If it happens then all I have to say is: Welcome to the team, number 10.",2014-08-18
"Phillips is still young and a PL debutant so is probably more amenable to being used from the bench in situations when we shift out of the wingback formation for whatever reason. The guy put in a nice ball or two into the box so I'm keen to see more of him.

Simpson is a bit more of a head-scratcher; if we are planning on playing a good chunk of our games in an alternate formation with a more traditional 4 man back line, then he shouldn't want for playing time. Otherwise, the harsh reality is that he's a (perhaps unsuitable) backup for Isla, or someone you wheel out to sit on a lead. Cup games too. We saw Traoré fulfilling the role as required on Saturday, getting into those one-on-one footraces chasing balls down the wing. He has the pace to do that, Simpson usually won't. Maybe there will be a game or two where they'll know the opposition have to line up with someone slower for whatever reason, and they can give him a run-out.

I remember getting the lowdown on him from Newcastle supporters just over a year ago though, an they were all adamant he is a decent, hardworking defender but limited in attack.A year later, I don't think they were telling lies.",2014-08-18

"I loved Faurlin's determination and clear pride he has in the club. By far a player you want on your team and i don't think he needs to be replaced.

Again....Richard Dunne. The guy is a rock and i think he played well despite my preference in Onuoha. Would like to see Onuoha play against Spurs as i believe they will be a bit more pacey and suitable to Onuoha's attributes.

BZ may not be the best sub. He is quite slow on the ball, and would rather see a new striker fill his role.

Remy is class, especially in the first half. Austin was OK and didn't really look confident in that penalty kick. Would have given it to Barton, especially at that moment of the game.

The only changes that i would make is Isla for Simpson if he is as good as HR says he is. I would also swap Dunne for Onuoha. Overall i was really happy with the performance. My god were we unlucky to score at least two goals, but we have to perform on set pieces as it is becoming ridiculous. HR said that we played far better than last season in the Championship, and i couldn't agree more. Looking forward to Spurs, and ready to post the BZ ""there is no need to be upset"" picture on my Facebook to piss off my brother.

"Either Charlie and Remy can't play together, or they need to figure out who plays off the shoulder of the last man and who comes short. There was no partnership there at all. I didn't think Mutch had a brilliant game but he'll improve, plus I think we'll buy a number 10. I was concerned before the game that Faurlin and Barton and co would struggle for pace and physicality, but they did well.",2014-08-17
"Its difficult to say exactly what we need to change as we did do well but it just didn't end in a win. But here goes.

I don't think Dunne is good enough bring on Onuoha.

Hopefully Ferdinand's mistake will make him inspire him to do better as he wouldn't want to end his career as a flop.

Simpson for Isla?? Possibly, at least try it out for a few games.

Faurlin for Hoilett?? I like them both, so not sure here.

I don't like Barton taking set pieces as too many just lead to nothing.

Austin and Remy looked good but couldn't get the ball in the net, I perscribe them 10ccs of training under Hoddle.

Caulker, Mutch and Traore all were good.

Fer if we get him definitely can fill a role we don't have at the moment in central midfield.",2014-08-17
"I think as many predicted, Simpson will not work very well in that wingback role, and I thought it was risky on the whole even bothering with it at all given Isla couldn't play, although I gather that roadblock wasn't finalised until very late in the day. In contrast to Simpson I thought Traoré was fine in his position.

My other main concern is Remy - so obviously talented yesterday, but his body language worried me a bit. I hope he stays until January but I'm not counting on it. His footwork is something that Charlie and Bobby don't have. I doubt Sigthorsson has it and at this stage even with big money we won't be able to buy it in.

Elsewhere I'm not so stressed. We were unlucky to come away with nothing. 

I thought the defense were ok, even with Dunne. It was good to see Ferdinand barking out instructions to everyone looking like he meant it; any concerns over his signing should be put to bed for now, it looks like he brings a touch of that classic Man U dressing room in a way that Park couldn't.

I liked the look of Mutch, and I'm hoping he develops into something special for us. He was running around with an intensity that Kranjcar, Carroll and Ravel didn't serve up last year in my opinion. Faurlin's distribution is adequate. Maybe Barton needs to roll back his duties a bit and stick to adding bite at the back of midfield.

Question is - if Fer comes in, who would he replace from Barton, Faurlin and Mutch? I might be tempted to pull Barton to be honest.",2014-08-17
"Similar to last summer.  Harry has said Adel has not trained since returning from you lot. 

He puts on weight quickly,  so I expect he's looking like fat Ronaldo already.

Milan will only offer £3m for him. Since Tottenham will take 40% of any fee, QPR want a better price. There are rumours that other clubs are looking at him.

He's on the squad list, but has lost his #10 shirt, that is a sacred historic number at QPR, previously awarded to him as a sign of respect. 

Harry wants him to leave QPR. We need someone to buy him.",2014-08-16

I picked QPR because I liked the kits and they had Taarabt, who was a rated really well (I think a 76) and young. I ended up youtubing Taarabt to see if he was any good and his highlights were nice.

They shared a similar name and color scheme to my favorite sports team (NY Rangers, a hockey team), and my friend said they played a tough style, like the Rangers of New York, so I figured why not? Played as them, ended up beating my friend (I think he took it easy on me), and from that point, I decided QPR was my club.

This is a very good thing.,2014-08-12
"Hard to make a final call until we have more answers at the end of the transfer window...but I'll play the doom-monger of the sub: bottom three. I have real concern that some of that form from the tail end of last season will carry forward. On the new formation, I worry that Redknapp is a ""let them play"" type manager and Jordan and Bond are ineffective disciplinarians. This being the case, I think that we'll struggle to implement it very effectively. I think we will rack up quite a lot of draws thanks to the defensive additions, but not enough to counterbalance the lack of 3 pointers come next May. The issues around being ineffective up front have been in place for a year, and for whatever reason (unlucky loans, harsh market) they haven't been resolved.

I also still think Remy will go, possibly at a criminally inconvenient moment.

In this worst case scenario, all I ask for is that our season is alive until almost the end, and we're not relegated with 4 or 5 games left of the season.

You never know though. Hoddle might come in and revolutionise our game. Remy might stay and bag 15 before Xmas, relieving pressure on Austin who bags another 5 himself. We might frustrate opposition attackers to the point that we get a special feature piece on Rio, Onuoha and Caulker on Football Focus in late November.",2014-08-11
"I think that we should do relatively well for a team that just got promoted. i don't think that we will be building any momentum until a fair few weeks in. 

We have pace down the back with a probable formation of Traore - Caulker - Rio - Onuoha - Isla/Simpson. All of these players quality enough to suffice.

Midfield will be weaker with Barton, Faurlin and Mutch. This is where i would like to see players like Diame, Fer or De Guzman slotting in. If we can sign either one of these three as well as pen a one-year deal for Collison, i do see enough skill to seal a **14-16th** place finish, of which i would be more than happy.

Our forward line on the other hand is a bit sketchy. Remy and Austin are class and could possibly be the best pairing i have seen for a while in my short QPR following, but we need more strikers. Bobby Z has been performing quite well IMO. He has made a real influence in the last 20-30 minutes of our past games, and should be a good sub even in the prem. I still think we should have got Stevie May, who signed for Sheff Wednesday, but i think if we signed another striker on the lines of a Deeney (but not a his price) we should be fine.

Overall, **14-16th**.

We lack cover, and it leaves our wingers in interesting positions, as they'll have to sit pretty deep at times (although they did so during last season in some fixtures). 

We will also need consistency in selections as we try to get used to the system, we can't have the shuffling we had last year, as I think Stax hinted at that too.

Eating wise not sure as burger king or a sandwich from Sainsburys suits me, but drinking wise I go to the Queen Adelide near the ground, its QPR fans only near the time of the game, good selection of drink.

Not too early, 30 mins before kick off is plenty early.

I probably wont be there but I will definitely be watching. Have fun.",2014-07-29
"Some of this is under the assumption that you are QPR fan and not a Sunderland one.

1. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy tickets online and either print them or get them sent to you because Lotfus road is a small ground and the tickets can sell out quick. (plus you will avoid the queuing)
2. You have the whole of the food court in Westfields (shopping centre) if you fancy some food. Alternatively there are quiet a few places to eat on the highstreet and gastro pubs.
3. If the kick off is 3pm get there for 2pm if you want to breath in the atmosphere abit. The players warm up and you can get a handshake from Jude the Cat if you are lucky. If you turn up SUPER early you can see the players entering the ground sometimes.

Etiquette wise. Don't cheer the opposition.... ever. For the game they are your mortal enemies to be hated. Don't wear the opposition colours. Don't block peoples view if you want to take pictures. Feel free to talk to people if you want.

You will hear swearing, probably some of the most colourful swearing you have ever heard... directed towards the pitch so be prepared. If you get talking to someone don't be afraid of your lack of knowledge, just don't pretend to know stuff about the club you don't or else you'll end up looking like a tit.

Lotfus Road is one of the few old old school stadiums left in the bigger leagues. You will be surprised how close you are to the players. I say enjoy it because it's near the end of it's life now.

P.S if you call the club before you go you can get them to read out your name and a bit of info at half-time. Like ""Luke from USA town has made this big trip to come see QPR for the first time""... Then you might get a cheer if we are doing well in the game.Check out the shop if you feel like it after the game.",2014-07-29
"The food in the ground is incredibly shit, I'd almost recommend trying the cheese and onion slice with burned plastic melted into the pastry just to say you've survived it. The White Horse on Uxbridge Road has the best atmosphere of the pubs between Shepherd's Bush and the ground. They won't let you in without a ticket to the game. If you're willing to go more off-road there's nicer ones, like the Adelaide. Where you sit depends on whether you prioritise atmosphere or view. I like atmosphere so would say the R block or X block, but they're in the corners of the ground. I quite like heading to my seat with only 5 minutes til kick off - that way as you head into a stadium that's packed and jumping. It's a big buzz.

"If he's effective enough I think he'd jump ship to a CL suitor in Europe in January. Either way if he stays surely he'll be playing with a little extra fire in his belly. Two strikers who will want revenge on Premier League teams that shafted them on medicals - Austin/Hull and Remy/Liverpool. I kinda like the sound of that.

Hopefully now Fernandes can get to work on trying to convince him to stay. Either way it's vital we sort it out soon - getwestlondon ran an article claiming the club are furious and that would be understandable. Given he just played for France in Brazil and has pedigree at two big clubs (Toon and OM) it surely came as a shock to them that this has fallen through, and that throws a big spanner in their budgeting...8mn presumed inbound now wiped off the board and that 65k or whatever no longer taken out of the weekly outgoings. By this stage they must have got a lot more militant at regulating spend, and in light of that those aren't trivial sums. If we've already started negotiations and offering cash elsewhere based on that money coming in, then who knows how serious the domino consequences will be? We're 19 days from kickoff so we can't be fucking around now, if Remy wants out then we're going to be sitting on our hands waiting for his agent to fondle someone's testicles in Italy or Spain or France or Russia for, what, a week? Then we will only have 12 days to make signings based on the refreshed financial situation. The fact that we are allegedly back in for Kranjcar makes me wonder if they are getting a little desperate.

It's less hassle for all involved if we try to convince him to stay for at least the first half of the season.",2014-07-28
"Would be massive for us to retain Remy, even until January.",2014-07-28
"1: i hope we cane safe with a few games remaining at the end of the season. 
However i think it will be a lot tighter and come down to the last few games!

2: rumours are Arry will be playing with with cb with wing backs 

with what i can only assume would be a back three of Rio, Caulker and Nedum Onuoha.

Danny simpson on the right and Yun Suk Young on the left.

as for the Midfield it is hard to say what our strongest 11 is with various players coming back fro injury and Adel Taarabt still Lurking around the training ground.

Striker we have Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora however with todays breaking news that Remy failing his medical at Liverpool, could the football gods be gifting us with his return?

3: this season could be big for 1- Charlie Austin, 2- Matty Philips and 3- Yun Suk Young.",2014-07-27
"1. It will probably be a struggle. Last season owed a lot to letting in very few goals prior to Xmas. With our defensive enhancements maybe we can replicate that against some of the poorer teams. 12/13 is fresh enough in the memory that we are pretty realistic with expectations.

2. Wingbacks!  Redknapp experimented with them a few times last season to dismal effect. Hopefully with a bit of pre-season preparation we will be more effective with it this time, although we don't have anyone obvious to cover the right side. Danny Simpson is a hard worker but not exactly terrifying for opposition defenses.

3. Matty Phillips, Armand Traoré and Charlie Austin I guess...although I wouldn't highlight anyone as particularly prolific. The team unit will hopefully be more than the sum of its parts...but with Redknapp's deadline day shenanigans we don't know what the final squad picture looks like.",2014-07-27
"1. This season is going to be hard, especially if Arry cannot manage to sign a few key players to fill in positions that are vacant e.g. Two striker, a back-up RB and a creative CAM. If he can pull these signings off, with players who want to play for the team, then i a very optimistic.
2. Arry has been hinting towards a 5-3-2 or purely a 5 at the back formation with supposedly Yun/Traore - Caulker - Rio - Onuoha - Simpson. The midfield would probably consist of Barton, Fer (If he signs) and a new CAM. Up front is Austin and another striker, possibly Remy given this mornings news.
3. Austin - Phillips - Traore/Yun (Both have similar potential)",2014-07-27
"1) As other posters have pointed out, it won't be a cakewalk. However, I think the players we have in the squad are more suited to the Prem than they were to the Championship. So I think anything from 20th through to maybe 13th is realistic (if the table is anything like it was last year).

2) By all accounts we will be playing a 3-5-2 with Rio as a sweeper behind Caulker and Onuoha, with two full backs, currently Danny Simpson and Yun Suk Yung. The battling midfield will consist of the ever-present Joey Barton (love or hate him, he works his ass off), supported by a combo of Matty Phillips/Armand Traore/Hoilett on the wings, backed up by SWP with Austin and another striker up front (currently we only have Zamora on the books, but he figures to be more of a back up than a regular starter). 

3) **Barton** - we struggled without him last season, he does the little things, tackles, moves forward, picks out players and isn't afraid to get stuck in. When he's feeling it everything seems to click. **Austin** - without him it felt like we would never score last season, he works hard and he has one hell of a fairy-tale/feel good story (having been a bricklayer not too long ago!). Great finisher, looking for 8-12 goals from him. **Hoilett** - a winger who has days when he seems to be utterly unplayable, but lacks consistency and seems to be made out of glass, but hoping for a few great games which could save us from the drop. ",2014-07-27
"1. I believe we will just about avoid relegation. Maybe with a week to go we will secure another season of Premiership football. That would be a successful season for us.
2. Redknapp is opting for a 3-5-2 formation, with Rio, Caulker & Dunne (or Clint) at the back. Mid-field will probably have Faurlin, Barton & possibly another signing or two. Front two would be Austin & Remy (if he stays or possibly another striker or two we might be signing like Deeney).
3. Austin; he had a great season with us and after failing the Hull medical has a lot to prove in the premier league. Barton is finally maturing as a player under the guidance of Steve Black and might have his best season ever, Caulker who will be learning from Rio and looking to get into the England team. Rio they already know about. ",2014-07-27
"mention Steve Black (QPR sports psychologist) he was just as important as any player last season to get us up. he promoted and implemented the unity and desire lacking in earlier seasons and got qpr playing as a unit. Barton has been spoken about his positive effect on the club.
if qpr are going to stay up they need to keep the unity and im glad steve black is staying for next season.

1. will be 3 or 4 points ahead of relegation at least but i think there is potential for a higher finish

2. looks like harry s playing three at the back in pre-season preparation but i see harry going back to 4 at the back if it dose not work at the start of the season 

3. look out for Austin an excellent finisher ,caulker was fantastic signing a great young defender who could be future regular international and Faurlins is a great footballer and deserves a comeback after two bad injurys (plus remy and taraabt are great players but they look like leaving) ",2014-07-27

"/u/glovemachine makes good points. For me the biggest concern is what miht have been a preview match against Everton in the FA Cup back in January. [We fielded a pretty complete team](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25531987) and got rolled over like we were Brazilian. Fair enough it was only a cup tie, but that was our one brush with Premier League opposition last season and the game still had some weight.

Another factor to consider is the adjustment to the wage budget and the sum they have in reserve to actually put towards new players. While we aren't lumbered with the salaries of the likes of Luke Young, AJ and Park, we're not exactly in a position to exchange like for like. A lot of the money that has been freed up is just working us back towards a more 'sensible' (if such a thing exists in the PL) wage bill. Throw in the fact that Remy and Taarabt's ~100k/week are still our responsibility, SWP and Cesar are surely going to mug us off continuously and Barton, Hoilett and Onuoha must all be handsomely paid too...I'm not sure we're in a position to be handing out £42k a week to the likes of Caulker willy-nilly.

Here's another scenario/monday morning office fantasy - the club ends up spending very little, brings in 2/3 players and accepts that relegation is a given, but over the next 4 years ends up being a bastion of financial common sense, even breaking even at the season's end, with youngsters getting a chance and the squad competing for promotion with modest financial doping from the parachute payments.

My final point - I remember wetting my pants last summer about how the team would score the required goals to compete when the only obvious (and at the time unsigned) marksman was Austin. I make us in exactly the same predicament right now, only a couple of feet deeper.",2014-07-14

At games QPR fans, mostly, fail to show nearly enough support for the team.

I often cringed at the flack Fernandes would get from our fans on Twitter. 
Admittedly he's made very big mistakes,  but there are times and places for that kind of thing.

I also dislike seeing our fans firing insults at fans of other clubs on social media.  It really makes us look s**t.

"Oooh, here's mine:
We overrate Charlie Austin.
That's not to say he's not vitally important to us. In fact, his importance to us (because until Zamora turned up towards the end of last season he was our only functioning striker) is part of his over-valuation. We needed him, like a needy girlfriend clings to an average bloke. On top of that, he's so clearly a down-to-earth and amiable guy that the fans get a bit misty-eyed about 'our Charlie'. He's an old-fashioned footballer, one of us, the kind of player that's been in short supply over the past decade as our squad has been stocked and restocked with foreign loanees. Even down to his name - QPR have a predominantly local fan-base and are a community club - many of us have mates called Charlie and dads who drove Austins. The way he plays is the same, nothing fancy, just an honest number 9. 

To be clear, I share many of these feelings, have sung his name week-in-week-out and missed him in the months when he was injured. He's one of my favourite players. I would love it if he took the PL by storm. But my unpopular opinion is that almost none of the admiration (or even adoration) is based on footballing reasons. Take the emotion out of it and he's a good, functional Championship striker.

Prove me wrong Charlie!",2014-07-01
"A) Although a touch crazy, Stephane Mbia was a good player and we'll miss him as we claw around for deals in the market to partner Barton covering the central defenders. Every game I've watched from Brazil, I've kept tabs on central midfielders wondering if there's someone we could use.

B) QPR crowds are woefully unrepresentative of West London demographics and, if serious about chasing growth ambitions, the club should be bending over backwards to bring in locals rather than rely on people/kids of people who once upon a time lived in West London.

Midfield PL calibre players goes like this: Barton, Hoilett, Phillips, Traore and Faurlin if he can reach his old form.  Players like O'Neil and Henry could play a part but I just don't see enough skill between the two of them.  We should look to sign a central midfield, as controlling the ball in the midfield is going to be key in the PL.  We should also look to loan a player in midfield.

PL-calibre strikers include Austin.  Doyle could play a part but this is an area where we really lack.  Spend upwards of 6mill on a big, strong striker who can score goals.

As far as the rest of the team goes, drop the old players we loaned out, get rid of the slack and start building from the core that got us into the Premiership.  The positions that need the most help are defender and striker.

"Although some other fans have suggested we go for the likes of Lampard, Ferdinand, Lescot, etc; other fans feel we should not be aiming for players at the end of their careers, as this is the strategy that got us relegated and massively in debt in the 2012/13 season.

QPR need to be thinking about the long-term, that means young hungry talent. While Tony Fernandes has spoken about recruiting from lower leagues Redknapp's renowned for his love of older PL players he's worked with before. A balance will need to be found.

With this in mind, many think that meeting the requirements of FFP could help save our club.

**Finances:**

This is important, for a QPR fan to know.

When Tony Fernandes bought his 66% share of the club in the Summer of 2011, for around £40m, QPR were in debt somewhere between £10-30m.
Accounts for the 2012/13 season reported debts of £175m, with a loss for that season of £80m.

You'll see some non-QPR fans saying QPR have a wage bill bigger than some of the top European clubs. They are referring to figures from the 2012/13 season, they are not relevant to the current squad of players. Particularly as last summer 16 players were loaned out or left QPR.

Another inaccuracy commonly stated by non-QPR fans is that some of our players were on over £100k per week. Our top paid player was/is Joey Barton on £70k per week. Aside from him, in the 2011/12 season, no QPR player was on more than £65k per week. Still a huge amount of money, but not the 100's of thousands some people keep repeating to each other.

It's sensible to guess the club is now something like £200m in debt. the key thing to remember is that this is all money loaned by the 2 main shareholders (Tony Fernandes & Lakshmi Mital). In a recent Fans forum, Fernandes stated he'd likely just give the money to the club. So failing the FFP regulations is the only danger we have right now.

**The shareholder split:**

* Tony Fernandes (represents a group of friends from Air Aisia): 66%

* Lakshmi Mital (represented by fan's favourite Amit Bhatia, you'll have seen him in the 4 year plan): 33%

* Fans (though these share certificates are likely worthless): 1%

Fernandes is a millionaire, with assets around £400m. Lakshmi Mital is a billionaire and the 8th richest person in the UK. There are interesting stories surround Bhatia/Mittals dealings at QPR with Bernie Ecclestone & Flavio Briatore (the 2 who previously owned the 66% shares). That's a whole other post in itself.

**What are the main characteristics of QPR in the past 25 years?**

**Early 90's:** QPR are one the clubs who first join the Premier league. Finishing top London club & 4th in 1993/4 season. We then sell Les Ferdinand, the next season we are relegated.

**Late 90's:** Life in the 2nd tier of English football.

**End of the 90's/early 00's:** Life in the 3rd tier of English football. 2001: Ex-QPR player Ian Holloway is our manager and saviour - a short golden era in QPR's recent history, with several players and a manager who are QPR fans and manage promotion on an annual budget of £0. Ian Holloway is later controversially sacked as a result of a board take-over by Gianni Paladini - who you saw crying in the 4 year plan. Paladini is never liked by QPR fans.

**Mid-00's:** Back in the 2nd tier of football. The club is in and out of financial receivership. Fans contribute money, collected in plastic buckets, to buy a new player, who turns out to be crap. Alleged Italian mafia involvement and 'pistol whippings' in the board room. The club is about to go into receivership.

**2007:** Flavio Briatore buys QPR for about £200k. Attempts to tun it into a ""*Boutique club*"", despite it being built next to a council housing (project) estate and there being no room for your legs when you sit down.

**2010/11:** the Neil Warnock era. Flavio Briatore steps away from the club, handing his shares to Ecclestone, due to him being suspended from F1. Amit Bhatia takes charge, appoints Warnock. Within 17 months QPR have gone from relegation fodder to Championship league winners, putting QPR back in the top league for the first time in 15 years.

**Summer 2011:** Fernandes buys the 66% stake from Ecclestone, having 10 days left of the transfer window, splurging cash like it's going out of fashion. Warnock is sacked in Jan 2012. Mark Hughes is appointed manager, QPR stay up by the skin of thier teth in that famous PL game against Man City. Mark Hughes then goes about spending many £millions. Fernandes is very very niaive and keeps signing the cheques.

**2012/13:** QPR relegated after winning just 4 games all season, amid player turmoil and severe disharmony.

**Instability:**
QPR has had 16 managers in the past 10 years, been in and out of financial receivership, had it's debt taken from £20m to £200m in 3 years and jumped in and out of 3 different leagues. The one very important thing QPR needs is stability.

"Great choice of QPR over fulham, now of all times.
Can't pretend to be an expert on Redknapp but he's known for both doing wondrous things at Tottenham (which was what we all hoped he'd do for us) and disatrous things for Portsmouth (drove them to bankruptcy IIRC, which is what the rest of the world hoped he'd do to us).

There are Financial Fair Play rules regarding how much a team can spend relative to their income, but they are fairly new and inconsistently enforced, so we'll have to wait and see. Maybe someone else can add a bit more?

Fernandes seems to be well-liked by the fans and genuinely 'in it for the long run' unlike some rich owners who see it doesn't go well and bail, leaving the club in more shit than it started. Evidence of this is plans for a new stadium appearing every now and then.

During the transfer window, we've been linked with a number of ex- and current england players, such as Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Peter Crouch. Personally, I'd be happy with Lampard since he's absolute quality and seems to be a nice enough guy not to be one of those high-wage leeches on our funds that don't contribute. I'd also take crouchy as he has prior links with the club (before we got rich) and he's a memory I have of going to QPR as a kid. Not so sure about the other two.

The core of the team is hard to determine since it changes a lot, but this season it's been Charlie Austin, Joey Barton, Rob Green in particular for me.",2014-05-30
"Glad you chose us!

Fernandes is a legend, a great guy. He is fairly hands on and really seems to love the club and get involved.

FFP is financial fair play. I don't know all the details but basically there is a limit to the amount of losses you can make (6 million ish i think for championship teams) and QPR made a big loss. I am not sure if there will be any actual problems from this but cost reduction is a key point of moving forward.

Harry's style is abit oldschool. He changes around things too much and in other things he is stuck in his ways and not flexible sometimes.

Core players this season in my opinion are: Green, Hill, Austin, Barton all solid and played most games. Also key this season were Simpson, Onuha, Dunne, Morrison, Kranchar.

We need a fair bit in transfer window, but in reality will probably end up with Rio Ferdinand and a few others. http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/26oooe/actually_good_signings_that_would_be_possible/

"Not much to add to these other excellent posts. You might spot a disparity between the club's reputation among other fans (on r/soccer, for example) and the actual experience. QPR now has wealthy owners, leading to a sharp drop in popularity. The money is a pretty new arrival, however, and football clubs have deep roots. It wasn't so long ago that we had a reputation for playing entertaining, attacking football; and for being a friendly, fun place to watch football. It's also worth mentioning that QPR has a world class charity that runs out of the club. I feel that's particularly important when increasingly clubs are being run like businesses and becoming detached from their communities.",2014-05-30
"To be honest I was disappointed - rock and roll legend that I am, I used to love getting high and watching Question Time back in the day. I went cold on it in recent years though unless they had a decent lineup. Yesterday's sounded good on paper but didn't really deliver for me. I hate it when they spend half the show on one question, but I suppose that was always on the cards in the wake of the Euro election results.

I thought Joey done ok, certainly better than some other celebrity guests they've had on...I've seen a fair few crack under the pressure over the years. Just a shame there weren't two or three more questions for him to try. They overreacted to his four ugly women analogy, but then I'd expect that from a QT audience.

The most depressing part of the evening was following along on Twitter. Some absolute knuckle-draggers among QPR supporters. It makes you wonder how much time they actually spend in West London outside matchdays.",2014-05-30

"I think that we can only view these things as positives. Fernandes and Redknapp are looking for the right type of players now, not just old players looking for their last payday. 

Rio thing is different, I hope Harry's right about him because I thought he was a liability at Man Utd last year and I fear he's been getting Anton whispering in his ear that its easy money.

With Niko your right we don't need anymore injuries.... if he can't stick it he's out. We are in the position of power now, not him.

Anyone else feel like it's different this time ? The Promotion I mean.

"We'd have to move quick for Grabban, Cardiff are already in for him. I'm good with Kane, and as I said on some other thread I think we might be well placed to look at the Icelandic guy Finnbogason, hoping that he's not a new Altidore.

Seems like Brentford fan Caulker is a popular choice. Looks like a good shout on paper.

There was a name (which has escaped me) that Barton wanted to bring in from Marseille that never happened. It might be worth exploring whatever off the shelf relationships he has that are available from there.

It will be interesting to see in what state Granero returns to us. If the last two seasons haven't reduced El Pirata to a shadow of a footballer, he might do better in this new squad. He'd certainly be playing for his future reputation. We get Diakité back as well. Christ knows what we do with him. However assuming Faurlin, Barton and Henry are the only ones whose future here is currently solid...we need that box-to-box man to replace the Mbia shaped hole. Your boy there Kim doesn't look bad, and YSY's presence might help entice him.",2014-05-28
"I've wanted Caulker ever since Cardiff showed signs of relegation, but don't forget Cardiff conceded the 2nd most goals of the league. Regardless i think he would be a good choice for 6 mill.
As for Frimpong, he was shit for Barnsley but you are right, he may show some signs of potential and i would rather him than someone who is old and a surplus to our budget.
Townsend should accept a contract. He hasn't played consistently and players such as Chadli and Lamela have been chosen over him, even though they don't show a shred of passion in comparison.
As for the championship options, all of the suggested would be fantastic. McCormack would have his valuation inflated, and i think players like Grabban and Deeney have been overlooked, so we could possibly sign them on the cheap.",2014-05-28

"Was just about to make a thread like this. Would also love to see us pick up young, hungry players either from the Championship or foreign leagues. We need players whose careers have an upwards trajectory rather than a downwards one, regardless of what their current ability is. In other words, no Lampard. I also doubt that we'll see Ravel with us next season. 

As for acquisitions .. Do you guys reckon we have a shot at landing Ross McCormack? Or how about Rhodes? He's under contract but Blackburn might be hit by FFP and that might force their hand a bit. Or how about some of the youngsters from Derby? Hughes has expressed an interest in playing at the highest level, and Thorne has been looking very good as well.

We have also been linked with [Harry Kane](http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Transfers-Balotelli-Liverpool-Harry-Kane-QPR-Man/story-21140968-detail/story.html?). This is a transfer i am far more interested in.,2014-05-25
"We need a new Mbia, and I have no idea where to even look for one. Someone who can break from deep with speed to compliment defensive duties, and all at a high level.

We might be in a position to look at that Icelandic guy Finnbogason that was attached to a few QPR rumours a while back. I actually think Kane might be worth serious consideration - a big target man that would come at a better price than Bendtner.

I'd like to be ruthless with the loanees and expiring deals. I'd take Hill and Faurlin back, tell Morrison the door is open if he wants to talk. However the reality is that we've already lost around two weeks business time, and we will have a hell of a lot of players to bring in. I just hope that anyone to whom we offer an extension will have first team alternatives on the radar.

I think now would be a good moment to jump on Reading and Wigan to pick their bones for the likes of Obita and Mcmanaman.

Will Hughes is heavily linked to Liverpool, no? Maybe we can swoop on a player like him being gobbled up by the big boys and take them on a loan.

As for Frank Lampard...[he has a bit of history with Barton.](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/06/newsstory.sport8) If he thinks he can come in an supplant the dressing room leaders that are already there in Hill (dictated the terms of his own substitution again - fucking legend!) and Joey...well he can jog along on his merry way.",2014-05-25

Even if Rio, Lamps, etc. still have the quality, I have a hard time seeing them caring very much about the club. Our 2010-11 squad had so much heart and chemistry, and we fucked it up, not by signings bad players, but by signing players who didn't care. 

Our current squad has been through a lot of changes, but once again that wonderful feeling of  togetherness has started to appear. After last time, I'm just not convinced that a Rio Ferdinand on a free transfer and high wages is what we need. Will he do a job for us, week-in, week-out?

This is with a view so as to bring Zamora on for perhaps Henry if in the last twenty minutes we're looking for a goal and then put him and Austin up front. Might start O'Neil instead of Hoilett and bring him on at the same time if we need a goal. And BAE is a tough choice, main reason I'd play him is because he wouldn't be phased by the occasion whereas playing a youngster like YSY on such a huge game could be too much for him. Going with experience over youth, although I'd leave out Dunne altogether.

"I think he's had a mixed performance at QPR. After settling in he started off very well with some great creativity  up front. He's clearly very skilled on the ball, making opportunities for himself in front of goal.  His performance has fallen away in the last 4 games or so and he's looked too much for free kicks when in fact he's just lost possession. So he's looked quite ineffective and Harry has tried starting him from the bench. It's possible to see a little petulance from him as he can get his bottom lip out if things don't go his way.
Other than that, he's a very gifted player, Harry just needs to find out how to play him.",2014-05-21
"Good, creative footwork means he will always have the opposition on alert, but I watched his body language off the ball over the course of a few matches and, while he hasn't displayed signs of being a disruptive player, I worry that he drops out of games if things haven't gone well for him - much as /u/doeboy73 already said. During a period when we were toothless up front, he came in, scored a few goals and won us points. A bit of a luxury player. I worry that he doesn't run into position with any urgency on the attack.

"What concerns me about Derby is their firepower from all over the place. We had a good few chances last night, and with more luck one or two of them might have hit the mark. I think it'd be nice if we can match them blow for blow, similar to the Burnley home game. That said, who knows what effect the big game pressure will have on them? Maybe they'll be too nervous to go in all guns blazing. The same can be said for us I suppose.

If they stick with 4-5-1, the big question is who helps Barton cover the defenders? Gary O'Neil? Karl Henry? Of course you also have to say a few prayers that Joey himself maintains his cool. If ever there's a time for him not to go pop, this is it.

There's a few Derby fans that have invaded WATRB for discussion - one of them said that he doesn't have the greatest faith in the teams fullbacks. That being the case, I think Traoré and Hoilett could be useful in unlocking their flanks. I'd worry that they'd have too few targets other than Austin though...unless you abandon the lone striker gig and send on Zamora too.

I'd definitely go with Yun...as soon as he came on we immediately had an outlet down the left that neither Hill or BAE offer. I'd seen video of that tricky footwork he employs when taking on a man, but yesterday we got to see it live. If their fullbacks are indeed a weak link then presumably this works in favour of including Yun. I guess you just have to accept the buyer beware label in terms of the same expectations of his defensive play.

I'm not Redknapp's biggest fan, but I will trust him to mix the right selection and tactics for the day. I'm certainly not expecting an easy win. All I ask is that we don't get embarrassed and the players give a good account of themselves. Can't really ask for more than that.

"I think we really miss Phillips and Faurlin. I say you're spot on with the best 11 to play.

In the case of Yun, I made this comment elsewhere:

>I think there's certainly still an element of risk with Yun as we haven't got a full picture of what he can do, but I'd play him in the first 11 and would have done from a few months back. Effort and speed in one package are not available elsewhere right now. He also has big game experience - the 2012 Olympic Bronze medal match in front of 56k, against Japan with that little Dokdo Islands drama in the background. If I remember rightly the team were promised exemption from military service if they won

Of course he wasn't facing a language barrier in that game.

I thought Ravel's reaction to coming off was quite a good sign for the next one or two games...he is certainly an office temp/external consultant character, but he looks like he wants to perform, which should be good enough for us.

We should never have let Onyewu go. It's a biiiiiiig risk going into these  games knowing that one of Dunne's emergency party tricks is a professional foul to compensate for lack of pace.

"I guess this just confuses everything that much more. I haven't seen a lot of comment on his game beyond the goal other than in the West London Sport ratings.

Interestingly they comment that he worked well with Traoré - I had been wondering what a left flank with those two combined would look like. It would certainly be quicker than most of what we've been accustomed to.

The trouble is, it's a little late to continue the experiment, and the time to really get a look at him was months back when BAE started to deteriorate. Wigan will surely be fielding McManaman, and who do you trust to neutralise him? We can be pretty sure Clint and YSY will give it their all. Clint might be a good choice for the first leg when we are presumably less likely to play aggressively, but the man doesn't have youth on his side to consistently support attacking play over 90 minutes. What BAE would show up?

I think BAE will get the nod anyway. He's Harry's man. However if he fatally screws up in these games, then Redknapp will deserve all the criticism levelled at him. And if he plays Dunne and Hill over Onuoha in the middle...oh my days.",2014-05-04

I didn't see the game and don't really know how we played, when I saw the lineup I was pleased that 'Arry was fielding a good side. Apparently the penalty wasn't a penalty (may or not be true), and obviously another last-minute goal was tough to take - it wasn't another corner was it?",2014-04-26

Apart from the practical difficulties it creates, from a fan's perspective it's simply less enjoyable cheering on someone else's players. As you correctly identify, strikers will be a priority. If the past few windows is anything to go by, we'll get excited about Jordan Rhodes or Stevie May, the media will link us with Fernando Torres, and we'll end up with Harry Kane on loan. 

It's impossible to say right now, and not just because we don't know if we're going up.

**Supporter's Player of the Year:** Joey Barton. Easily our most consistent player.

Hoping for him to show the same sort of performances and the on field leadership that he has shown all season in the playoffs.

**EDS Player of the Year:** Tommy Hitchcock. Was great for the EDS Squad when he wasn't out on loan. Scored QPR's fastest ever goal in a game for the EDS squad. Scored the winner for the First Team in his only game. I think I'm not alone in saying that he deserved more chances in the First Team than the 10 mins he got.

**Goal of the Season:** Was very close between Austin vs Charlton and Ravel vs Yoevil Town, loved both those goals. But ended up going with the latter. Such a classy goal, fakes and then just slots it in the opposite top corner to the direction he is running and with power. I remember thinking at the time that it would probably be my vote for QPR Goal of the Season.",2014-04-23

"Was a pretty insipid performance from the Rs until Zamora and Hoillett came on. The difference was like night and day.

"Well, the game on Saturday against Forest where we beat them 5-2 was Carroll's best game for us so far. He made some good passes and kept our team's attack ticking.

However, he's generally been poor for us, and for me he's just not cut out for the Championship. He's very weak on the ball, short and easily tackled. When we come up against physical teams (most of the teams in the division) you almost feel sorry for him.

He might do better in the Premier League which allows for more technical players to shine rather than the Championship where physical teams will do well. Not convinced by him but technically he's not too bad.",2014-04-16
"Saturday was his best game this season. He took his first shot at goal for QPR and many of his passes went forwards.

Unfortunately, for much of the season, his performances have been poor to acceptable.  It's a shame.

He obviously has some technical ability and puts a lot into every game. He seems timid and usually easily gives away possession or instinctively passes backwards or sideways. I'm afraid to say he can be frustrating to watch and at one recent game abuse from a small section of the QPR crowd towards him got a bit out of hand.

As Ultrapleb has said, Carroll is not a Championship player, whether he's a Premier League player, I don't know.",2014-04-16

"In theory only two of the last games involve opposition chasing something - Barnsley and Millwall striving for survival. These matches might present a decent opportunity to work against teams fighting tooth and nail to stay alive, similar to the playoff scenario.

"Interesting. However I think one of the frustrating things about our dropped points this season is that, bar two or three games, we haven't been on the end of ruthless spankings. It feels more like the hunger to win was never there in the first place, as opposed to the team slumping to a string of poor results.

I will say however that Harry has been in the game for almost all his life, and has become very rich off of it - he is still the 26th best paid manager in the world. If he hasn't developed a thick skin by now I'd be a little surprised. He sticks to his guns so resolutely that I'd guess he handles the pressure pretty well. Moreover I would be shocked to learn he actually gave a toss if ASR decided they wouldn't be renewing their deal to have their brand plastered on Richard Dunne's back next year. I'd say QPR is relatively lucky in that we may not face the same headaches around those kinds of business issues as other clubs - whatever their failings at QPR, the likes of Fernandes, Beard and the Mittal clan have a decent mix of reputation, contacts and business acumen.

His rap sheet is pretty extensive for me now as well - exiled Faurlin, made Mackie leave, stacked the team with his own, failed to survive in the top flight, wasted time on trying to sign Bridge, Parker, Hooper et al., failing to sign enough firepower, glacial wingback formations, overlooking the club's own youngsters, loans loans loans, indifferent interviews, and at the end of it all the evidence appears to indicate the team won't be promoted this year either. For me that wouldn't be so bad. However Harry should be judged by measuring the clubs on-field success against the relative jangling of coins in his pocket.

If anyone is going to grab the team by the scruff of the neck and try to persuade them to pull themselves together, I'd say it's more likely to be someone within the squad.",2014-04-12
"That's a really interesting perspective. I think it helps explain a little bit about what's wrong with the team at the moment regarding their poor form. Redknapp is evidently excellent at handling the circus of a modern football club - he's a survivor. More often than not he's a winner too, but even when he fails he doesn't self-destruct. He exudes confidence, which must help hold a club together when there are cracks appearing at all levels of the infrastructure.

The downside of all that is that while those qualities are essential for a long career in football management, they've nothing to do with football. Redknapp's game management of late has gone from the bad to the ridiculous. He changes the lineup (and often the formation/style of play) every game, yet it's wrong every single time. He doesn't appear to study the opposition, often playing into their hands. One single example is the way he always seems to leave hoilett out against teams who field an organised lineup to frustrate us, even though hoilett's great strength is that he pulls players out of position - then starts him against teams against whom a short passing is the correct option (and he wastes possession and ruins patient approach play). Another is the way in which he persists with the same exhausted back line that's been shipping goals for months. 

As many fans will remember, however, QPR have had many decent football managers who haven't been able to handle the demands of the club off the pitch. Paulo Sousa springs to mind - clearly a smart guy and a decent tactician, but fell foul of the politics of the Briatore regime (when Dex was sold to forest while Sousa was on holiday, if memory serves). There are very few managers who can excel at both sides of modern management.",2014-04-12

"If you offered promotion to me, I'd take it not only for the money, but also to see what would happen. I can't envisage anything good (other than the £££), but it might be entertaining mayhem. Realistically Championship is the wiser choice - they will have to bring in quite a few players to replace those on the outbound, even if we deployed the squad above you'd still need a lot of cover for probable injuries. It will be far easier to make those acquisitions in the Championship where stupid sums of TV money aren't sending everyone a little hyperactive. This is all leaving aside whatever ball and chain FFP will/won't be securing around the club's neck.

>We're still a Championship club trying to become a Premier League club. I think we should do that one step at a time, with a plan, rather than a short-term smash and grab.

The club has big plans, and presumably the money in place to fuel those plans, but that doesn't guarantee these things will happen. In terms of more tangible assets they have simply got an ageing senior squad of playing and coaching staff, a charismatic but rickety old stadium and a training facility from which Jose Mourinho turned away in disgust upon first seeing it on a quest for a temporary replacement for Chelsea. The Championship is still a respectable league. It provides a decent level to develop a squad for a few years down the line as the board start to get to work on the other projects - as far off as the stadium would be, Warren Farm at least should be up in a few years. That can be the first step in building up some credibility for their competence.

I'm beginning to get a little wary of the power structure within the club though - I can't name a single source for inspiration within the organisation. The media team do a great job..but Fernandes has hardly been in the UK over the season, Redknapp and his people have done their thing, Beard...I dunno. Steve Gallen and co. are presumably powerless. Do we even retain full time scouts? Since Ian Butterworth left I don't know of any. I think merely hoping that there are unknown names keeping things heading in the right direction behind the scenes is wishful thinking. Amit Bhatia needs to focus on proving himself in his other business ventures - not usually possible at a football club - and so I don't think he's in a position to take any more control.

That's a pretty impressive line-up. Only Hill and Barton are not viewed as attacking players.


I've put Maiga up front as, with so many forward players behind him, even I should stand a chance of knocking one into the opposition's net. Austin should be subbed on, providing he's available.

This season I've been waiting for both Traore and Austin to be fit long enough, at the same time, so that Traore's crosses can be used by Austin. I think they've only played one or two games together so far. Given time I hope they can form a good partnership.

"I can't dispute your first 11, aside from your omission of Banayoun. Who, in his last 2 games, looked the best player on the pitch. 

For the first half of the season BAE was the best left-back in the league, but went well off the boil; quite a surprise and disappointment.
Suk-Young is 24 and so is the type of player we should be moving into the 1st 11 on a permanent basis. He's one of ours not a loan player. Warnock was anti-loan players for a good reason.

For Saturday the back four pick themselves: Suk-Young (LB), Hill (CB), Onuoha (CB), Simpson (RB).

We should see Hoillet (RW), Barton (CM), Morrison (in-the-hole), Henry (CM) and Benayoun (LW) - I think Benayoun's rise in form at QPR is a good example of how it takes players a while to settle into a club. Both I and some others have been guilty of a lack of patience with some of our players.

I don't want to see Zamora start. He's a 2nd-half sub, who can help keep the ball at the other end of the pitch and perhaps assist in creating opportunities for other strikers. With no pace, he shouldn't start a game.

It'll have to be Maiga starting up front. There are rumours Austin will play. We'll see. He should not be played if it means he'll be gone again as a result.

Keeper: Green (of course).

Subs: Zamora, Dunne, Murphy, Kranjkar, Traore, Doyle, Carrol.

Next year I'd like to see a QPR first 11 that includes Austin, Suk-Young, Hitchcock, Philips... we really have an embarrassment of riches in Midfield, that would compliment a mid-table PL team, it's difficult to really choose our best 4 midfield players. 

Also: If Traore is fit, I'd play him on the left, drop Henry to the bench and move Benayon into CM.",2014-04-03
"> It is tough to argue against Yun joining the squad

Tell that to Redknapp. I'll hold my hands up as a pessimistic clown if I'm proved wrong, but I fully expect BAE in the squad whether we play that wingback mess or with a standard back 4.

I would've said just rest a few fragile players for these last few games and wait on the playoffs, but that automatic promotion spot is still only 9 points away, and with Burnley's injuries and a run in with games against Wigan, Ipswich and Reading...it's tempting to try and get a full strength squad out there ASAP.

>Taarabt has tremendous ability, as he showed for Milan the other night. Everybody warned me he would get me the sack, but I could see goals in him and that is what we needed.

Although we lost, we ended going up in the next two or so years anyway. The other big game that comes to mind is [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-4UG1S6rQI), which was as big for us as it was for city, as we as good as needed to win to stay in the premiership (although in the end some other results went our way and we stayed in the premiership anyway).

Som players from the past that I hope someone a bit older and wiser than me can tell you about include Gerry Francis (who later became our manager for a while) Trevor Sinclair ([who scored what some people still think of as one of the greatest ever goals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcIR6ftJuk)) and David Seaman, ex-England goalkeeper with funny hair. 

Present players to look out for are (in my opinion) Niko Kranjcar, Joey Barton ([who is about as nice off the pitch as he is on it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XegUySZ7gUA)) and Charlie Austin.

Edit: I forgot to mention that at the moment, we aren't exactly the most liked club in the world.

"Thought about posting this myself this morning.

>McClaren is a modern-day technical coach, working on shapes and formations, studying tapes and Pro Zone charts. His meticulous preparation for games knocks Mark Hughes' oft-mentioned version into a cocked hat.

I sincerely hope Fernandes et al. find someone similar for the next top man. I worry that detractors who claim he is too obsessed by big names are on the mark, and we'll get someone like Sven in next.

>Gary O'Neil is a regular fall guy – removed at half time on three of his last five starts and after 54 minutes in the game before that and subbed early again here. What's that old line about the definition of insanity being repetition of the same action while expecting different results?

Wasn't a mindblowing signing over the Summer, and to be honest this deep into the season have never thought he brings too much to the party. Giving him a start on the wing over Hoilett, Traoré or even SWP just baffles me. As does the midfield as a whole. I'm not sure why he's switched it up to the 4-4-2 formation now - I think getting more familiarity with the 5 man midfield might have been worth it. As others have said, putting Carroll in the middle of a four man midfield just looks clueless.

I wonder when Onuoha is going to get his chance again? He's young and on a longer contract than Hill and Dunne. Starving him of playing time in his primary position seems a bit short sighted. We don't want another Jamie Mackie exit on our hands.

I quite enjoy the online meltdowns in the wake of these games. It drags on the match experience deep into the night.",2014-02-12
"This is hardly how I view the situation.  The loss of McClaren... How about the loss of Austin?  Even Phillips and Simpson to a smaller degree.  I saw the Derby game and witnessed an ineffectual QPR side.  Our goal scoring situation has constantly been under the gun since the beginning of the season.  Just as we were starting to build something, unfortunate circumstance wiped out our progress.  Now we have a few more strikers but none of them can replace Austin like for like.  So now we are playing two strikers to make up the difference but that changes the whole dynamic of the team.  Basically this leaves us building up chemistry from scratch and it certainly showed against a quality team like Derby.  Time, a commodity we do not have, is what it will surely take to become effective in this new system.  We need to hone our skills against some weaker teams, starting with Charlton, and hope for a run of form to develop that can carry us through to the end of the season.

It was going to be difficult even with Austin at the helm, now, it is only going to get harder, and winning promotion through the playoffs now looks a more realistic goal.",2014-02-12
"Posting this off the back of a disappointing performance this evening, so not feeling massively optimistic.

The prospect of hanging onto Kranjcar and BAE after this season previously whetted my appetite, but to be honest that is beginning to fade. Even I'm losing hope in the wisdom of having Carroll in our midfield, and I've previously praised the guy for his attitude. Jenas was a pointless signing.

I won't be sad to see the back of Harry when his contract expires or he decides to quit. I just don't buy that he gives that much of a toss about QPR/West London. I'll also throw weight behind what doeboy says - McLaren leaving was a sad loss. The club has been churning out a lot of media content this season, and it looked pretty clear he was a big part of the kick off to our campaign.

I think we will crash out in the playoffs. They need to start building a team, not a motley crew of Redknapp alumni superglued together, decorated with a few extra loan deals. The trouble is there might be serious financial consequences for not going back up.

Maybe things will look better in the morning.",2014-02-10
"**Will we go up?** I still retain hope in going up automatically simply because we generally don't drop points against teams lower down the table, and it's possible to lose to teams around you yet still get promoted this way. However I think it'll have to be via second place or not at all. Can't see us finishing outside the play-offs but can't see us going up that way.

**How is Harry doing?** Personally, I think it's harsh to blame him for performances like last night considering how a lot of us have said before the season started that not getting relegated would be an achievement. So as disappointing as it is to see such a lackluster show last night, in the grand scheme of things we're doing alright, and Harry is doing his job just fine in my book.

**Tom Carroll** I think he's very good technically, but some teams in this division are very physical and so small players like Tom will get bullied off the ball, so perhaps last night and at other times he hasn't been the best selection. Although I have watched him play against weaker teams such as Yeovil this season, where I found him to be decent on the ball.

**Niko Kranjcar** He's obviously very talented, and watching him sometimes is like watching Taarabt, although this applies when he's playing both well and badly. He's got some great goals for us this season and at times his individual flair has been very useful, however it can be infuriating to watch him arrogantly give the ball away through deliberately risky passes and swagger around the pitch when we're chasing the game.

**Jermaine Jenas** Haven't seen a lot of him this season to be honest, would say that he's a player we have enough of and don't particularly need to retain, although this obviously depends on who we lose and bring in come the summer. Decent work rate.

**Assou-Ekotto** Similar to Kranjcar in that he is very talented, yet doesn't *seem* to care much for the team, I think that's fair to say. However he has been one of our most consistent performers this season so I'm not going to slate him. The Burnley home fixture recently was poor, because the third goal especially was his fault for thinking he could physically beat the Burnley attacker, but everyone makes mistakes. The thing that made me angry with him was that when he got knocked over he looked up, saw Burnley would score and went down holding his knee instead of getting up and at least trying to win the ball back rather than pathetically trying to save face. That and the way you'd think he'd learn from his mistake yet invited the same pressure and gave away at least two identical chances from the same mentality later in the game, once in injury time. But other than that game he has been great for us.

***

Overall I think to go up it'll have to be in second place, which should not be out of our reach. It's easy to get overly-pessimistic after watching the game last night but putting things into perspective, we're doing well and still have a great chance of going up.",2014-02-10
"Disclaimer: I am a misery guts. Luckily most other people on here are far more positive...

We're like Arsenal, in that we can't get results against the top-of-the-table clubs.

I think we'll end up in the play-offs and unfortunately right now it doesn't look like we have the type of team required to fight our way out of that situation.

BAE & Kranjkar are great. We have lots of individually skilled players, what we don't have is a well-developed team. The Championship is particularly about team ethic. With the exception of Hill & Green our team has been cobbled together during this season and continues to be added to.

When McClaren went, it was just a few games before our defence started losing it's shape. We've slowly let more goals in since then. There is a popular idea that McClaren's coaching was responsible for the great results early on in our season.

Harry is great at attracting relatively big names to our club, but what we are not seeing is the formation of a QPR team.

We are usually predictable. In the first half we wait for the opposition to come to us, we often go a goal down. At half-time Harry gives everyone a bollocking, then we get a goal back for 1 point or we manage to win. That can work against poor teams but won't get you anywhere against an organised group of players.

Also: Don't get any QPR fan started on the ridiculous way we started the season with only one predictably fit striker, after letting 4 strikers leave the club in the summer.

Sorry, I warned you, I'm a whinger.",2014-02-10

"Panic buying is infuriating, no matter what the context.

Stevie May actually sounds quite interesting this [BBC article on him](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25854199) from a few days ago. This quote stands out:

> He was quiet and focused. And his work ethic meant he was the last player to leave the training ground.

However we are talking about the Scottish League. If they were reluctant to take Nahki Wells as there'd be a question mark over him for PL football...you'd imagine the same rule applies here.

In spite of what I said about him in another thread, Zamora looked semi-useful last night. Not 50000 notes a week worth, but nonetheless more effective than I've seen him in a long time. It was against a tragic Bolton team though. Nonetheless as it stands we should be able to cobble together a strike force every game from him, Austin, Johnson and one of the kids.

At this point I'm also not entirely convinced another striker is going to make a lot of difference. I'll gamble an opinion and say that - longer term - a lot more playing time together between Carroll and Kranjcar would be more valuable in creating chances. Ditto some consistency down the left wing - another player at Phillips' level down that side of the pitch would be a godsend.

If they do need someone as injury cover for Austin - and I suppose they do, as Johnson and Zamora are not the most robust/versatile of players - then Stevie May sounds about right. I'd certainly rather go that route than spunk millions into Blackburn's account. If we want Rhodes we can try and get him if/when we know PL revenues/Remy transfer £££s are coming our way.

Which match do you have in mind? Unless the bus leaves after the ticket office has opened, you'll have to by the ticket beforehand. The ticket you get is allocated a seat, but it's sit anywhere, and there were plenty of free seats on my coaches.

> Does the same bus service that takes you to the game also bring you back to London? Is this included in the fare?

You will indeed be getting the same bus back to London included in the price. This means that you go straight to the coach after the game though, so no opportunity to sight see in whatever post-industrial provincial idyll to which you're headed.

>Can passengers imbibe brewskis on this bus?

Nope, and it's apparently illegal and can land the (third party) coach company in hot water.

3. Open Proxy SwitchySharp options and configure a proxy profile for the server you picked in step 2.

> Down to the refuge, near QPR, I drive to committees in my German car

I did not actually know what QPR was (and remember, no Internet and Google for random students in those days), but I was pretty sure it was something like ""Queen's public road"" (since he was driving on it).  I finally saw QPR listed in an English football magazine that I picked up in Harvard Square and decided, immediately, that they had to be my club.

I followed the team the only way that you could back then, occasional snippets in the papers or football magazines, but it seemed to get harder and harder as the team slowly drifted down to the third-tier in 2001.  While QPR's fortunes seem to be becoming more and more dire, a funny thing happened though, the Internet really made it much more possible (and fun) to follow a team, even from a distance.  All of a sudden there were fan groups and message boards, YouTube videos, and finally Reddits.

I can only tell you that I have never been more welcome on the Internet than dealing with Rs fans around the world.  Over time I have swapped beef jerky for jerseys and scarves and received packages of programs and Rs gear from wonderful folks.

"The thing that fucked this squad was the fact that we missed out on Gary Hooper in the summer window. Harry's original plan had him and Austin forming the core of the attack which would also be able to keep us afloat in the premiership. 

Thing is, the back line (as you pointed out) is keeping us going. My preference would be to have a mean defense to rely on. Once a system is in place it keeps itself going (and also, in most other sports, it is defense, which wins you big games etc). It then enables us to 'win' ugly, and personally, if we do get points on the board, I'm happy. It doesn't make for a great final product for the fans (at times like today), but being in the top 3 is a great place, especially after the cluster fuck of last season.  

Harry (IMO) had a fundamental change in the way he thinks about football after being fired by Tottenham and when he was thinking about managing England (the whole thing about bringing in Brendan Rodgers and playing a different style).  He has switched to possession based football and packing the midfield, which seems to be the style much more on the continent than it is at home, with that emphasis on one striker rather than 2. Again, had we had Hooper, we may be playing two up front, with a packed midfield/mix of wingers with Barton and another playmaker in the middle of the park. Either way, he wants us keeping the ball rather than handing an initiative to the opposing team (in theory). So far it has panned out at times, but has seen us struggle at other moments, the Championship is much more a slug fest than the Prem, that is what we need to keep in mind. I think the plan was to implement the system this season, with an eye on it being ready for when we're promoted (and I think that the higher ups will be hedging their bets on us going up this season), but we've lacked that second striker/other winger to finish the opportunities we create (Hoilett seems to have a hamstring made of glass). 

Long story short, I think Harry is in the process of trying to implement a new system, while having to integrate a fair number of players. We've done a good job so far of shipping dead weight (though some still remains) and if TF is as keen as he appears, if we add a striker of Jelavic's caliber (hoping the fact that Kranjcar is getting time with Croatia working in our favour!) then we should be find for the rest of this season, baring some minor tweaks (such as a replacement for Carroll if he leaves). I'm still hoping for an automatic spot, as I think out defense will outlast Burnley's strikers and Derby's form as well. 

Anyway, apologies for this wall of text, it's just that I've spent a lot of time thinking about how management, to me, appears to have been trying to think one step ahead this term in terms of strategy rather than looking for quick fixes, which means that we're still in a period where the squad and system are getting used to one another. 

Again, if I'm talking utter shite, then please tell me! 

TL:DR: Striker such as Jelavic and possible replacement for Carroll and we should be good, New System and new way of thinking means this season is a growing period.

"To be competitive in the Premier League, I think the club needs a dramatic overhaul, which is hopefully already in progress. Consider Barton complaining about the club's 'lower league' mentality when he arrived, and his demands for basic improvements such as extra support for the IT guy.  Consider Hughes coming from a club with extensive scouting reports on most top player across Europe at Man City, remarking that there was practically no scouting system in place at Loftus Road. Consider Mourinho taking one look at the Harlington training ground during Chelsea's need for a replacement while their own was being redeveloped, and writing it off as unsuitable. The last three years must have gone some way to improving this...we know that the new training ground is on its way, at least. In an age where we aren't going to be wheeling out Rangers fans as players, we need to improve the infrastructure as much as possible to foster professionalism and create and attractive working environment from top to bottom. Merely throwing obscene salary packages around obviously doesn't work.

To get promotion...who knows. More goals and a few flashes of luck probably. A decent team would probably help...and to be honest I don't think we have as good a team as we could have right now.

"> It shouldn’t have escaped Redknapp’s notice that Forest’s performance was epitomised by a man he felt he had no place for in his team, Jamie Mackie.

Just when Redknapp had won me round a few weeks ago...fickle bastard that I am, freezing out the likes of Mackie, Diakité, Hitchcock et al. might have the pendulum swinging back the other way. Guys like that have their foibles and are unlikely to be the tip of the spear in pushing for a return to the top, but they would have been nice options to reach for last night. There are a lot of question marks in my head over what exactly is going on in team selection right now. For one thing, does anyone know what our best starting line-up is? Especially in midfield? As the LFW post says, what exactly was expected from a starting 11 containing out-of-form Zamora and Henry? Fair enough Redknapp is paid sacks of cash every year to know better than me, but I wanked away enough evenings as a youngster on Football Manager to believe that sometimes you click through to the kids to look at emergency options for a striker. Onuoha's treatment is a bit of a strange one too.

Mercifully no matter what division we're in next season, there will be no option but to rebuild the squad due to the scheduled contract expiration exodus. It might not be such a bad thing for the long term if that is done without Redknapp, whose presence has deprived us of what are for me more interesting possibilities like Rosler and McClaren. Not that I want Redknapp sacked, but if he walks away after a midtable Championship finish the stars might align nicely. The squad he's assembled looks like a castle built on sand right now.

"We have stickies now?! Coooooool.

Seriously though, what a game of two halves that was. I hardly recognised us in the first half. Long balls and poor possession play throughout - pretty much the opposite of what we've been all about so far in the season. 

Then on the other side of the half it didn't take long for the roles to reverse. Suddenly it was Blackpool who were hoofing the ball at every occasion, and it was left up to us to attack and pile the pressure on. The first goal was massively flukey but big props to Austin for chasing the GK and forcing the error. Second goal was sheer clinical beauty.

2-0 away at Blackpool is a huge win for us. Being able to get three points from a tough mid-December away fixture in the pouring rain in spite of a bad start is a very good sign. The sign of a winning mentality. We'll need more of it in the near future.

I also think Carroll is getting better and better. He had some really nice passes today. If the quality of his passes start to match the quality of his vision he'll be a real asset very soon. It was also great to see Onuoha back on the pitch. It's so conspicious how he and BAE are a different class than the opposition. Benny handled his flank with such ease throughout.

The Doncaster and Blackburn games were disappointing, and unfortunately we have only difficult fixtures coming up. But beginning on this run of four hard games we've got exactly the start we needed, and in getting it, we showed the pragmatism and determination that hopefully will see us take points against Leicester, Nottingham and Watford.

I remember how I thought Hoilett was gonna be the bee's knees earlier in the season.  I no longer believe that to be the case. Does he not have the confidence to weight a decent pass when he's moved the ball into the danger area? In theory having a player the standard of BAE should compensate to some degree, but that doesn't seem to be clicking yet. Christ, maybe it's time to give Traoré a run out.

Throwing on AJ sounded like it energised things slightly. Maybe the squad we have suits his playing style more than Austin?

Thankfully Kranjcar's injury can be covered, but with what level of creative quality is the question.

Still...3rd place this far into the season is pretty nice. It's just frustrating that we can't capitalise on that position buy scoring goals. 14 in 13 games isn't really what I'd expect from the millions the Club is dishing out. The next two games should also be tough. How well McClaren knows us could be tricky.

What's frustrating is that, as opposed to merely avoiding doing a Wolves, they've obviously spent the money to chase promotion, and it would be nice to feel comfortable with the table position which still has us in the frame. We had enough players to almost field a team that in theory wouldn't have been plagued by the problems of last year, that they could have grown organically. I don't mean the dross that we shippd out. I'm talking Hill and Onuoha. Harriman and YSY. Barton, Faurlin, Diakité and Phantom man. Traoré, Hoilett and SWP. AJ and...well, prob would've need another striker.

Even Austin and Phillips are here on a kind of second step of progression in the game. No-one can question the importance of rolling up your sleeves and doing a job, but for games like this, and it should have been a big one, some cliché fire and passion would come in handy.

The passing routine is frustrating if it isn't creating chances. We had 61% of the possession but only 6 shots. I think we needed someone extra running into the box to support our attacking. Hoilett is no longer inspiring confidence down the wing. I think it's time to give Phillips the chance to show he's up to his price tag, with SWP getting a shot down the other side. Harry's seeming devotion to Jenas is reminding me of Bosingwa's constant selection last year.

Can't begrudge Burnley the victory too much. They had the coach route out of town lined with people waving at us and flipping us off. The coach sopped at the worst service station I've ever been to just above Wolverhampton. All in all a pretty shitty day out. The ladies running the coach were lovely, old school west Londoners though.",2013-10-26
"Slightly off-topic but does anyone have any news on Nedum Onuaha? I remember Harry saying that the injury was ""long term"" but exactly what ""long term"" means I don't know.",2013-10-26
Really great stuff.,2013-10-25
"It sounds negative (because it is) but I'd like to see us play like Warnock would have played in this fixture - tough, defensive, quick on the break. A point for us is better than a point for them. That means putting our pretty passing game on hold and going back to three CMs (O'Neill, Barton, Henry), two wide players and a lone striker. It won't be pretty, but with Hoilett and Kranjar in the team there should be enough to threaten.",2013-10-24
"Day too early mate! Impatient for the weekend, eh? :)

I don't think any result (beyond a 5 goal drubbing either way) would surprise me with this one. I would be sorely tempted to switch up our formation to throw something unfamiliar at them. AJ and Phillips have both had stories on the offish proclaiming themselves to be fully fit, so I would be happy to see a two striker set up for the first time in a while. Give Hoillett another chance to move the ball up the pitch at speed and have the combo of AJ and Austin to work to get on the end. Close out the game with five in the middle if we need to shield a lead - which I'd judge a more legitimate tactic at Burnley than at Millwall. While our effectiveness at keeping other teams from scoring is pretty well known in the division, Burnley are second best, having conceded only 7 goals.

Edit: And for those of you who won't be making the trip to the beacon of British industry and commerce that is Burnley...I've seen messageboard and Twitter chatter suggesting the game will be available to stream.",2013-10-24
"I'm just excited that a stream might be available to watch this game.

This will be a real test for the team but I think we will come out on top.  We've got the quality, we've got the mentality.  As long as the players believe in themselves and come out fighting, we can pull off a result.

In our last six meetings with Burnley, we have drawn three times and lost three times.",2013-10-24
Night and day compared to last year. It's all building up the pressure for Saturday. I really hope we don't play for a draw.,2013-10-22
"The game is available on Ustream.

Hope this is a worthwhile exercise for all three. [Harry has also talked up Chevanton in another media blurb](http://www.westlondonsport.com/qpr/football-news-javier-chevanton-gamble-by-redknapp-74732-html), so we might finally be out of the woods for a while on the striker front. Austin, Kranjcar and AJ on the pitch together should provide a decent spread of goal scoring opportunities.

Phillips looks like he really needs to get his game up to speed. He didn't have a pre-season and dropped into our set up relatively late, so it's not fair to lament the millions he cost this early on. Subbing him into a situation where the plan was to hold onto a victory margin of one goal was perhaps not the ideal re-introduction for him on Saturday either.",2013-10-22

I think I'd still stick to my position that it'd be better to keep him for next year's Premier League campaign (if we're going up) as BZ/AJ will be even further past it then and Austin is unproven at that level. On top of that, the best place for a mercenary is at the top of the pitch in a vanity role.

Edit: As I've said elsewhere, the fixture list is pretty nice, with the majority of the other high flying teams not playing us until just before Xmas. Hopefully we'll have passed the 50% mark of the ~70 points we need to finish top 6, even with this strikeforce. However I agree, and I noted a while back that I can't see where goals are going to come from. Johnson will probably be good for a few when he plays, and he will hopefully be back reasonably soon, but I'd bet he'll rack up a maximum of 4 before he's sidelined again. I feel bad for Austin as the service has been so very, very poor. It's still early days for Phillips and Kranjcar, so maybe they can scrape a few each when they're in the rhythm of things. Fingers crossed Chevanton isn't standing on legs of fine china and has some decent goal nabbing instincts. They're wise to have only signed him until Xmas though.

As solid as they are, Hill and Dunne are no spring chickens. Chris Baird can jog on, assuming we couldn't come to a happy financial agreement with him. I hope the crowd responds appropriately when we meet Reading.

Hoilett is also still out, and haven't heard about Kranjcar. I guess the lineup will be the same that we saw against Brighton, with a possible extra striker (Hitchcock) subbed in in the second half. A concentration of 2000 QPR fans at the stadium should at least spur the team on nicely.",2013-09-20

"[Allegedly another one with Joorabchian's fingerprints on the contract](http://www.oneworldsports.com/stories/source-kio-joorabchian-involved-qpr-fall/).

I suppose we can be charitable to the guy and say that at a minimum he'll draw an opposition defender, but overall should he be playing professional football? Probably not. [This is the Zamora of yesteryear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUlJ-5t4x0E), and the guy on the field yesterday didn't look like even a shadow of him.

What annoyed me was that once subbed out, Austin was left to fill in the target man role. As I said on another thread, I'm not sure this suits the team. All the highlights of his goals over the years suggest he needs to be fed the ball directly into a goal scoring opportunity, not jumping onto the end of long balls (although any fighting for the ball is naturally appreciated). I hope Kranjcar is competent in the air, or we focus our passing to the feet.

Hitchcock's youthful pace alone might provide more opportunities than Zamora, but unless we can field AJ and Austin simultaneously, I'd stick Kranjcar, Faurlin or Carroll or whoever behind Austin.

We're a team with money to burn, first team chances over a long season up for grabs and yet we're only ever linked to Spurs/ex-Redknapp strikers.

"Was a nail-biting affair at times. Could have gone either way.

Again, the opposition had clear chances on goal, which they completely missed. Surely we would've been punished had we allowed that in the Premier league.

Zamora had a mostly poor game again, we looked much better when he was taken off.

Hill was easily beaten by pace, something opposition managers will make note of.

SWP kept good possession and often won the ball, I think he's too easily criticised by some QPR fans. He won't score many goals but is someone I like to see play for us.

QPR players were not moving into positions for interception of forward passes until the 2nd half.


It's difficult to criticise whilst we have gone unbeaten so far this season. Hopefully the new players will add some strength in possession and some very much needed fire-power. 

The QPR crowd was mostly quiet, I'm not sure why that is. Does it show a real change in expectation?",2013-09-14

Tom Carroll looks tricky with his feet but so, so small. Don't think he's suitable for a 4-4-2.

Worked out nicely for Phillips to get the game time, which I think should help him get to his optimum level. Nothing too amazing from him here though.

I wouldn't worry too much about AirAsia for the moment. They are in a very sweet business - air travel in a booming part of the world that [made a profit of $613mn last year](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/26/airasia-results-idUSL4N0BQ0Q720130226), which should leave them on solid financial bedrock for a good while yet, even if the results won't be as good this year. Their Indian operation is due to kick off as well. Fair enough, they're not as local as Cargiant, but I can think of worse corporate backing.

I wish I could get a QPR shirt without the logo on the front though.",2013-09-07

"Stick with Green. He hasn't done anything to justify dropping him so far. He can also (allegedly) communicate with his defense more effectively than Cesar. It's a position in which it's worth investing some loyalty to nurture confidence.

It'll be interesting to see if Cesar is given the bench though (if he doesn't start).",2013-09-06
"I feel it would be a great shame if Cesar were to take over, since Green and the defense seem to be gelling well, however it also seems a waste not to play a goalkeeper of Cesar's caliber.",2013-09-06

"I appreciate I know next to nothing about what happens behind doors at QPR, yet I find his claim hard to believe.",2013-09-04
">""I didn't think in any moment about leaving QPR,""

Well we can chalk that up as a lie, and not a panicked one either. The smoke around his departure rumours was the first to be visible, and I haven't even caught a glimpse of him as much as training with us in months.

Surely this guy wouldn't be made welcome among the new look squad this season? We'll probably have to loan him as I doubt there are many clubs in Europe who can afford his current wage structure. Ideally we could move him out to Brazil, where I'm lead to believe some superstars' wages are footed by private organisations for commercial rights as opposed to the clubs themselves. Possible for the Brazil team goalie in a domestic WC year.

We might have enough meat in midfield to actually muscle onto some of his hoof-it-up-the-pitch distribution this year.",2013-09-04
Well how about taking a Championship-esque pay cut?,2013-09-04
"Great review. You only really realise when you see them all at once just how many players we got rid of this window. Good business from 'Arry on deadline day, bringing in the Tottenham loanees. Honestly, with BAE, Hill, Onuoha and Simpson, I think we have a Premier League-competent defence in them. Our midfield is stacked, as you pointed out, and strengthened by the loan acquisition of Carroll. The one really big caveat is that Austin hitting form and starting to score some goals isn't a bonus or an extra or a luxury, it's a necessity. For the moment, churning out 1-0 wins with grit and fight will do, but it won't last for the whole season. 

Anyway, very nice write-up. Good read.",2013-09-04
Aren't we chipping in for Park's wages? Something about the PSV wage structure not being to accommodate paying 100%? ,2013-09-04
"Just came to say thanks OP for the great read. I'm not Henry's biggest fan but hadn't considered that he captained Wolves to promotion, so must have been doing something right. I'm really looking forward to seeing Kranjar play in hoops.",2013-09-04

"In 'Head Boy Chief'? I didn't notice - what minute is the mention in, I want to hear it!",2013-09-04
"Assuming you mean Clint Hill, then definitely him.  He brings experience and has the right spirit we need to win in the Championship.

I would expect BAE and Niko to debut on the 14th (our next game).  They are both highly experienced players who add depth and experience at their respective positions.  BAE is only 29, has almost a decade of PL and is a delightful signing (even though it is only a loan).  Niko is also 29, with 7 years PL experience.  He is capable of scoring fantastic goals and, once again, will benefit our team tremendously.

Carroll is 21, so he is fairly inexperienced.  Tottenham believe he is an excellent player for the future.  Redknapp may not start the young gun until the right matchup presents itself.  It will depend upon his form whether or not he plays on a regular basis.",2013-09-03

"Just got home. On the one hand, it's good to receive a shot of humility. On the other, that was a pretty depressing display, and an alarming indication of what injuries can do to us.  Thought it was a scandalous performance in midfield. SWP taking the ball nowhere on most possesions. Jenas playing the friendly ghost routine right until the final 10 minutes. Diakité probably a poor choice to start. Even Saint Faurlin looked terrible. Zamora is just mugging the club off for money now, should've started one of the kids.

YSY looked a lot sharper in the second half - but I am not sure what his hand was held up for prior to the cross that that prick Ranger put away? Whatever. I'd play him at LB as first choice now.

"Here are my thoughts:

1) A huge improvement on last season. This was my first game at Loftus Road this season and I was impressed by the team spirit on display. Rather than giving up after the first goal went in as was so often the case last season we kept trying to win the game for the full 90 minutes.

2) Sean Wright Phillips needs to go. He's go pace but that seems to be about it. I'm getting tired of watching him the run the ball to nowhere or getting muscled off the ball. I was down the other end, but it looked like he missed a sitter one-on-one with the keeper. 

3) Zamora needs to take a pay cut or go. I think he's a useful player to have around but squandered too many chances last night to justify his wages.  

4) No 'plan B'. When Faurlin came off Jenas looked lost and didn't know what to do. The confusion ended up leading to their second goal.

Overall, pretty optimistic about the season ahead and looking forward to seeing Barton and Henry play. 

Also, £7.50 a ticket!",2013-08-27

"If he hasn't been a mischievous lad, this is good news. We might be able to sell if we don't get promotion and he has a good season. If we do go up, we will be facing slightly less of a mission trying to score a top flight striker and avoid the ball-ache Palace have been facing.",2013-08-27

Overall a very tense game to watch, and i am stoked with 3 points.",2013-08-24
"Dunne is pretty handy with his head. Pleased with him after a few games.

It would do my nerves some good to secure games with a margin greater than one goal.

"I really really want to see O'Neil starting in place of SWP on the wing, just because he seems to be able to stay on his feet a lot better, and looks creative. 

Dunne looked solid as well in defence, and Onuoha, very nice to see us keep a clean sheet. 

I was also really happy to see Rob's reaction as the final whistle went, just booted the ball into the away stand, after all the grief they gave him, it was pretty funny to see. ",2013-08-17
"On train home from game. Would've been very unlucky not to get all 3 points this time. Zamora better than he has been, but still not good enough.",2013-08-17
"Wow, brilliant debut for Hitchcock! Delighted, but still much to be done. we'll have it rough this season without a bit more depth in the squad. Shariff was on the bench for goodness sake (although, and forgive me if i'm being overly cynical, that may be Harry's idea to force Beard and co's hand over transfers)",2013-08-17
"A great result. We had plenty of shots, but couldn't find the net. Aside from a couple of breaks through our defence, one from Dunne's (who is the size of 2 houses) poor pass-back to Green, Ipswich hardly had a shot at our goal.

Zamora had another very poor game. Again SWP was beating him to headers. The crowd got quite fed-up with Zamora's poor passing, lack of interception and general lack of effort - he looked very unfit and nervous. I've heard that some fans even started booing him; I didn't hear the booing and hope it's not true.

SWP looked to be playing well and kept winning the ball, he looked pretty amazing at some points with his effort and possession. Jnr Hoilett was great again, I hope his injury isn't serious. The back 4 looked to have improved, though that may have been due to the quality of the opposition. 

Rob Green took nasty abuse from Ipswich fans throughout the game, it got to be quite viscous after a while, because in 2007 he played for Norwich, their rival team, apparently. After his celebration at the end I can't imagine what it will be like when we visit their place.
Green made a great finger-tip save in the first half and generally looked most confident I've seen him, despite the abuse.

Joey Barton had another great game. He received standing ovations from X block and others, we chanted for him several times, including a new one...

So it sounds like all has been forgiven, which is true so long as he keeps putting in performances like those we've seen from him this season. Some of his passing over distance was pretty amazing.

Interestingly Clint Hill moved up into a wing position through a lot of the game, that could have been due to a lack of pressure from Ipswich.

All in all QPR looked a level above the opposition, the issue was the creativity, setting ourselves up for a goal. I also think that Zamora has become a waste of a position, we are starting games with 10.5 players at best, until he is subbed off, then we seem to score.

Will Harry now play some of the talented QPR youth?...... No, he won't.",2013-08-17

Hopefully it's just journalists filling pages, but the danger is Hoilett getting his head turned by the possibility of a quick jump back to the PL. He might have a good relationship with Hughes as well. This would be a kick in the teeth.",2013-08-15

"He will eventually take a pay cut and go to a one of either Italy, Spain or EPL, it's a WC year and he will be wanting to play for the best possible team he can so he can play in his last WC especially in his beloved Brazil.

"I'll try and post full impressions later, I'm on the train back to london now. In short, the tactics were a mess. We murdered them in the second half but didn't score, mainly because we weren't direct enough and both AJ and Austin looked unwilling to provide an assist. Our most exciting moments came courtesy of Hoillett exploiting broken play, which is an indicator that our possession plan was not working. Despite that, we didn't change it, or our shape, all game. There were no terrible performances, though we improved when Henry went off and Barton moved to the centre.

Johnson was outstanding, easily MoM for me.

Traore could potentially work very well with Austin, should we let him go?

Don't trust Traoré in defense. Not sure what his starting means - is he off or not? Suppose Yun will start against Exeter.

I'd feel sorry for Zamora if he wasn't earning ten of thousands a week. Harsh to judge him on one game but doesn't seem to be achieving what's being asked of him in the little-and-large routine with Johnson. Hopefully this was a one-off to give Austin time to settle and Bobby will take on an impact sub's role in the future.

Faurlin's string of tackles was fantastic, would've been beautiful if Hoilett's subsequent run had killed the game with a happy ending goal.

"It's honestly difficult to predict, like Rob Green said recently, if we assume we'll bounce back up to the Premier League then we could become the next Wolves. I'll go with a conservative estimate of mid-table, however if we nail the signing of a decent goalscorer that stays fit then perhaps a play-off spot is within our grasp.",2013-07-30
"I'm rubbish at this sort of thing. Last year I [predicted we'd finish 10th in the PL](http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/y35ty/where_will_qpr_finish_and_why/), so what do I know?

This season I predict we will finish mid-table. The reasons for this are that we have some quality players, but inevitably some of the issues with squad harmony will still exist from last season, there's also still too much churn of players in the club.

I believe Harry is setting up a squad to go straight back up, so he's got one eye on creating a squad that will play in the PL, yet we are competing in the Championship.",2013-07-30
"Let us start in net.  In my opinion you couldn't have a better keeper in the Championship than Rob Green.  Regardless of the fact he is on the wrong side of 30, his 7 years of Premiership experience will be invaluable this year.  

On defense you are looking at Clint Hill and Nedum Onuoha as the only two who have been with QPR for any length of time.  Newcomers include Danny Simpson, with three seasons of PL experience and Richard Dunne, with a staggering amount of PL experience.  I think these two could be a great asset to QPR.  Lastly we have to factor in Suk-Young Yoon, whose opportunity to shine for QPR is now.  A mainstay for the Korea U23 and U20 teams, Yoon has looked good in preseason and has the potential to make the difference for QPR this year.  We transferred out Bosingwa, Samba and Ben Haim.  In my opinion these players were all cruft and I'm glad they are gone.  Armand Traore looks to be leaving the club as well, with offers reportedly on the table for this services.

Moving to midfield I think we are doing alright.  Stephane Mbia, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Junior Hoilett, Jermaine Jenas, these are the types of players who can be prolific in the Championship.  Even though Jenas is creeping up in age, he was a regular for Tottenham and has enjoyed years of PL experience.  Then we have Granero and Samba Diakite who are excellent but appear to be on the chopping block.  It is doubtful that Taarabt would play and even if he could, I don't think his attitude is welcome at the team any longer.  We cannot forget Shaun Derry whose attitude and work ethic has been paramount to QPR's development since 2010.  He may not feature but his presence will hopefully inspire those on the pitch to step it up a level.  Karl Henry, our new signing in the midfield, had a three year stint in the PL with Wolves and seems to have the attitude that a Championship player needs for his team to prevail.  Lastly, Joey Barton is still a member of the squad and while the past few months have been tumultuous at best, he may find himself playing in the Championship with QPR this season.  His skills would be useful, but I think it depends more on his attitude and commitment to the team.

I think most people would agree when I say that a lot of our problems lie at the striker position.  Obviously, signing Gary Hooper would've been immense but that didn't happen so we all just have to forget about it.  We have Bobby Zamora and Andy Johnson, both are past 30 and injury-prone.  Even though they have both gone on record in the summer touting their renewed fitness, if one of them goes down and we are in serious trouble.  Johnson has looked sharp in pre-season and has an eye for goal, together with Zamora I think the two would do well together.  They each have significant PL experience but truly, I think we need another striker, in his 20's, who can take over the brunt of the work.  With Johnson and Zamora supporting a third striker the team would be complete in my opinion.

So, in summation, and if you read all of that, good for you and thanks.  Give us a £3-4million striker and optimistically I think we can win the league or at the least secure a playoff spot.  Redknapp is a great manager and has always had my support.  Paramount in Portsmouth's promotion and giving Tottenham their first Champions League foray, we are in good hands as far as coaching goes.",2013-07-30
"I really think there'll be a hangover from last season and I can see us hanging around mid-table to above relegation until the turn of the year. After that, I think the player quality will come in and we'll be fighting for the play-offs at the end of the year.

Also, I won't be surprised to see Harry leave by January.",2013-07-30
"Slow day at work. Some random predictions.

I'd drop a fiver on us to achieve promotion, a tenner to finish mid-table and 20 to avoid relegation.

I think the squad looks quite nice at the back, and will hopefully keep other teams at bay. I'd punt an uninformed fiver on us conceding the fewest goals in the league.

If we moor off with Zamora and Johnson - as now seems unavoidable - Johnson to be the focal point for goals until teams make more effort to blank him out. One in every two for Johnson and Zamora if we're lucky one in four. Two pound coin at the bookies on Zamora injuring his hip jumping for a ball.

If Hoilett plays well, my crystal ball suggests teams in the Premier League swoop for him in January, and even if the club doesn't want to let him go, the guy wants out.

Barton to return to the pitch in September; some wind-up merchant gets to him by pushing his buttons, possibly in a fake French accent, and he gets sent off. A pound coin on him to be the next QPR player to get a red card.

In the January window, the market favours sellers fleecing teams that need cover for injuries and we sell off some remaining dead weight. Moreover if we still have some of this money sloshing around (keeping in mind that 5 million for Hooper must be burning a hole in someone's pocket) we will also be able to go hunting, with a better understanding of team weaknesses. Ten pounds sterling on us scoring 65% of total goals for the season after January following acquisition of a fresh striker.

I say we end up knocking out one PL side out of a cup competition.

At least one player firing off some stupidity on Twitter.

If we're not in a good position come mid-season, Redknapp to walk. Mutual termination, he already has the biggest house in Sandbanks. Fiver on McLaren taking over in January.",2013-07-30

Rumours of a deal to buy out Luke Young have come to nothing. Other than that, as long as Bosingwa leaves, we might as well leave the defensive side of things alone. The three signings seem sensible and sufficient from here. If they can keep other teams from scoring, we might get away with scoring 65 goals being enough to finish in the top 7.

We have too many midfielders. So many that even if they signed Townsend tomorrow, you'd raise an eyebrow. Offload Taarabt, Granero, Mbia and Diakité and the picture should be clearer. The kick in the nuts is that those players are all in their prime, while Park, Jenas and SWP are at the end of their stories and haven't got Championship experience. While people might not have welcomed Steve Kean's warnings about the Championship, his pointing out that his stats people discovered a jump in distance travelled per game stuck out for me. It's gonna be harder on the old-timers legs. I don't trust any of them to create goals, so right now it looks like I'll be pinning hopes on Hoilett and Faurlin, possibly Traoré.

It's up front where it all looks donald the ducked. Even if they bring in Austin and he gets 25, where will the other 40-45 come from? Watford have brought in most of their goal hungry loanees from last season, and even got some Paraguayan to replace Vydra. In contrast we've got Johnson and Zamora. As you say, both are highly suspect to pull a Championship amount of games out of the bag, although they too are available to instabuy as personalised shirts for your kiddies. Can we even hope for 10 goals apiece from them? I hope Johnson does well. If Remy is with us until January, maybe he can add another 10. Then we just need to bag 15 goals from amongst everyone else. I don't think one new striker is enough. Maybe we can loan another one in.

As for the chemistry, it's hard to say without knowing where the specific faultlines lie. Amputate most of the French-speaking mob for a start to fizzle out one clique. Bumping out the overpaid would also be beneficial, but Zamora looks like he's staying and I didn't seem him earn his wages last season. Would I be stretching it to call Zamora one of the worst signings QPR made during the 2 years in the Premier League? In any case looking at contract lengths I think we might be in for a season of detox from the toxic year we just had.

I've completely forgotten Barton amongst all that. And I am not sure how the likes of Harriman and Ehmer get a look in.

He can probably command a pretty penny in promoting beer, or bank accounts, or unfamiliar snack foods back in Korea, which would partially offset the drop he'd see from the criminally high wages we must be paying him.

"Looking at the table from the last couple of seasons, we need around 70 goals if the team wants to be in with a chance. I'd say we're pretty far off that right now. We could re-sign Campbell, or somehow cough up wages for Crouch, but neither is a spring chicken. The idea of signing the Dwight Gayle kid from Peterborough was probably the right thinking. We might be able to use London as an incentive to bring in a decent striker on loan from a top flight club up north. It's time for Redknapp to put his market savvy into action. I think the owners would be unwise to throw too much money around before the training ground and new stadium are live projects.",2013-06-20

A few of them are middies but majority is u-21 offshore attacking talents.  Anyone want to help me widdle this list down?

Depends on which direction Redknapp wants to take really.  To be honest I don't think you can build a Premier League team on veterans.  You have to pick up some talented youngsters that can continue to develop as players right through a Premier League campaign.  Sure, it is a risk but I think Redknapp knows talent when he sees it.  A few years in the Premier League, these players are worth much more and you really have the base to build a real contender in the top flight.

Now that would take some doing!",2013-06-19
"I've been wondering about this too but I haven't found an answer. [This  Loft For Words' article](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/fb_news.php?storyid=32156) that /u/doeboy73 posted yesterday speculates better than anything else I've seen:

> Rangers are seemingly now restricted to taking a vastly reduced offer from a chancer or – yet again – loaning out a senior player with a view to a permanent move further down the tracks. Remy meanwhile is limited to said loan spell, starting World Cup year in the Championship, or hoping that the charges come to nothing in time for him to catch the tail end of the extended transfer windows in the refuse skips of European football – Russia and Turkey.

As attractive as the idea of Rémy starting the season at QPR is (assuming he's innocent), he is on a substantial weekly wage that I think the club realistically needs shot of for financial reasons. They probably need the transfer fee on the balance sheet as well. That said, I imagine they will be left with one or two high earners come September; if he was one of them (again, assuming he's innocent) I wouldn't complain. We'd still need to address the issues up front when he left in January though. Having an ace up your sleeve for only half a season won't be enough.

Maybe we could work out some kind of loan deal as specified above that includes a future purchase and bundles in a year long inbound loan of a decent young striker.

"As far as I know, QPR haven't sold one single player this summer. 10 players have had contracts expire and they seem to have been low-salary deals, so will help a little, but are not enough to achieve financial fair play.

I expect this summer clubs will leave buying from QPR until late, they know we HAVE to sell the high earners, that don't have relegation deals. Though they seem to be the players Warnock acquired (Ferdinand, SWP, Young, Barton, Traore).

I would like to think Rémy has a relegation clause, I'd *really* like to think that.

An option is to send Rémy out on loan to a PL club, if not to save some money, it will be to keep him in the shop window; he is a player we likely have to sell if the opportunity arises as he is potentially valuable, we spent a lot of money on him (and Samba) and we can't afford to see Remy's value drop.",2013-06-18

We can offload a lot of the poison and Redknapp will hopefully make some wiser hires than Hughes did, given his greater experience with management.

Agree 100% that they need to shake up the striker situation. All too often Zamora looked in discomfort after a spell of play in which he was involved came to an end, and god knows what's become of Andy Johnson after his injury. Definitely want Campbell to stay. What about Bothroyd? He scored a good number of goals for Cardiff at this level, but I'd rather they went out and brought in someone younger. All of the above are the other side of 30. Is Balanta worth bringing into the rotation yet?

I was speaking to a Forest supporting mate last week and he was adamant that Leicester are going to spend and be very dangerous next season. Watford will presumably have access to the same resources they had this year. There are some great games to look forward to.",2013-06-02

"Good stuff matey, all props to you. I'm another convert from this season - at least you have the excuse of having been separated from W12 by an ocean up until this year.

I grew up in a far flung part of West London without a truly local team. While it may be traditional to inherit your team from your elders, this never really happened with me. My grandfather was a Mackem but died when I was 5 months old. My mother told me the stories of him dressing the TV in a Sunderland scarf in '73 for their cup win, but he wasn't around to pass along any passion for the team, who in any case would be a nightmare to support from down here. My mother herself grew up further inside West London than me and used to go to Chelsea games in the '70s, but as a single working mother she didn't have any time to ~~corrupt~~ bestow me with much sentiment for them, although I was impressed when they fielded an entire squad of foreign players in the late '90s. I vaguely recall a handful of QPR supporters in primary school, but they were vastly outnumbered by the usual suspects. A mate took me to a Watford game (David James almost knocked me over in his car afterwards) but I don't come away feeling like a connection has been made. In secondary school it was pure Liverpool (immigrants from the 70s who'd fallen in love with them and passed it to their kids), Man U (bedazzled youngsters), Arsenal and Spurs (local-ish teams). I maintained a respectful interest in the primary goings-on from afar, picked Leyton Orient in CM/FM, and and plodded on as an agnostic.

Fast forward a fair few years. My Actonite other half would occasionally tell me about QPR people with whom she'd come into contact through work. She would complain about Steve Gallen being a moody bastard (although I don't trust her judgement on this). My daily routine took me on the Central Line through White City/Shepherd's Bush most days. Every once in a while I would get caught in a train full of fans going home from White City. Come the 2010/11 season, my girlfriend complains that riding herbike home down the Uxbridge Road on promotion confirmation day is a nightmare as there are drunken fans everywhere going crazy. Around this time I'd started looking for a flat locally and it clicks - I'm actually going to live close to a team. It stings a bit that it's a fresh top flight team, as no-one wants to be labelled a bandwaggoner, but after years of being the only footballing orphan among my peers the lure was too great. I started following the team from afar from then on. I ended up living in Acton in 2012 and as soon as finances were stable, I pulled the trigger and went to Loftus Road.

It hurts and shames me, as a born and raised West Londoner, that I've missed out on this for so long. I still feel like something of a fraud sitting among the QPR faithful - I haven't invested anywhere near as much time, energy and emotion (and £) in the team as they have and even if I live to 80 I probably never will. All those years before silly money kicked in were lost to me. I've bounced around SA Road and Ellerslie Road stands for matches, and had one in the Paddock - I bought my ST for next season centrally in Ellerslie Road as I feel like I'll tread on fewer long-term fans' toes there. Historically, I have nothing to compare the top flight to. I even feel like a clown posting here - but I guess everyone has to start somewhere. On a last minute plan I took my Liverpool supporting mate and his dad to Anfield on Sunday, which was my first away game. I shouldn't have been inviting the enemy among us, but it got me the ride I needed and neither him nor his dad had ever actually been. I still haven't checked up on how he felt sitting among his West London peers supporting a team from the other end of the country. Getting to applaud the guys who came over to us after the match was a fantastic end to my first chapter as a supporter. August can't come soon enough.

So there you have it /u/KeeperEUSC, Fernandes might lose the Koreans he was hoping to bring on board this season, but at least he'll have us two.",2013-05-21

A delicious morsel of  history from the last comment by J M Rees:

> as a twelve year old I wondered what the excitement in the Loft was when the Club announced what the attendance for the match was. The canny fans wanted to see how much cash was being filtered off, no credit cards, players paid in cash, £80 PW or an ex-international for £100 PW. There was usually a guffaw of laughter when the figure was announced.

The attendances issue sounds like a big gamble, especially if the rumours today about this 35k seater Air Asia stadium are on point.

* If he stays, Green in goal.
* Keep Bothroyd and Mackie but we will need to fish out a striker with pace and a better touch than the latter  - possibly on loan. Maybe keep Johnson and SWP in the rotation too.
* If Taarabt wants to stay, let him. He's young, on the books until 2015, and should be given a chance to earn his crowd chant back. Not sure what the accountants will say though - if they need to sell him I can see them doing it early in the window.
* Diakité, Faurlin and Jenas in the middle. Would like Hoillett to stay. Possibly Ephraim too.
* Traoré, Hill, Onuoha, and Yun Suk-Young at the back. Derry as supplementary, along with Luke Young if he returns from the grave.

But this lot...I'd like to think reducing the transfer fee to offset some of the higher wages we'd be passing along could be a strategy, but I doubt that would suit the agents taking a percentage cut?

* Cesar - Surely need him off the wage books.
* Remy - Au revoir.
* Bosingwa - Would love to find a buyer but if not he'll burn £3.5 million a year. Awful piece of business, but at least he'll pay a lot of income tax.
* Granero - Higher hopes for finding a buyer for him. Hasn't impressed but apparently QPR's best percentage passer this season (up until a few weeks ago).
* Park - his 'Asian Beckham' brand will hopefully take him elsewhere, even if it means taking a pay cut.
* Samba - Not sure who will match his wages - hasn't actually impressed much since arriving. Not sure he will want to return to Russia.
* Cissé - Has bagged 5 goals in 6 games in the UAE - fingers crossed we can ditch him on a permanent deal somewhere similar.
* Barton - Sell him to Marseille, assuming they want to keep him. Can imagine he'd make a modest salary hit to stay there too.
* Zamora - Surely no chance of selling him with his dodgy hip. He'll be a striker from the bench for a season before retiring. Expensive.
* Mbia - Would probably be valuable in the Championship but I think we'd find a buyer quite easily, despite some of his poor decisions. Seems to love to get stuck in.
* Ferdinand - Still haven't forgiven him for MK Dons. Not sure why Bursaspor took him on. Suspect we will be lumbered with him - although perhaps he won't struggle for a first team place at that level. ",2013-04-28

"I first saw him play at Wickham Wanderers in a Pre-season friendly. I was very surprised at how very far forward he played for a defender; taking the ball right up the other end of the pitch, down the middle. He played like an attacking mid-fielder. Then running full-pelt back to defend when needed.

He's matured through this season. He seemed to keep attacking under Hughes and forgot about his defensive responsibilities at times and on occasions came across a bit Keytstone Cops. That has changed under Redknapp and he has settled into a proper defensive role, while providing an attacking threat on occasions and a mid-field role, connecting up the play on the wing. He shows flashes of skill and an increasing self-confidence. I'd say he's like a short David Luiz, but out on the wing.

I think his brother still shows an edge on him, though that could be largely down to who he has playing around him and his teams comfortable position in the league table.",2013-03-17

I think we will stay up. We showed enough today. It was only a very poor show from a usually excellent Cezar that stopped us winning the game.

I'm not sure if Cesar was still 100% as he did not go for the ball like he normally does.

Some positives in the game and we now play a lot more of an attacking game but it all comes down to the fact that we really needed the 3 points",2013-03-16

"I love the fact that they said ""Taarabt can't do it all by himself"" when that is exactly the problem. 85% of the time he is the only one showing any promise on the field so I don't blame him for trying.

"Let's not listen to some speculation coming from a scorned side who lost a brilliant defender.

Samba proved his worth in the PL with Blackburn Rovers.  Six seasons of consistent first-team football followed until spring 2012, when he was bought by Russian side Anzhi for € 14M.  His departure preceded Blackburn's drop to the Championship, where they had been promoted from ten years ago.

Fact is, he a big, strong Congolese defender and will give us the presence we need to seal up our defense.

The real problem we have right now is a lack of chances up front.  If Harry Redknapp can figure out how to put together that puzzle, we will have first row seats to a Cinderalla survival.",2013-02-12

"""Jamie Mackie (1758 votes, 72%)""",2013-02-05
"Impromptu, probably shitty translation:

I have contacted supporter groups of all 20 Premier League clubs and asked them to nominate a player from their own team. The primary criteria has not been their ability, but what the player's relationship with the supporters, media, referees, teammates and opponents is like. In addition to the thoughts of the supporter groups, I have asked Nettavisen's sports journalists for their opinion, and thus I have both the supporters' and the media's viewpoint on each candidate.

The supporters' judgement: Mackie is the player who gives all for the club. Limited technical ability is compensated for with an attitude on the pitch that players with much higher wages can be envious of. A crowd favourite! He was a strong contributor to QPR's promotion from the Championship, and no self-respecting supporter will ever forget the equalising goal in the away game against Derby County, four minutes over-time; nor the winning goal against Liverpool, three minutes over time.

The journalists' judgement: not a player most people know much about, except that he scores a goal now and then. I was helped a little by TV2's talented commentator Jørgen Klem here, who told me that Mackie is a player who gives all and never complains, who loves playing football, never pronounces himself negatively about anyone and has an attitude the fans love. ""Need more of them. They are few"" (?) said Jørgen. Sounds like a good candidate for this competition, if you ask me.

"First half was poor -- so it goes, that's okay. But in the second half we were in complete control of the game for 30-35 minutes in which time Norwich must have had at most 3-4 sustained attacks. We had crosses, corners and free kicks en masse from dangerous positions and we were able to move the ball around at will -- we had about as much offensive pressure as we could have asked for. And yet we do not score.

What does it take for us to score, exactly? A penalty? Ah, nope. Not even that.

The only thing you can blame it on is Rémy's absence, but really, it's not much of an excuse. Mackie and Zamora should have got it done between them. It says a lot when the best chance of that entire spell of dominance came from a shot outside the box.

"Our defence had to deal with few real threats. Samba was great, Clint was mostly good, made a couple of small mistakes, but team mates were able to deal with it. César was his usual excellent self. Townsend was our man of the match with a stellar performance, he's very talented and drove the ball forward at every opportunity.

The problem with our attack has been the same all year, the rest of the team doesn't move forward when a QPR player has the ball. The other players are stopping still, ready to run back into defence. There was some improvement in the 2nd half, but not enough. Finishing was poor, Taarabt's penalty was very tame. Heider would have scored it.

Mackie kept creating opportunities out of absolutely nothing, but has lost his finish.

I don't see Remy as the saviour. He'll score a few goals for us but his perfect scenario is what we saw at Wet Spam - up front, with Zamora in support, with 1 or 2 defenders to beat and the goalie to shoot past. Besides, by the sounds of it, he's sort out for a while now.

Harry's done an amazing job with our defence. If table position was decided on goals conceded we;d be 7th in the table, now we need to out attack.",2013-02-02

"Pleased with the point, considering we got mullered in the second half. The first half play between Taarabt and Remy looks like it's going to be a great partnership. Yet again Cesar kept us in the game more than once, SWP had another great game. Got a bit of a rest before City, which if we play as we have been, we might be able to nick a point from. Shame Reading and Villa (as of now) won, but we'll just have to do it ourselves. Onwards and upwards! ",2013-01-19
"I'm pleased with Remy's goal, but I feel that we nearly gifted West Ham the match in the second half. We did a great job retaining possession in the first half, but I feel that we couldn't turn over the ball fast enough in the second half. Mbia... Jesus could he complete a pass?

Beyond QPR, it looks like Villa and Newcastle are now in a race to the bottom, and this should hopefully help in our quest to stay afloat. It'll be interesting to watch developments at Southampton as well, as I'm not sure if Pochettino can conserve the momentum from Adkins recent run of good form as well as connect with the players.

iViva the Redknapp Revolucion!",2013-01-19
"What a tease.  Seeing the live table on bbc when we were 1 up was such a good feeling.  No longer in last, and only 2 points away from being out of the bottom three.  It wasn't a lose, but damn would have been a great win. ",2013-01-19
"I would've taken the point before kick-off, but the way we scored so early on before becoming the inferior side as the game went on is concerning. What is also concerning is Reading's freakish ability to pick up wins they have no right to, as they have recently. Combined with the dramatic slide of Villa and Newcastle it makes it difficult to know which 3 sides we're actually trying to overhaul in the points tally.

However, if the bit in bold in Doeboy's post is true it's definitely a reason to be optimistic. Harry's R's are unrecognisable from Hughes'.",2013-01-19
"Honestly, we really needed a win here.  I'm disappointed we only got a point.  I'm also disappointed the team fell off the wheels after about 30 minutes.  Unable to generate any sort of offense, with the silver lining being Remy's goal.

Ji-Sung Park seemed to get pushed off the ball much too regularly, probably due to his small size.  Mbia once again seemed to lack quality, a player I often criticize due to misplaced passes.  We seem to have a lot of trouble holding the ball up midfield, hopefully M'Vila can help us out in that area.

Overall, not really pleased with the single point here, as I said up above, we *really* needed this win.",2013-01-19
"Realistically we really need a win here.  This is a very winnable game that a motivated QPR side could take away from West Ham.

I'm really excited to see how Remy shapes up, and would be ecstatic if he could score on his debut.",2013-01-18
"A look at West Ham's league form:

Dec 1: W3-1 vs Chelsea (H)

Dec 9: L2-3 vs Liverpool (H)

Dec 16: D0-0 vs West Brom (A)

Dec 22: L1-2 vs Everton (H)

Dec 29: L1-0 vs Reading (A)

Jan 1: W2-1 vs Norwich (H)

Jan 12: L3-0 vs Sunderland (A)

Which means of their last 7 league games, they've picked up 7 points and scored 8 goals. 

It's a very possible game. If we play with the same grit we had against Chelsea or Tottenham, if Remy hits the ground running with a goal and the defence maintains its good form, we have a really good chance at winning this one. It's just about turning up and giving it all we've got.",2013-01-18
"Stats point towards a low scoring game. Plus it's bound to be difficult conditions. Key points are to be as competitive in central midfield as we have been in the last couple of games, and hope our old defensive set-piece nightmares don't come back to haunt us.",2013-01-18
oh jeez probably one of the most devastating qpr games to watch this season was when west ham travelled to loftus road and we literally made them look like nothing short of barcelona. It was terrifying how good we made them look. Diame just basically stuck his boot right up in our arsehole and just kind of gently set it off in a circular motion as he looked for the warm spots in there to comfy. I hope this match is nothing like that.,2013-01-18

"If we make two signings in the January transfer window, that being, Remy and M'Vila, we will be OK.  You start to get into problems when you are signing 6-7 players and trying to integrate them into the team in a short period of time.  Chemistry goes out the window and the form of the team will show it.  As far as financials go, both these players will have release clauses in their contract if QPR goes down, which means they won't bankrupt us if we are relegated to Championship.  If we stay up, we will have more than enough money to carry these players and it won't be a problem at all.",2013-01-17
"I honestly think the financial penalty of yo-yoing in and out of the Premiership is nowhere near what it used to be. If we get relegated we will not be in trouble financially. We currently have zero external debt and a committed, rich owner.",2013-01-17
"missed the match yesterday but will see highlights later, fantastic result for us. shame about cisse really, but you often see in a 90 minute game he rarely looks menacing for no longer then 5-7 minutes. we also signed remy which will hopefully improve the quality up at the top. ive seen bothroyd play, and though technically a sound player he doesnt have the speed to play in the top flight, too slow, sadly that does not work anymore. 2 quality goalies is always a positive, however we will see how they play in the matches that actually matter. im rather dissapointed with arrys dedication to the cup, thought it should definitely have taken a back seat to staying up in the prem, baffles me why our first team was playing last week, though i didnt see the line up for last nights fixture. top stuff cickle funt wish i could be there too",2013-01-15

"A draw against Tottenham is a great result. We couldn't have asked for anything more really. As far as Park goes I think he played very well and is an absolute asset going forward. Another player who deserves mention for their performance today surely must be Wright-Philips. Even though he was unable to finish his chances he looked dangerous on the wing. 

We have many games ahead where we will need wins.  I don't think today's fixture needed a win and really a draw is a fantastic result. ",2013-01-12
"Fabio was my MOTM today. Every single touch he made was a cut above the nearest spurs player and advanced our efforts massively. A close second is Derry, who was always underneath the lofted ball in midfield and was an absolute rock in the middle of the pitch. The only letdown was Park, who was the only player in a hooped shirt who looked unwilling to get stuck in and fight for the ball, preferring to stay in space and pretend he was guiding preceedings from afar. I would've replaced him with Faurlin or Granero at half time.

overall though, solid stuff and a great point to take.
",2013-01-12
"We must take heart from today's performance. Harry has created a real defensive strength in the team. We have no out-and-out strikers, so depend on some attacking mid-fielders for goals. We are desperate for a dependable goal scorer.

We need an average of exactly 1.5 points per game.",2013-01-12
"I'm still 50-50 on Redknapp. I definitely think he's the only man for the job at the moment but don't see him as a long term option. I think he generally tells things how they are, usually very open. Many have described him as a premier league Warnock and I'm inclined to agree, candid yet honest. Probably won't hang around if we get relegated either.

Obviously a lot of what he says panders to the fans but it's definitely a step up from Mark ""Never seemed that bothered"" Hughes. With the predicament we're currently in the fans need to hear this kind of thing to keep them behind the team. Not sure I fancy our chances tomorrow but I haven't really fancied us in any games so who knows. 

I think our main problem now is that none of the players we really need would likely come to the club for the right reasons. Players that we need right now are ones that can cut it in the premier league and have the desire to perform. The only real incentives to come to QPR at the moment are likely for the money, as a step up from their current or to prove themselves and try and get picked up by a bigger team if we go down. That leaves us with players that probably aren't good enough or more mercenaries. We just have to hope that anyone that does come in falls under the category of trying to prove themselves.",2013-01-11
"I'll judge Redknapp on his results, as I have all QPR managers. Hughes was awful. He was given every opportunity and advantage to take QPR to the top half of the table and took us to the bottom.

So far Harry's had some good results. If he keeps us up I'll say he's a good manager.

We are currently a club of mostly over-paid under-performing unprofessional players, who are not particularly interested in QPR, but more concerned with their own careers should QPR go down.",2013-01-11
Redknapp is a class manager who can really bring QPR to great heights.  I have every faith in him as a manager.,2013-01-11
"Son this is nuts.  Harry has scouts searching in leagues all over the world he doesnt need your help.  Also, Adebayor hasnt been listed don't believe what you hear unless it comes from a good source.  Hes going to ACON.  Bendner is out until August and cant be transferred right now and in all honesty isnt very good.",2013-01-10
"If this is true and QPR have suggested he needs to look around, I'll begin to despair at our club.

We are becoming a hostel for transients.",2013-01-10

I just hope it will not distract him from his game.",2013-01-08
"This is great news, he has been far and away our best defender this season, possibly even best player all together. Would have to be up there as one of my favourite players right now, what a great bloke for hanging around, I bet you can't name more than 7 players in squad right now that if given an easy exit like this wouldn't take it straight away, and that my fellow fans has been the number one problem with QPR this season from the get go, no heart for the club, none of the players care if we stay up or go down. The only players I have seen actually care if we win or lose are Nelson, Mackie, Hill, Derry, Faulin and maybe Granero when he first came to the club. I see this slowly changing under Harry though thankfully. Sorry for the rant.",2013-01-08
"37 or 38 points usually gets you safety.

We currently have 13 points.

Another 7 wins (21 points) takes us to 34. Plus 3 draws = 37 points.

BTW: West Brom is an FA CUP game.",2013-01-08
"Let me try to come up with enough points from the games that are left:

**Norwich**: They have only got 1 win in there last 6 games which was an unconvincing home win against Wigan, they seem like they are about to start sliding down the ladder.

**Southampton**: Definitely not beyond us to obtain a sneaky away win against the other Relegation contenders.

**Sunderland**: Managed a nill all draw at the Stadium of Light last time against Sunderland and in strange turn of events QPR actually had more possession and more shots, should go one better against them at Home and create some momentum with two wins in a row.

**Aston Villa**: Could go either way here but I am going to back the R's to win this one and to notch up there third win on the trot, Aston Villa have been very unconvincing all season and I am still sticking by the prediction I made at the beginning of the season that they will get relegated.

**Fulham**: I know it's an away game but for some reason we seem to really lift against West London rivals, it will be a tough game but we will have all the momentum and chants of Harry's greatness will be heard all across West London.

**Wigan**: Wigan have been very poor all season only getting one draw and one win in there last 8 league matches and are a serious relegation chance at this stage. This may seem ridiculous but I believe this could be QPR's fifth win in a row, a run of wins that has not been seen by the R's since the League One days of 2003.

**Reading**: After a couple of losses (or draws) we will get revenge for the defeat earlier in the season away from home. Reading are poor and will finish bottom.

The rest of the points would have to be made up with draws, maybe Newcastle, Stoke, West Ham and Aresnal. I am not saying this is going to happen, it is a long long shot I am merely calling my prediction and it is every chance that I will be way off but hey, a man can dream can't he?

"http://www.qpr.co.uk/news/article/080113-nelsen-toronto-586505.aspx?

He's still available to play on Saturday. Anyone know when he'll actually leave us?

Edit: the MLS season doesn't start until March, but it seems as though he'd need permission from QPR to leave before the end of the season. It looks as though he may yet stick around for a while.

Edit 2: ""I've had several conversations with Harry and [club owner] Tony Fernandes,"" the New Zealander said.
""They have been so understanding with my situation.
They understand that when I play I am playing on glass knees and glass ankles. It is a bit of a struggle.
They know I am at the end but they also know the predicament they are in. It is a major predicament.
QPR would like me to keep playing but we have to sit down and talk. If we can get five straight wins, that'd be perfect.
I think then we can shake hands and part company but we are just going to have to talk and see how things progress.""

"Great to hear DJ is straight back in. Hulse I'm very surprised about as neither he nor Bothroyd had impressed on loan. Top marks to Harry for giving them a chance, they are on the pay roll after all and perhaps not bringing in so many new faces will pay dividends.

Really happy to hear Young is in training. I know he was injured but also heard about fallings out with Hughes.",2013-01-04
so will Cisse be sold now?,2013-01-04
"Just so everyone is clear on this, none of these players are *new* signings.  I think most of you already know this but just so no one gets the wrong idea.

Rob Hulse has been with QPR since 2010 and was signed for €975k.
Jay Bothroyd has been with QPR since 2011 and was a free signing.
DJ Campbell has also been with QPR since 2011 and was signed for €2mill.

All three of these players are in their 30's and will not likely have a lot of chances to make their mark in the first-team.  I am thinking that Redknapp may try to replace Cisse with one of these attackers.  Personally I do not think any of them will fit the bill.  DJ Campbell is the only one who I think might have a chance, but I guess we will have a better idea tomorrow.

In reality, I think QPR will still need to buy a striker.

"Spot on. 2 things I'd like to add. Adel was asked to play up front on his own, holding the ball up, usually with little or no support. He did it brilliantly and selflessly. Those who watched us in the championship will remember that teams used to foul him early on in games so that he'd get his sulk on. He was fouled constantly last night but kept going until his 90th minute substitution.

Secondly, there was a revealing display of team spirit and professionalism from an unused substitute. Ali Faurlin warmed up almost constantly last night, and was the only player who did so without tracksuit bottoms on, ready to be called into action at any point. He never got the call, but at the final whistle ran onto the pitch and bowed down to Sean Derry, giving him the 'worshipping' gesture for his outstanding performance. Compare that to ex-scum Bosingwa, who refused to even sit on the bench. The disparity in professionalism and attitude between these two camps in our squad is vast.",2013-01-03

They believe that building the infrastructure, including a bigger ground, is the way to prosperity.  If relegated, I doubt they will commit any funds to actually building a new stadium, beyond the planning stages.

They will concentrate of attracting young talent going forward and working on the Youth Academy to build an army of Uber Super Hoops.",2013-01-02
"I don't see how it can be anything other than a loss for us. I think a good showing and only losing by one or two goals would be a decent result. even Harry Redknapp can't get this rag-tag bunch to perform consistently. Mbia sums that up perfectly, plays a couple of cracking games, then spends the whole Liverpool game like someone who's never kicked a ball in his life. Just shows there's far more wrong at the club than simply we had a bad manager.

The club are really making it difficult to enjoy following them let alone watching the games.

"I agreed with all of that apart from the last sentence. Frankly, if we go down I do not see us returning to the top flight for at least a decade. 

The Championship is full of shit-hot teams built from the ground up to thrive in that environment and push for the big time. QPR on the other hand is full of ageing, self-important mercenaries who cannot seem to muster any enthusiasm to play against the likes of Liverpool - so imagine how riveted they will be at the prospect of an away trip to Huddersfield or Brighton.

Unfortunately Fernandes' naivete has cost QPR dear and his ""death or glory"" recruitment policy has backfired massively. Wage demands will not be met, players will be discarded en-masse and the Rangers will struggle to remain in the Championship with a bare-bones side.

The upshot of this is that it'll most likely be youth players that'll come to the fore, and if they do manage to gel into a coherent unit we will have a strong platform to rebuild the team and get back into the Prem. But that's a big 'if'.",2012-12-31

"First time in a while I've listened to one, the main reason I stopped was because I had had enough of Finney's petulant childish bollocks. 

Shame it's not changed because the others are good! ",2012-12-18
"A striker and perhaps a central defender. 

No big purchases. No massive reformations in the squad. These are the players we've got, they're the players we've got to stick with -- and they're good enough to get the job done. Reinforcements in the right area help, but sacrificing steel, grit and a fighting spirit for new players is what got us in this mess in the first place.",2012-12-18
"We need a striker who can hold the ball up. I keep hearing it said that QPR need a goalscorer. Thing is, we have one in Cisse. We need to start getting the best out of the players we have instead of replacing them when they're out of form. What we haven't had since Heider is someone up top who wins headers and brings other players into play. Zamora should be that type of player but isn't. It would help us protect leads, which is something we are currently spectacularly bad at, because when the run of play is against us we invite pressure by never having an outlet up front.

Our best defenders are not ball-players, they are old-style ball-winners. They will not and should not be looking to launch attacks. They are there to defend. When under pressure, they should simply clear it. If we had someone upfield who can turn hopeful punts and clearances into possession, it enables our defence to focus on defending.",2012-12-18
"Lampard is a great mid-fielder, his work rate at Chelsea is stunning. He was the only Chelsea player who impressed me when we bet them at our place last year. But.... we have no midfield issues, so to stick in Lampard would f**k things up for no good reason.

Anelka? I'm not feeling it. He only wants the cash and, again, it would be pushing aside the likes of DJ Campbell.

I'm fed-up with us sh**ing on our own players. We are very lucky to have some very loyal servants, yet we keep treating them badly. Can we not learn anything? It has to stop.",2012-12-17
"I would say Anelka is pretty likely, unfortunately. The Times today thinks that Sir Les is on his way too.",2012-12-17
"When a team is dominated like that it's always difficult to know whether it's because the other team simply bossed them or because they are really very poor.

For much of the game our players chased everything. When M'bia fell over and lost possession he chased the ball until he got it back. SWP did the same.

It's the most confident we've looked all season and what a difference it made, that has come from being undefeated since Harry joined.

We still need to keep closing down opposition players, that's what cost us the Fulham goal.

Let's aim to stay unbeaten. Confidence is the key to everything now.",2012-12-15
"Have to say we should have got them few chances at the start and it's something to work on, we are getting better but we needed to keep the pace last 10 mins of the 1st half was poor for both sides nobody could keep the ball at all and that 4 mins of extra time OMG I was on the edge my seat could just see us giving it away last few seconds Green had to work harder in extra time then he did all game!

Pleased with the team effort today they played well and put effort in something I think Harry has drummed into them never let the ball go if you do you chase and get it back not put your hands up and admit defeat like we have seen a few times this season

Let's hope that was the kick up the bum we needed and work on getting in a few more points",2012-12-15
"I am just so happy that the boys got a win. I thought it was going to be a sad day for me but it turned out to be the happiest of days. I may be getting ahead of myself but Newcastle aren't in good form having lost six of there last eight matches (Fulham more recently), if we can manage to break our away loss record up at St. James' that would really give me something to smile about. Can't remember the last time we won two league games in a row, must have been back in the closing stages of the Championship. Definitely getting ahead of myself.",2012-12-15
"Honourable mention to Onouha, we looked a load more solid at the back without Bosingwa and Ned had a good game. Mbia is so good defensively but I thought Faurlin was great today too. He makes up for a lack of pace with excellent positioning.

It's bliss when we're winning with Faurlin and Taarabt on song. Like old times.",2012-12-15
"I'm just going to have fun, score be damned.",2012-12-14
"I think we're going to lose, maybe badly. Fulham's coming off a win and I think Harry's just trying to get the team to January 1st before he really starts to do what he wants.",2012-12-14
"I went back to find this (http://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops/comments/y35ty/where_will_qpr_finish_and_why/) thread and wanted to cry. The wheels have really come off, and it's only now that life is settling down in anticipation of the holidays that I'm beginning to fully appreciate how horridly wrong the first half of this season has gone. There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic - it feels like much more so than for plenty of other clubs - yet week in and week out we come up short.",2012-12-12
"Having watched the team seem gradually more solid and organised on the back foot under HR I still don't see where the goals are going to come from, tbf there were enough chances against villa but chances don't equal goals with out that final touch.

"Sounds like he strained a neck muscle.

In the olden days you'd have had to play on, like the Man City goal keeper Bert Trautmann did with a broken neck in '56.",2012-12-02
"It was so frustrating, so many chances wasted. I thought we were more unlucky than incompetent - the injuries to Mbia and Diakite held us back. The first took away momentum when we had the game by the scruff, the second unbalanced us tactically (Hoillet stood out wide on the left, but we continued to try and attack down the right, where Diakite had been making forays). Then we ran out of steam, without the subs to get fresh legs. Park and Derry weren't nearly as effective as a central midfield pairing.

Chances of staying in the league are slipping away, though not yet gone completely.

Edit: one other point - Traore really needs to improve his fitness. We were carrying him for the last 10 minutes. As an attacking left back, stamina is a huge part of his game.",2012-12-02
"I'm definitely scared of Benteke. He's exactly the kind of player our central defence struggles to deal with -- and he's in good scoring form at the moment. Having said that, it's difficult for anyone to score without proper service from midfield, and with the Mbia-Diakité combo that worked well against Sunderland, hopefully we'll be able to boss the middle and prevent him from getting too much service.

Granero had a pretty poor game against Sunderland -- he's looked a bit off for a few weeks now, hasn't he? -- so I would quite like Faurlin to have a chance to start. 

I also hope 'Arry gives Fabio a chance to play. Mbia did his job well at RB against United but I was surprised that Bosingwa was preferred to Fabio against Sunderland. Imo, Bosingwa is one of those players who looks like he really doesn't give a toss about where the club ends up. Fabio has a point to prove to SAF. 

Anyway, I'm hoping for and predicting a resurgence, with Benteke getting a cheap one off a corner (as usual), but QPR ultimately prevailing with a 2-1 win. 

Come on you R's. ",2012-11-30
"I think confidence is just beginning to set in at the back and may start to emerge at the front tomorrow. Cisse needs to pull his finger out, he can go in January if he wants to, before then he needs to show he's worthy of the attention of other clubs.

"It's so frustrating to hear pundits carry on about 'free spending QPR'. After the Southampton game the Match Of The Day pundits spun a narrative on the game of cheaply assembled Southampton outplaying the expensively assembled QPR. Southampton spent £20 million on 2 players.

That having been said, both Giroud and Dede were long-shots at best, and it was naive not to have a plan B in place. Having to scramble for reinforcements at the end of a transfer window rarely results in good business.",2012-11-27

Oh well, better than playing shit and losing, I suppose. Hopefully 'Arry can turn it around against Sunderland. We have officially the worst start to a premier league campaign ever now, don't we?",2012-11-25
"It was a great game for Harry to have watched because in many ways it was the club in a nutshell. He's already seen that:

* We can't defend set pieces (as an aside it was so annoying to hear Trevor Francis on commentary banging on and on about Fergie's tactical genius in making his subs. We conceded two soft corners to players already on the pitch. Fool).

* Mackie is fantastic against the big clubs, particularly away from home. He changed the game at the Emirates and was dangerous yesterday.

* Cisse needs guidance. He looks lost. Good cross for the disallowed goal though.

* Taarabt is hugely important to us. I'm worried Harry will use him as an impact sub, having let him go from Spurs, but should have noted yesterday how he's changed as a player since those days.

* SEAN DERRY!

"Let's face it, once we lost against Southampton in the way we did, we were fucked with Hughes.

Even Fernandes, with his limited footie knowledge, could see there was no way out with Hughes at the helm.

Apparently other board members wanted Hughes out sooner, it was the fans, who were split as to whether Hughes should be given more time, who were lending some weight to Fernandes' position. Once that went,
 it was only a matter of time. Rednapp's sudden love for eastern Europe did the rest.

"I'm afraid the poor old Tony has been hoodwinked by Hughes and his really dodgy agent Kia Joorabchian. 

This letter makes interesting reading as I'm sure Tony wouldn't have departed with Neil Warnock if he had of seen this reference.

I once met an ex Sun Journalist and it would seem that even though Tony owns the club there are other forces at work that controls the players and the managers. Sounded a bit dodgy to me but its working out true with Hughes.",2012-11-18
"The bookies have Redknapp as favourite to take over, with Hughes at evens to keep his job (until next week at least). Sven comes in at about 2/1.

If I were Fernandes I'd have a go at poaching O'Neill from Sunderland. He's not got the best record and Sunderland are sh*te, but he gives depressed teams an immediate boost and that's what we need. It's not too late to fight relegation.",2012-11-18
"Not a QPR fan but I took up an interest in the club after all the exciting signings they made this season and I've been keeping an eye on them. I really believed that people should have some patience and believe in Hughes, until I caught some of the Southampton game. God damn QPR were hopeless. They didn't seem like they had a plan. All I saw was players trying to dribble past 3 or 4 players by themselves, with zero support around them. When I checked the result later on, I was surprised they even managed to score a goal. I think Hughes has had enough time to show how terrible of a manager he is. Bring in Redknapp.",2012-11-18
"I've been a staunch supporter of Hughes through all of this, against any further disruption to our club, I was prepared to give him till Christmas.....However, I'm at the end of that tether already. We've put arguably our best team on the field 2 weeks in a row and failed to get anything against teams we should be getting points from. The management appears to have done all they can, the players look disinterested and don't seem to be playing for the shirt or the manager. I never thought I'd see the day where Taraabt looks to be player out there trying the hardest.

I don't know if Redknapp is the answer but I do now think it's time for Hughes to step away.

Side note, I read that O'Neill could walk away from Sunderland if they lose at Fulham. If so, could be in for a shout?",2012-11-18

This has gone beyond embarrassing.",2012-11-18
"Not even going to go into how badly we need to win this.

Southampton hammered Villa 4-1 and since then they've drawn two games and lost four. In these six games they've conceded 14 goals, so 2.3 per game; and in their last three games away from home they've conceded 9. 

On top of this, Southampton should be easier for us to deal with than Reading, since Reading play down the flanks, while Southampton's style is quite similar to ours: they like having possession and passing the ball around. Our total inability to defend crosses should not be as important against the Saints as against Reading or Stoke. 

If our strikers weren't misfiring so much, I might even be confident. As it were, I am nowhere near confident. Nevertheless, my incurable optimism strikes again as I play Taarabt in my Fantasy team instead of Crouch. 

Prediction: 3-1. Come on you R's.",2012-11-16

"My 2 cents: I really don't know what to think. I've been a strong advocate and supporter of Hughes even with the rough start we've had. I still believe that we need stability and everything I hear and read suggests that he still has the full support of the players, however....

Something is wrong. I don't know what it is, whether it's players not interested, tactics not quite right, poor recruitment, I just don't know. We have now played a full season of away games without a win, that is unacceptable. We are over a quarter into the season and are without a win, that is unacceptable. 

Will a new manager change this? Again, I don't know. Yesterday appeared to our strongest team with current injuries and suspensions. We played some great football in the first half, much like against Spurs yet we concede another stupid goal from switching off and we can't put the ball in the net. Taarabt has been arguably our best player in recent weeks but should have almost scored a hattrick, confidence is definitely an issue at our club and I fear we're building too big a losing mentality.

As for change of managers, as I said before, I'm not 100% convinced we should, however the more we lose, the bigger the above mentioned losing mentality grows. Who else would we get?? Harry Redknapp? I'm not totally convinced by him, who else is available that could do a job? Rafa Benitez maybe? Honestly, who would take on this job now?

Personally, if we lose against Southampton then we're in dire, dire straits and that's when we start looking for change, as for what/who and if it will make a difference? Well....things can't get much worth.",2012-11-10
"It dawned on me recently that given how the season has progressed so far the most realistic best case scenario is Premier League survival, and even if we do achieve it somehow, would we want Mark Hughes to stay on as manager next season? The answer, for me at least, is a resounding no.

I think the only thing stopping Hughes from getting the sack right now is the lack of a suitable replacement and Fernandes' pride.",2012-11-10
"I don't know what the problem is either. Whenever we get a chance to score a decisive goal we miss it -- Taarabt's failed chip is case-in-point as well as that last-minute chance against Reading. Then we concede some bullshit goal from a cross and finish the game with 0 points, or 1 if we're lucky. We switched off for half a second in defence and Charlie fucking Adam scored. 

Again, I don't know what the issue is with this team at the moment, but will changing the manager help us score those chances? or help us stay alert at the back? Unfortunately there is no top-class manager lined up who could take over straight away. I really, really don't want Redknapp. His entire managerial style is based on buying players; tactically, he is not better than Hughes. 

Who then? The last thing we need is more uncertainty, and unless there's a proven manager ready to swoop in, I don't think uprooting the entire backroom staff and bringing in more new faces to a team that looks like they met each other yesterday is a good idea. 

It's tough, but I still believe that all we need is that first win. We put one of those chances away, get our three points and we'll be on our way. ",2012-11-10
"Every game is a must-win now. I can't believe we haven't won at home in the league since that Stoke game. Unbelievable. 

If we could beat them away with the team we had then, I have to believe that we can beat them again with the improved team we have now.

Having said that, their aerial playing style and our defence ... Crouch ... Mbia suspended ... no away wins in a year ... this will be a toughie at the very least.",2012-11-08

"Stoke will fancy their chances. They need points and will be encouraged by QPR's dire results.

Expect plenty of aerial action and set-pieces from Stoke and a rather poor attacking finish from QPR as we battle against their stern defense.

I can see red cards for QPR as Stoke will be aware of our awful disciplinary record. Perhaps a red for Diakite or Bosingwa.

Based on our previous performances; unfortunately, I predict a Stoke win.",2012-11-08
"This is the first *real* must-win game of the season. We've lost points where we shouldn't have but tolerated it because we knew that we were going to have games like this one, against teams closer to use in the table, where we can make amends. 

Well, the game we must not lose is here. If we do lose, our situation is doubly bad: not only do we stay in 20th place, but we allow Reading to advance up the table. If we win, on the other hand, not only do we gain three points, but we prevent a rival from progressing upwards. Lose, and we continue our trend of uncertainty, poor self-confidence and calls for the manager to resign. Win, and our heads are held high when we go to Stoke and take on Soton at home.

Reading are away and a point ahead of us and therefore this game is not quite as crucial for them as it is for us. As for us, though, it's not just the fans who know the importance of this game; the constant reassurances we've heard from the players, manager and owner show how strongly they're feeling the pressure to pick up points. They know we have to win, they know this is our best chance to do so and I think they're going to work their socks off for it. For that reason I'm going to make the incredibly credulous and probably wildly erroneous prediction of 3-0 to the Super Hoops.

"Starting to tire of this trend of dignified losses. When we lose, it's always a narrow defeat (except for Swansea). We're never outplayed, but we lose anyway, and always by the one goal. 

The scapegoats are obvious today: Mbia and the ref. Arteta's goal was blatantly offside. Furthermore, I haven't seen any replays yet, but it seemed that when Hoilett chipped the keeper, it was Zamora who was offside, not Hoilett. 

Mbia. What the *hell* was he thinking? I'm absolutely bloody sick of these stupid red cards. We had *so many* of them last season, so many cheap sending offs, from Diakité's incessant yellow cards to Barton's red-because-it's-Barton against Norwich to Taarabt's ridiculous sending off for toe-poking the ball 10 meters away to Cissé's unnecessary rash tackles that cost us points and contributed to our relegation struggles, something which I'd *very much* like to avoid this year.

And it's not that I really mind losing away against Arsenal. They are very, very good at home; that's not where we should be getting our points. But it's impossible not to be frustrated when we had the draw in our hands, then Mbia gets sent off like that and they get a goal that shouldn't have stood.

6 points against Reading and Soton or we're in trouble *for real*. 

Edit: I'M GOING INTO R/SOCCER GUYS WISH ME LUCK",2012-10-27
"I think it is especially an issue that we don't have a single player to chose from that can score at the moment, Cisse and Zamora are both off their games and Johnson is injured. Meanwhile Helguson has scored 4 from 11 and DJ Campbell has scored 2 from 4. Can i just ask why Mark Hughes is so scared to change things up? What is he worried about? We can't fall down that ladder any further.",2012-10-27
"I reckon if they'd won in the CL then it would have been better, they will certainly be fired up, Arsene will probably give them a stern kick up the arse and maybe even the fact that Arsenal are currently having their AGM will put even more pressure on them. I think it could lead them to them be up for it. 

However, that said, I think they are just he kind of team we could get up against, they like to pass the ball around too, don't have a real enforced to terrorise our defense and are not that special from set pieces, it could be just the game we need. Also, if we get an early goal the crowd will get on their back and could be the initiative we need. I think they have a bit too much quality for us and predict the same I did for the Everton game, 2-1 loss, maybe 1-1 draw with a bit of luck. ",2012-10-25
"Is there ever a good time to play Arsenal at the Emirates? They may have lost to Norwich and to Schalke but they are still Arsenal, and we still haven't won away since November 2011. When was the last time Arsenal lost three in a row? We should be grateful for any point here and focus on getting 6/6 against Reading and Soton. 

Having said that, we do have a chance. We are quite similar to Arsenal, actually: we prefer to play on the ground, we're not a predominantly physical side, and battles in the air are not our strong suit. Hopefully, against Arsenal, we'll avoid conceding more shitty goals from crosses and corners. We are not better than Arsenal in midfield; against Arteta and Cazorla there is no way that we're going to be in a position to dictate anything. Therefore, I can only really see us having a chance if we successfully man-mark Cazorla, crowd the midfield with any three of Park/Granero/Diakité/Faurlin, put pressure on them as soon as they approach our box as Norwich did and counterattack with Taarabt/Hoilett/Cissé. As Munkey said, an early goal and the fans will turn on them. ",2012-10-25

Cesar - Solid, top top keeper, unfortunate for the OG. Some people complain he flaps or punches too much but that's just his style and he generally gets good distance on the ball. 7/10

Nelsen - Once again proving to be a great addition and just a shame he isn't 10 years younger, commanding and what he lacks in pace he makes up for in positional sense. Felt he could have done better with the header in the first half though, should have scored. 7/10

Mbia - I reckon once he settles in to the rhythm of the league he'll be an absolute weapon. Great composure, good on the ball, does like to go forwards alot (I realise he prefers to play as CDM) but was assured at the back, I'd like to see him do a bit better in the air too. 8/10

Bosingwa - Again, a reasonable performance, did well in keeping Baines and Pienaar reasonably quiet. Felt his crossing was poor this game though and communication with other defenders was an issue at times but that's a whole defense more than just a Bosingwa issue. 6/10

Traore - Hopefully he can get his fitness back because he makes such a difference than when we've had to put Hill at LB. His pace is such an asset and he links up so well with Taraabt down the left side. Arguably our best crosser of the ball too, just needs to work on positional play a bit more. 7/10

Park - Did a job this game without being spectacular, I think he does a lot of grunt work that people don't give him credit for and had some great sliding tackles but too many misplaced passes and spent too long on the ball a couple of times. 6/10

Granero - What a player this guy is, so assured on the ball and links up brilliantly with the rest of the midfield and the attack, his ability to turn with the ball in a tight area to get away from his man is incredible. Controlled the midfield and has a decent set piece on him, once settled he could be our best player this season and for me, joint man of the match 9/10

Diakite - Quiet first half, didn't really get involved much but changed it all around in the second. He has raw talent in abundance, the ability to glide past players is a beauty to watch just needs to lock down some consistency. Still he scares the bejeebus out of me everytime he goes in for a tackle, it's either a brilliant tackle or attempted murder. If he can keep that second half performance up he'll be a superstar. 7/10

Taarabt - Again, undoubted talent in this guy and was shown in the first half, everytime he gets the ball he is so unpredictable, long pass, short pass, trick, shot, you never know what he'll do. His link up play has improved by worlds and him and Traore had a fantastic understanding down the left side this game. Was fairly anonymous in the second half though, again, needs to get involved a bit more. 8/10

Zamora - A workhorse performance albeit a slightly disappointing one. Defensively he was absolutely woeful and at fault for the goal conceded. For me he didn't win enough in the air either. Everton looked to have 2 people on him at most times which made it difficult for him but he should be doing a bit better. Couple of poor decisions and some of his passing needs to be a bit crisper but I'd keep him in the team to try and bully Arsenal's defense next week. 6/10

Hoilett - Hasn't been given enough of a chance this year for me but proved his worth this game. He was just all energy, running forward, tracking back. Great ability to cut inside players and shoot and was only denied a couple more goals from some great saves from Howard, I like him in that front roll working off Zamora and if he can keep the same energy levels and work on his final product a bit will score a hatful this year. My other joint MoM 9/10",2012-10-21
"Thought Diakite was fantastic yesterday. Still a bit too heavy and late at times with his tackles, but otherwise superb. Some of his successful sliding tackles were top-draw.

Mbia is not just skillful, he scares the crap out of the opposition. I saw him with the ball being approach by an Everton player 3mts away; Mbia faked a lunge forwards with a scarey face. The Evertonian flinched and Mbia switched to his left in space. Quality stuff.

Thought our defence looked much better, still an occasional minor panic, but overall much improved.

Lots of good performances apart from our 2 strikers.
I thought Zamora mostly had a stinker of a game. If he's going to have the task of holding up the ball he'll need to win it in the air more and successfully pass it to our players. 

What we lack is a striker. Cisse is off his game still, lost his mojo. Because these 2 aren't scoring we're struggling.

Everton went down to 10 men with 30 mins to go. We should have won the game; it was a great opportunity.

Looks like our goals are going to have to come from mid-field. Back to the tactics of the end of last season when Cisse was banned a lot.

Hughes still does requests. The crowd calling for Cisse meant he came on instead of Mackie, who I heard Hughes was warming up.

"Disclaimer: I'm not in a position to know what's happening behind the scenes. The following is based on rumor, hyperbole and years of inexperience.


The 2 biggest factors affecting QPR at the moment are *The 2 I's*....


**1. Instability**

Many managers, owners and huge volumes of players have passed through QPR in the past few years. This makes a poor basis for any football team, no matter what their level of skill and experience.

For several reasons Hughes does not know his best eleven; one reason is that the best eleven probably haven't appeared on the pitch together yet.


**2. Injuries**

I think at one point recently we had 10 players injured. Again, that is a recipe for disaster at any club. Our fortunes will not begin to change until this damage is repaired.


**Hughes**

Let me state the obvious: Hughes has changed too much too soon. I think he's been dogmatic about ripping out old players who were reliable enough to get a few goals in each season and could be trusted upon to scrape a successful, if unattractive, defensive performance when backs are against walls.

All of the football world knew QPR had a poor defense in need of strengthening and depth. Hughes left it until the dying days of the transfer window, after being f**ked by Swansea,  to acquire some defenders (aside from Nelsen & Fabio).

I see a football snobbery to Hughes' player selection, a desire to play top-level football before the team can even walk, using highly paid players from top-flight teams and old friends, rather than taking reliable talent, perhaps even from lower leagues. It shows a real lack of pragmatism that the likes of Warnock survive and thrive on each season.


**The Facebook crazies**

I am of the opinion they are casual supporters who don't often go to games and seldom watch a game on TV. Amongst other things they call for players who aren't even in the named 25 to start games(?). It's easy to type trash on a social media site - as many football players know - I just leave it at that. 
When I go to a game the supporters I speak to seem sane and level-headed. I've only once heard an older long-term supporter call for a manager to go (that was when an old workmate called into TalkSport after our 1-1 draw to MK Dons).


**Park**

He's obviously not captain material. He doesn't speak. Speaking is a basic requirement of a captain. Having said that, neither Warnock nor Hughes seem to give two hoots about the captains' armband, yet it usually seems to protect the wearer from being subbed - it wasn't until Barton was so bad, he became just too embarrassing, that he was taken off. At least Hughes has so far subbed Park once.


**Derry**

Won't score goals but is a captain of defense. We all know he was the practical captain during our promotion year. There are Facebook crazies who seriously believe Taarabt marshaled the team to success. I call that view retarded as I have no other explanation for it.
Derry has a very level head, very vocal and has a footballing brain. I suspect it is only Hughes' dogma that keeps Derry out of the line-up.

**Barton**

I don't care about his tweets, his personality or the music he listens to. I care that Barton was mostly sxxt last season. He single-handedly lost us at least 2 games by being pure sxxt. All our current midfielders are better than him. If he did anything slightly good in a game, many people watching TV would sing his praises. There's no reason on this earth to take him back into the fold during the January transfer window. I'm glad Beard has said there's no way back for him.",2012-10-08

But today, we turned up and, as you say, outpassed a passing team, a top-six side, on their own grounds. Granero, Park and Faurlin were superb, especially Granero -- not only does he have great vision, he works hard off the ball too. The goals we conceded were so, so unfortunate: one own goal and a lucky bounce off the bar after a César save. No, we deserved at least a point today and got nothing. 

Five games played now, three against difficult opposition. Two points. We're improving, but we can't afford to be ""getting there"" much longer now. It's going to be very important to get all three points against West Ham.",2012-09-23

Commentators were singing QPR's praises throughout the game. Hill was their man-of-the-match in the second-half.

Faulrin (they still can't say his name right), Cesar and Grenaro also won plenty of plaudits from the commentators.

"If form isn't an issue, you'd have Cisse up front all day. Hoilett would replace SWP. Not sure how we fit in Diakite and Taarabt - the latter probably replacing Park when we're at home or need a goal. 

On a side note it's interesting to see how Hughes regards SWP as a strategically defensive player. He brought him on at right back against Swansea. Against Chelsea it became clear that the instructions to the midfield were to close down in packs, get a toe on the ball, then spread the play with quick passes. SWP is actually really good at this - he's quick and has excellent reflexes, so while he can't tackle he can stick a little leg out and aid in dispossessing the opponent. Then once Faurlin or someone has gained control of the ball SWP nips off into space to receive it, and we can consolidate possession. So whilst he won't get on the game's highlight reels, he played an important part in the midfield four.",2012-09-16

Onuoha because Fabio scares the shit out of me when an attack breaks down and the opponents' counterattack begins and he's way too far up the field.

I feel like a dick leaving Mackie out :( but we have way, way too many quality midfielders now for him to be a starter. For the same reason, I think Park should start in a central midfield role: so we can allow pacier players to have the wing. 

And this leaves out Diakité and Johnson .. god this is difficult. We could field two midfields that are approximately the same quality.",2012-09-16
"Cisse is off his game at the moment. Constantly off-side against Norwich and crowded out in the last 2 games by good back 4s. I thought we could have benefited from another good striker purchase during the summer, I didn't have Johnson in mind.

Hoilett could be used to grab a few goals, perhaps even played as a striker; we'll see.

For me its still too early to decide our starting 11. We have Mbia to start sometime soon, he's supposed to be pretty awesome, that could push Ferdinand out.",2012-09-16

"The injuries scare me, but tying with the Champion's League winners is a good result. Easily could have been a win with a couple of missed chances, but they seemed to perform much better as a group than earlier games. I'd like to see Cisse get the start next week, but that could just be due to my supporting Lazio in the Serie A. Cesar looked solid, though. Overall, I think it was a positive result.",2012-09-15
"I thought we were brilliant today. In the end I was actually a little disappointed we didn't snatch it, it certainly felt like we had most of the possession...

If I was being cynical, SWP continues to prefer running the ball into a dead end rather than playing the sensible early cross, and Zamora looked unwilling to get stuck into the 50-50 challenges, like the rest of the team to a man were.

The midfield combo of Granero & Faulin is an extremely exciting prospect. There were a couple of times in the match where they looked almost telepathic. It was wonderful to watch them link up and read each other's play.

Julio Cesar outdid himself on his debut. He's everything Green isn't - strong, confident, calm. Just what we need between the sticks.",2012-09-15
"Super proud of the defence. Nelsen totally dominated Torres (how much he whines to the refs doesn't appear on telly), Bosingwa had a great game, Onuoha did too, and Anton was solid. Before the game I would have taken a point without a doubt, but after it, with the chances we had and missed, I'm disappointed we didn't leave with three points.

The biggest positive, though, is that we are seeing real improvement: we're playing much better. Three points at Tottenham is a definite possibility. 

Also, it's perhaps a bit early to say, but Hughes's more dubious buys like Nelsen and Johnson have really paid off so far. ",2012-09-15
"Cesar was great, but that job really should've been the captain's. I'm having a lot of reservations of Park's captaincy. He's a model professional and a very hard worker, but doesn't have enough aggressiveness me thinks (and the English skills to really command influence from others).",2012-09-15
"So happy with the performance, we played out of our skin. A fair few players seemed to be carrying knocks by the end but were still giving their all. Compare that to the constant whining of the Chelsea lot, and the anonymity of Hazard once his first few dives weren't given as fouls.",2012-09-15
"**Team**

Cesar

Da Silva | Bosingwa | Nelson  | Traoré

Park

Mackie | Granero | Hoilett

Zamora | Johnson

Subs: Diakité, Derry, Cisse, Mbia, Ferdinand, Faurlin, Green

*That was tough. We have so much depth in mid-field, it's very difficult to choose a definite starting line-up.*

*I also had to spend some time choosing the defense. We have a lack of left-footed defenders and I think we have stronger centre-backs than Ferdinand to start, plus we now have Mbia, surely one of the best full-backs in the PL.*

*Both Traoré and Fabio are naturally attacking-minded, so no matter how you line the team up we are likely to be pushing forward. I put Park in a defensive mid-field position to try and maintain a connection between the mid-field and the back four - in reality it'll be mostly a remaining back 2 (Bosingwa & Nelson) for most of the game, though even Nelson seems to go forward. Park's workman-like performances will be needed with 90% of the team in the other half for most of the game.*

"Thank you for the congratulations.

For most QPR fans it is a double celebration as we have also got rid of Barton to an overseas club. Outside of QPR fans many still think Joey is a skillful player, that he is just held back by his disciplinary record. I don't share that view. I think Barton is mostly a poor player. So it's great to see him go.

It was the first time in English football history QPR lost to Swansea at Loftus road and it was possibly our worst league defeat since the 1980's.

As Kinners said, the manager should take the blame for that loss. Our defense was  untested since last season and so become slow, Hughes then set the team up in a formation they'd never played before and told them to attack. He then put Wright-Philips in the defensive line at right-back and waited until the dying minutes of the game to bring on a defensive mid-fielder.

It's great to have these skillful and experienced players in the team, part of the reason for so many buys in the past 2 weeks is to cover-up Hughes' tactical errors and incompetence against Swansea. QPR fans have had their hopes built up by QPR  media guys, the new players are an attempt to ensure those high hopes have a chance of realization, despite Hughes' short-comings.",2012-09-01
"Wow! We are famous!

How can I introduce you to QPR in one Reddit comment post? I guess I can't. I'll have a little attempt here and see what happens.

During the 80's and early 90's QPR was often the top London football club. In fact, in the early 70's our stadium was considered an example of how modern stadiums should be built - difficult to believe that now. In the 80's we were the only professional club to have a plastic pitch, which we used to great affect.

Much of QPR history has been about emerging quickly from the lower leagues, doing well at the top level, being mis-managed, then falling back to the lower leagues to return again some day.

Our greatest players have included, Stan Bowles, Rodney Marsh, Les Ferdinand, Mark Lazarus, David Seaman, Gerry Francis [others here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C._players).
We won the League cup in 1967 and have been in several cup finals, including the FA cup final in 1982 (when I started supporting QPR) and the Milk cup in 1988.

The QPR stadium (Loftus rd) is set in amongst residential housing and there are plans to replace it in about 4-5 years with a 45,000 seater stadium, which is a big jump considering our current stadium only holds 18,200 people.

Hopefully other guys here will tell you more. [Here's some more history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C.). Also, you can use the links to the right of this subreddit for more info, video and even QPR music.",2012-08-31

"I agree with OP, but I'd be more than pleased with 10th. We have cover in all areas now, so in that sense the transfer policy has been 'safety first'. 

A great deal of goals conceded in the first half of last season came through set pieces - a problem I now consider to be fixed. On the other hand we don't pose much threat through set pieces either, so we'll struggle to pick up goals against the run of play. That puts more emphasis on our home form, where we'll look to control possession. Away wins will be rare. 

The league has a more direct look about it this season, especially with Allardyce and Coppell back in the Premiership. Even Arsenal have bought a target man. All teams pre-season should be practicing set pieces and organisation. Team ethic is hugely important - the big, direct teams will seek either to dominate or to frustrate, so we must be psychologically resilient enough to live with that. 

So my prediction is, loosely, we won't keep clean sheets when not playing well, especially away from home, but that we have enough about us to be above the scrap once we get to the end of the season. Final position: 14th.",2012-08-12

He was convicted of multiple counts of fraud in the 1980s, receiving two prison sentences. In 1986, in Milan, Briatore was convicted for 3 years for fraud and conspiracy. He was convicted for his role in a team of confidence tricksters who, over a number of years, set up rigged gambling games, which used fake playing cards. The judges described these as elaborate confidence tricks, in which victims were invited to dinner, before being ""ensnared"" in rigged games, that involved a cast of fictional characters, and realised enormous profits for their perpetrators. Later, Briatore was involved in the bankruptcy of Paramatti. He was convicted on various counts of fraud in Bergamo, for which he was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison. To avoid imprisonment, he fled to Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands. He never went to prison and he came back to Italy only thanks to an act of oblivion.",2012-08-06

We are at a vulnerable stage in our development, having only survived life in the Premier League by the skin of our teeth and with little help on the final day from Barton. So he must to go.


I was one of the people who booed Barton off the pitch at Loftus road, it was more instinctive than anything else. I'd had enough and hoped he would sort himself out, yet it looks like his issues run too deep, I suspect he's beyond help.


Tevez provoked Barton and like a well-rehearsed script Barton responded on cue.

Barton may be on a hurriedly put together contract, meaning he'll be difficult to sack. Nevertheless I hope his contract is terminated and he leaves the club without money having to be paid. If he does go I hope it's not on too bad terms.",2012-05-23

"**1. Jamie Mackie -** Just for his uncanny knack of scoring goals when we most need them. The man has immense bottle alongside his tireless workrate. The epitome of QPR.

**2. Clint Hill -** Pulled off a few absolutely epic tackles to keep us in games we had to win. Not to mention bending the laws of physics with that late back-header against Spurs (I think...?)

**3. Djibril Cisse -** Yup, 3rd for me. A born goalscorer and a player the R's had been crying out for. Banged in goals that needed banging in, when he wasn't suspended of course. That record of scoring or being sent off in every game... It just could not have happened at any other club!

**4. Anton Ferdinand -** Nearly always looks solid and reliable, he does not mess around when the ball is in a dangerous area and deals with it - exactly what you want in a centreback.

**5. Samba Diakite -** A genuinely exciting prospect. Putting aside how much of a maniac he looked in his first appearance, he has looked a class act ever since. The thought of him pairing up with Faurlin next year has me drooling...

**6. Sean Derry -** Not always as commanding this season as he was the year before, but has certainly had his standout moments, not least of which is beating Theo Walcott in a sprint for a loose ball!

**7. Heidar Helguson -** Back in the dark ages of the first half of this season, there was one man who looked head-and shoulders above the rest of his team, and the opposition defense in the penalty area. The iceman himself.

**8. Paddy Kenny -** Looked a shadow of his former self in the first half of the season, but turned it around just in time, pulling off some crucial blinding saves since the beginning of the Hughes era.

**9. Adel Taarabt -** Took his sweet time reminding everyone what a talent he is, but again, did the business when it was really needed. Still does at least one thing in every game that blows my mind. Hoping he'll get off to a flyer next year.

**10. Luke Young** - Remember him? I would still have him at right back over Onouha in my R's lineup, and he went on a bit of a remarkable scoring run at one point before getting unlucky with injuries. I hope he returns next year.

Honorable mentions for Taiwo and Traore - two brilliant, but very different left backs - Just a shame we can only play one of them at a time.",2012-05-18

Chelsea winning yesterday was good for us. Their best way of ensuring Champions league football for next season is to win the competition, they also have an FA cup final to compete in. More importantly QPR are playing well, we just need to continue our great form to Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

I still think we need to win 2 of the final 3 games to ensure survival, which likely means games against Chelsea and Stoke - both will be very tough games.

"You only have to look at Swansea and Norwich to see where we went wrong. Instead of panicking and assuming their squads needed replacing completely, they built around their existing team with a few carefully-chosen signings and have blossomed as a result.

Look at the XI against Bolton. The only men in the team who played for us last season are Derry, Hill and Kenny. You cannot bring in an entire team's worth of players and expect them to gel into a coherent unit in less than a season. Doing so was just wishful thinking.

Obviously hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I honestly believe we would have been better off this season without making any transfers. (Well maybe Traore, he's looked pretty handy I guess...)",2012-03-10
"We wasted a lot of time at the beginning of the season trying to assimilate Taarabt into the new team. You just don't have time to expend points figuring out your best 11 in the Prem, and as doeboy says we've struggled to identify the best position of key players. The only two who made the step up were Faurlin and Helguson and it's no coincidence that the terrible run of late has been when they are both unavailable. 

That's just one reason. The signings of Barton and SWP have been counterproductive (though I think Ferdinand has been decent), and it's unfortunate that the team as it is now face a pretty stiff run of fixtures. If the takeover had happened earlier in the summer it would all be different - you either have to completely restructure or incorporate new players into an old system. Rushing through signings on deadline day left us without a game-plan or a system of play, and since then we've been the opposite of the coherent unit of last season.",2012-03-10
Copycat. I use Taarabt in that position in Fifa.,2012-02-06
"Great vid. Nice to see Faurlin in action. As you may know, he's out for the rest of the season. Our midfield is suffering without him.
He's received a number of man-of-the-match awards this season and is seen by many hoops fans as our best player.

From what I heard, there were big disagreements between the two and tales of Barton trying to pick the team and feeding his concerns directly to Fernandes.",2012-01-20

"To some extent, I think the answer to the headline is ""Yes"". I think he had lost the ability to inspire.


I've heard it said that Warnock had overachieved with the QPR squad, since his departure he's said that he could have done with another year before going up to the PL.


I love Warnock, he has given QPR fans so much. I think he changed QPR so quickly it became time for a different manager.",2012-01-10
"Also watched it yesterday with my old man. Briatore is something else. He has no idea how to treat people with any respect and no idea how football works, everything was about his ego. He was even on the verge of sacking Warnock during last season when we just needed 1 point to win the league.

Bhatia comes out the hero, as we all know he effectively saved the club and seldom gets the plaudits he deserves. So glad he's involved in our club.

Paladini was in tears when we won promotion, he really seemed to care about the club, but I'm afraid he was too involved with Briatore to stay. We're likely better off without him.",2011-12-26
You can customize on the QPR site. I added the name of the living legend Shaun Derry to my shirt on the QPR site.,2011-12-17
"Taarabt? I don't think so.

Derry between defence and mid-field, Faurlin, Barton and SWP in mid-field, Helguson up front with Bothroyd. Bothroyd and Heider will punish Liverpool in the air in the box.

Expect Heider to be taken over by the spirit of the Vikings, his eyes a red fire of focused passion, oblivious to the rest of mankind, as he drives them into the back of the Liverpool net.

Come on you Rsssss!

See you in Liverpool tomorrow Kinners.",2011-12-09
"It'll be Henderson and Charlie Adam in the centre - the midfield battle will be the key. 

Pack the midfield, don't give Adam space to pick his pass, keep 50% possession and concentrate in defence. Do this and we'll give ourselves a great chance of getting a result.

The final thing to remember is that if the game is not going Liverpool's way they will attempt to increase the tempo and play more direct, probably through Carroll, to bypass the midfield. We haven't coped well so far this season when teams have thrown everything at us, we panic and lose points (see Norwich, WBA). We have to learn to keep calm and see out games.",2011-12-09

"I agree, he doesn't have the time and space on the ball he used to have in the Championship and it shows big time. Against lesser teams he may be able to produce some magic but against the top teams he is a waste of space mainly due to his lack of closing the opponents down and helping out at the back. He just gives the ball away in the middle of the pitch time and time again and then  drops his head and relies on Derry and Faurlin to clean up the mess left behind.

I'd much rather see Mackie start the next match knowing that his heart is in it and will chase every ball. Taarabt just looks like he doesn't care. I can't see him moving back to the Championship and no one in England will want him so I can see him going to a small team abroad somewhere, probably back to France. I think all the rumours of the likes of Lazio, Napoli, PSG wanting him won't mean anything after seeing his performances this season.

I am genuinely gutted as I wanted him to do well for himself and QPR but his ego has stood in the way. I feel he does have the talent to do well in the PL but is just lazy more than anything and thinks he doesn't have anything left to prove. I'm intrigued as to what his opinion of his performance is and whether he knows he's been a waste of space and wants to improve or is just deluded in thinking the rest of the team are below him which is why he can't do well.",2011-10-30
Faurlin is again the unsung hero.  He holds midfield but others get the glory.  Really hope he doesn't go to napoli.,2011-10-30
Even when he found space against Spurs he didn't look to run at players and get a shot off. And his distribution is terrible. We used to moan that he'd always forsake the simple pass in favour of something elabourate and ambitious. Now he tries to keep it simple and if anything gives the ball away even more.,2011-10-30

"Part of me wants to tell you to get out while you still can.

I could go into the history. It's an interesting story, but you might as well just Wikipedia 'QPR'. The actual experience of supporting QPR - what it's like following them day to day, and what makes them different from other clubs - is harder to grasp. I think it's fair to say that it's an eccentric club. We always seem to be heading in one direction fast, be it up or down (unlike, say, Aston Villa, who achieve a similar league position every year). This season is no different. Brilliant team performance to beat Wolves 3-0, followed by a strange and eventful draw with Villa, followed by a 6-0 battering by Fulham.

Eccentricity is also traditional in the players. Many QPR teams have been built around a mercurial, unpredictable attacking talent. See Rodney Marsh, Stan Bowles, Roy Wegerle or most recently Adel Taarabt (last seen on a bus heading up the Fulham Palace Road).

We have two mascots, both of them cats. The team walks out to the Darth Vader Theme from Star Wars. There is much about QPR that is difficult to explain, but feel free to ask any questions.",2011-10-02
